0.0,10.0," Hello and welcome to the GFW radio podcast. This is the podcast for November 22, 2006."
10.0,16.0, I am going to be talking very fast today because we don't have a lot of time and it's not retranots fault this time.
16.0,18.0, It's the retranots fault.
18.0,21.0, It's always been a retranot fault.
21.0,28.0, We got to skate through here because it's the holiday and there's like 10 people needing this room in the next hour.
28.0,37.0," But anyway, I'm here with the cast and crew of GFW magazine, which includes Ryan Scott, Darren Gladstone, right?"
37.0,39.0, Sean.
39.0,40.0, Sean Moloi.
40.0,47.0, Sean Moloi and Sean Moloi have not been giving you props for the last month or two now of being the man on the mixing board.
47.0,48.0, So thank you.
48.0,49.0, Sean the engineer.
49.0,50.0," No, yes gentlemen."
50.0,52.0, We're just a play.
52.0,53.0, So what am I doing?
53.0,55.0, We're going to get right to it.
55.0,60.0, And we're not going to talk about it much because we know we know what we're supposed to be talking about.
60.0,64.0," However, it was a huge huge week in the console world."
64.0,67.0," So yeah, we're acknowledging that that existed."
67.0,69.0," We came out, the PS3 came out."
69.0,70.0, I don't know if that's anybody here.
70.0,72.0," Darren you have a PS3, right?"
72.0,73.0, Yep.
73.0,74.0, I've been playing it.
74.0,76.0, And the rest of us do not.
76.0,78.0, And do any of us cared even have one?
78.0,79.0, I don't care.
79.0,80.0," You know, it's a great blue right player."
80.0,83.0," But otherwise, I'm going back to play or PC games."
83.0,85.0," Yeah, whatever."
85.0,88.0, I want a PS3 in a year.
88.0,89.0, I see nothing to play.
89.0,91.0," Yeah, that's exactly it."
91.0,92.0, Seriously.
92.0,94.0," With most new console launches, I don't get with the rushes for me."
94.0,95.0," It's just, I don't know."
95.0,97.0, It's like everyone's racing to get it.
97.0,99.0," Say they have, you know, but I can say they got it first."
99.0,101.0, But really the good games don't come out for six seven months after.
101.0,104.0, The Wii I can see because it's all about with the PS3.
104.0,108.0, I just feel like like the second day these guys take it home.
108.0,110.0," And they're like, I got on first."
110.0,111.0," I'm taking to be sitting there, living there."
111.0,112.0, I'm going.
112.0,113.0," Oh, right."
113.0,117.0, I actually most of those guys are trying to sell us stuff on eBay as quick as possible.
117.0,118.0, Yeah.
118.0,119.0," Yeah, whatever."
119.0,120.0, Yeah.
120.0,121.0," I, whatever."
121.0,122.0, I'll see you in a year.
122.0,124.0," I mean, I think I sell the way about props."
124.0,130.0," Some people I just spoke to were insisting that, I mean, this isn't news, but it's good to hear again."
130.0,134.0," That the in BD8, 88 hundred totally."
134.0,139.0," Not only, you know, it's not only a substantial leap over the 70, 800, but they're insisting that."
140.0,151.0," And they be like people that are affiliated with a very prominent developer, insisting that it's the biggest jump in graphic cards text since the introduction of the original G force."
151.0,152.0, I want that.
152.0,159.0," But so so in terms of the consoles that they were, they were just happy that for once instead of having to wait six months until after."
159.0,162.0, Next gen consoles launched to catch up with the PC or to leapfrogum.
162.0,168.0," In this case, they say that that the 80, 100 light years ahead of what PS3 and 360 can do."
168.0,169.0, It's exciting.
169.0,172.0," Well, in any case, it's expensive and exciting, but yeah, it's all relative."
172.0,180.0," I mean, like you think about it like back in the day you had to buy, if you wanted to get the performance out of this card, you could have to buy like two 79 hundreds or 79 50s."
180.0,182.0, And each one of those cards cost 600 bucks.
182.0,184.0, And here you got one card cost 600.
184.0,185.0," And now of course, go down."
185.0,186.0," Yeah, it's all relative."
186.0,187.0," I mean, there's already like lower cards."
187.0,192.0," So like there's going to be a GTS version that goes for 450, which is still going to be solid performer."
192.0,193.0, It's total lot of money.
193.0,194.0, It's still a lot of money.
195.0,196.0," Yeah, we got some of this."
196.0,197.0," Yeah, we got some."
197.0,200.0," Yeah, actually, and our ish destroys your ish."
200.0,205.0," Well, the thing is, like, we got shiny here, just shiny your giant crabs."
205.0,207.0," Shiny your gecks, shiny your smases."
207.0,208.0, More grease.
208.0,212.0," Oh, well, they've since Nvidia provided the graphics for the PS3."
212.0,214.0, They had an early jump on knowing what the next gen was all about.
214.0,216.0, So they could leapfrog themselves pretty quick.
216.0,217.0, Yeah.
217.0,221.0, And they said by large developers were requesting higher grease content.
222.0,224.0, They want to be able to make a shine.
224.0,225.0, They want that shiny grease.
225.0,227.0, They want that shell act action figure.
227.0,229.0, That's the point on a on a game box.
229.0,231.0, Shiny shiny shiny.
231.0,232.0, What was that?
232.0,234.0, Was that a Chrisco city killer?
234.0,235.0, Was that.
235.0,236.0, Everything.
236.0,237.0, That's all.
237.0,238.0, Better on Chris.
238.0,239.0, But I'm a bit on Chris.
239.0,244.0, And then that was also the Wii and I think two of the GFW members now have we.
244.0,245.0," No, three."
245.0,246.0," Oh, not two."
246.0,247.0, I'm sorry.
247.0,249.0," Oh, I was mean."
249.0,250.0, Poor the salt.
250.0,251.0, I'm poor.
251.0,252.0, I'm poor.
252.0,253.0, Sad.
253.0,254.0," Because, glowed all you want."
254.0,256.0, I didn't like the those of us that don't have them didn't wait and some.
256.0,257.0, I didn't wait.
257.0,258.0, The bunch of mouth.
258.0,259.0, I don't have.
259.0,261.0, They need a neck beard.
261.0,263.0, Remove or attachment for the Wii.
263.0,264.0," No, not."
264.0,265.0," No, not."
265.0,266.0, It's like.
266.0,267.0," Like, oh, he doesn't."
267.0,268.0, A neck beard.
268.0,269.0," I mean, like not a neck."
269.0,270.0, We.
270.0,271.0," Oh, that's fun."
271.0,272.0, And neck beard flow.
272.0,273.0, How to get it.
273.0,275.0, So to line overnight.
275.0,277.0," Sean, the lie waited overnight in line."
278.0,279.0, Sad moment of my life.
279.0,280.0, I don't know.
280.0,281.0, I don't know.
281.0,283.0, What are the conversations in that line sound like?
283.0,286.0," Yeah, well, you're aware that in every Zelda."
286.0,289.0," Lake, the protagonist's link is actually different."
289.0,291.0, Like Batman.
291.0,295.0, But in the various incarnations over the years.
295.0,297.0, I will read a blog about this.
297.0,299.0," No, let's not be condescending."
299.0,300.0, Is all those okay?
300.0,301.0, In the doors?
301.0,302.0, Namises.
302.0,303.0, Will he appear?
303.0,304.0," Well, he not."
304.0,305.0, Of course.
305.0,306.0, You know all the characters.
306.0,307.0, Yeah.
307.0,308.0, Yeah.
308.0,309.0, What do you mean?
309.0,310.0, Yeah.
310.0,311.0, I want to just phrase myself away.
311.0,312.0, What do you mean?
312.0,313.0, Yeah.
313.0,314.0," I mean, we were all able to do this play one of them."
314.0,315.0, You know the characters.
315.0,316.0, Yeah.
316.0,317.0, How is there?
317.0,318.0, Yeah.
318.0,319.0, Yeah.
319.0,320.0, That was the conversation.
320.0,323.0, Just.
323.0,324.0, Just.
324.0,326.0, Ben and about how they're flipping link around.
326.0,328.0, Because he was right.
328.0,329.0, Yeah.
329.0,330.0, Right.
330.0,331.0, Now he's yeah.
331.0,332.0," Oh, he was left handed."
332.0,333.0, He was left handed.
333.0,334.0, Probably.
334.0,335.0, He was left handed.
335.0,336.0, Probably.
336.0,339.48, that did a link switching from left handed right handed to that
339.48,343.48," InfoNs GameSpot's, you know, the Tori's 8.8 score."
343.48,344.44," Thanks, again."
344.44,345.28," Thanks, again."
345.28,347.48, It would have been an 8.9.
347.48,348.32, If Zelda was.
348.32,349.32, Where did you put it?
349.32,350.12, 7 handed.
350.12,351.12, Or an 8.7.
351.12,352.92," I'm not making fun of games, but."
352.92,354.72, I'm not.
354.72,360.44, I just I was actually happy that their review scandal displaced our
360.44,361.6, review scandal.
361.6,363.76, So I don't even know what it's a scandal though.
363.76,364.76, I just did it.
364.76,365.76, I had a scandal.
365.76,371.28," At least, it was scandalous before people had even really begun playing the game in any"
371.28,372.28, number.
372.28,375.76," I've come all the sudden, like, now there's an automatic 9.5 to 10."
375.76,376.76, Exactly.
376.76,378.76, How dare you go below.
378.76,382.15999999999997," Suddenly, it's like the revolt of the internet crowd."
382.15999999999997,385.0," Like every other few that comes up is, you know, not so."
385.0,386.0, This has been the way forever.
386.0,387.0, Yeah.
387.0,388.0," Yep, it's a game."
388.0,389.84," You know what's different though, is it?"
389.84,391.59999999999997," Like, I guess, well, yeah, you're right."
391.59999999999997,392.59999999999997, The server's been there too.
392.59999999999997,394.0, I think maybe it's like no.
394.0,396.04," We're, we're stupidly responding to it."
396.04,397.72," It's probably the, yeah."
397.72,398.72, The difference.
398.72,403.16, Like I responded to the never win or night's saying and then game spot responded to the
403.16,404.16, Zelda crowd.
404.16,405.16, Yeah.
405.16,407.56, I think the thing is we have to ignore you fucks listening to the spot.
407.56,408.56, That's the answer.
408.56,409.56, Yeah.
409.56,410.56, That's the answer.
410.56,411.56," It's like, the never."
411.56,414.04," Like, never win or I, it's for example, like you just couldn't win."
414.04,415.76," I mean, you try doing the right thing."
415.76,418.68," And then someone jumps in here for being like, oh, thank good, good to back down."
418.68,420.68," I don't like, no, we were trying to do the right thing."
421.0,423.88," You know, this thing is a lot is ancient history now."
423.88,428.92," It's the internet half life as Sean Mayset is past on the story, but I,"
428.92,432.2," you know, I just expect, I'm, I'm glad we pulled it and I'm glad I wrote the blog"
432.2,436.08," explaining why I'm, I'm happy with the new review up there."
436.08,437.52," So, all as well."
437.52,438.2, All as well.
438.2,440.4," You have been somehow quoted this second time, right?"
440.4,442.88," He was, yeah, but fortunately he didn't get paid."
442.88,443.88, Yeah.
443.88,444.88, Okay.
444.88,450.44," So, I won last console thing, which is this, I need to get Ryan his couple"
450.44,454.88," minutes of wall here online, well, you know, be cathartic here, get it at your system, Ryan."
454.88,457.24," It's not sharing, sharing is carrying on."
457.24,458.24," Oh, it's not that big."
458.24,460.52," Yeah, you've been like in tears in the office for two days."
460.52,462.16, I didn't have all tried to get away.
462.16,463.8, He's behind me in every like five minutes.
463.8,464.36, I hear call.
464.36,465.08," Hey, do you look for you?"
465.08,465.8, Have any more reason?
465.8,466.36, Hell yeah.
466.36,467.68, It's going to cost us a rest of the day.
467.68,468.8, But it's no big deal.
468.8,471.64," Yeah, not going to get one if I do not confirm."
471.64,473.92," Did I do, toyser, or else you're a York."
473.92,474.92, Did I?
474.92,476.92," No, no, no, no."
477.48,482.0," No, I, I waited in a line for for three hours to how far did he drive to get to that."
482.0,489.0," I mean, was we were in Central California to visit my parents, like coincidentally, you know."
489.0,492.64000000000004," But I figured, you know, small, nowhere's the old town."
492.64000000000004,495.04, I think I'll have an easy time getting that we here.
495.04,498.72, And I waited for three hours to be told that I was number 21 out of 20.
498.72,499.72," Oh, wow."
499.72,501.72," So, uh, wow."
501.72,505.08000000000004, You could have just been home playing a PC game.
505.08000000000004,506.08000000000004, Yeah.
506.08,507.08, That's right.
507.08,508.08, Listen to you.
508.08,509.08, You could be playing yellow.
509.08,511.84," But the whole time was like, you know, this would probably be so much better with, uh, with"
511.84,512.84, a Wii mode.
512.84,516.24," Like, that's the epitome of new games journalism."
516.24,518.92," You have to ask in every case, wouldn't this be better than the Wii mode?"
518.92,520.3199999999999, What would we do?
520.3199999999999,521.3199999999999, Ew.
521.3199999999999,522.3199999999999, Yeah.
522.3199999999999,528.4399999999999," So, this weekend, which was all that, all that crap, I was very busy playing two PC games."
528.4399999999999,529.76," And I, so I didn't care at all."
529.76,533.0, I got very addicted to 17.0180.
533.0,537.76," So, I wanted to give that game some props on air, because it's one of them little games"
537.76,538.76, that doesn't get a lot of press.
538.76,540.76, It's big over in Europe.
540.76,541.76, Yeah.
541.76,543.52," Don't you, is it Germans like it?"
543.52,544.52, Yeah.
544.52,547.76, That was not a real fart.
547.76,548.76, No.
548.76,553.04, Let's try to not have one of those as a play.
553.04,558.0," But it's, uh, one year, uh, city builder, economic sim type games, which many of us love."
558.0,559.0," Ryan, you're a fan of you."
559.0,560.0, I have that.
561.0,561.6, Yeah.
561.6,561.8, Correct.
561.8,565.28," Coventing your neighbors we, then, in load up the 17 or one, you've already got."
565.28,566.6, I'm very happy with it.
566.6,570.16," I've not, I've not played a city builder like this in a long time."
570.16,571.8, Do you play the previous games in the series?
571.8,572.64, I did not.
572.64,575.56," So, and, you can make a Hooverville's?"
575.56,576.32, You can.
576.32,578.04, You can make a Hooverville's.
578.04,581.0, I'm not able to move the other side of the park part.
581.0,582.0, Yeah.
582.0,584.0," You see, that's what happens with my cities."
584.0,585.0, I make a Hooverville.
585.0,588.6, I'm more of a Levitt town myself.
588.6,591.72," No, is it comparable to something like sim city or tropical?"
591.72,592.72," It's, yeah."
592.72,596.2," It's kind of like somewhere in between sim city and a tropical, say."
596.2,600.96," Um, yeah, there, you know, there is combat, but I haven't got there yet to be honest."
600.96,605.72," And apparently it sucks from what people say, but I'm not confirming or denying that because"
605.72,606.72, I'm not there yet.
606.72,611.16," But yes, I don't like when city builders try to throw combat into the."
611.16,612.16," Yeah, I don't either."
612.16,613.1600000000001, Things.
613.1600000000001,616.64," Well, that was your criticism with Caesar four, wasn't it?"
616.64,617.64, Right.
617.68,618.64, It's real time comment.
618.64,622.0," Like, is it switching to some other mode that's different than what you're"
622.0,623.0, playing?
623.0,624.84," Because like, you could say civilization has combat."
624.84,626.48," Yeah, that's different though, right?"
626.48,630.92," I mean, you're not like, last swimming units and throwing them at the other side, right?"
630.92,635.52," I mean, that's just more, it's like abstract and civ."
635.52,640.1999999999999," So you're saying it's this, that's, I think, you know, I think in 1701, it's actual combat."
640.1999999999999,641.1999999999999, Okay.
641.1999999999999,642.2," Yeah, I think."
642.2,643.2, But what do I know?
643.2,645.2, I'm only playing it.
645.2,647.8000000000001, And an age of Empire three is the other one that I'm getting into.
647.8000000000001,653.5600000000001," That mainly because in the first issue of GFW, we gave the expansion where she's a nine."
653.5600000000001,654.88, So that got me excited.
654.88,658.76," I hadn't played it, but so I booted it up and I'm very happy."
658.76,661.5200000000001, So the war chief's expansion really makes a big difference in him.
661.5200000000001,664.6800000000001," The war chief's expansion, I mean, Tom Czech said it in his review."
664.6800000000001,668.44," And I mean, they did like the, they kind of age of mythology this."
668.44,669.44, Right.
669.44,674.48, They took it away from the historical realism and just kind of went for it with the Native
674.48,679.28," Americans, which is really interesting because when I interviewed Bruce and the team"
679.28,684.5600000000001," way back when they were first making age three, they were super concerned and conscientious"
684.5600000000001,691.76," about the historical accuracy, especially as in terms of the Native Americans."
691.76,693.4, It's a touchstone.
693.4,699.28," You don't want to like have, you know, Tonto and there going, you know, you don't want"
699.28,700.84, to have what's the guy's name.
700.84,701.84," Tom, leave an Indian."
701.84,703.84, I don't tell me how from Frank Lawyer.
703.84,704.84, She's law.
704.84,706.84," Oh, yeah."
706.84,708.84, Smoke piece pipe with white men.
708.84,712.0," I mean, they had, they were very concerned not to do that."
712.0,714.84, And so I'm going to stop it for me.
714.84,715.84, The war cries.
715.84,719.84," Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
719.84,723.84," Sure, you can find it by."
723.84,725.84," Yeah, that's what they were trying not to do."
725.84,728.84, So it's totally not the Indian in the reference.
728.84,734.2800000000001," So, and, you know, they were having meetings with like Native American scholars and history"
734.2800000000001,735.2800000000001, professors around the country.
735.2800000000001,738.2800000000001," I mean, they were taking it really seriously when they made age three."
738.2800000000001,741.2800000000001," You know, to that credit, I think it was probably the right thing to do."
741.2800000000001,742.88," You know, to not step on anybody's tells."
742.88,744.2800000000001, And there were big debates.
744.2800000000001,746.6800000000001, Could the Native Americans be a playable race?
746.6800000000001,750.76," They didn't know what that, you know, how that was going to be perceived, you know, if you"
750.76,753.5600000000001, could fight as Indians.
753.5600000000001,756.1600000000001," So, but in the war, she's expansion."
756.1600000000001,758.12," They kind of said, yeah."
758.12,759.96," Whatever, it's a game."
759.96,762.16," And I'm, no, they probably didn't do it that way."
762.16,765.08," I'm, I'm quickly summarizing."
765.08,767.08, But they did let you play now.
767.08,768.72, You can play as Native Americans.
768.72,773.68," And the interesting thing is like, you know, they're kind of like the magic race now."
773.68,778.72," You know, they have like, they do like wacky, spiritual things, you know, like you can"
778.72,780.68, become invisible things like that.
780.68,781.84," But you know, it's cool."
781.84,784.16," In terms of gameplay, it's good."
784.16,789.64, I can add it this like nice creative element that just the same as age of mythology had.
789.64,790.64, Right.
790.64,792.0," So, gameplay wise, it's good."
792.0,796.0," And, you know, but I don't know if, I don't know, can Native Americans really turn"
796.0,797.0, invisible.
797.0,798.0, I don't know much about it.
798.0,799.0," You played prey, right?"
799.0,800.0, Other ninjas?
800.0,801.0," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
801.0,802.0," Yeah, it's right."
802.0,803.0, Everything in that is true.
803.0,804.68, They can go to that spirit realm and then come back.
804.68,805.68, Yeah.
805.68,807.4," Damn, it'd be cool to be Native American."
807.4,809.68, I can turn invisible.
809.68,810.68," And, oh, yeah."
810.68,813.28, Why'd I have to be white?
813.28,814.28, It's bad.
814.28,816.28, Some kids somewhere is going to go into class in history class.
816.28,819.88," And it's going to be like, you know, why are you trying to tell me it had to do with"
819.88,826.92," your P in horses and steel and germs and stuff when these guys clearly, you know, I"
826.92,828.56, were able to turn invisible.
828.56,830.56, That's not a serious fireballs.
830.56,833.56," Yeah, if it was learning history, it was a serious game."
833.56,834.56, It was a serious game.
834.56,835.56, It was a serious game.
835.56,836.56, It was a serious game.
836.56,838.8399999999999," So as anybody else from playing PC games, just me."
838.8399999999999,839.8399999999999, Yeah.
839.84,845.32," I've been foraging around with the freeware boards for, ah, for hundreds of them"
845.32,846.32, I'm free games.
846.32,847.32, That's right.
847.32,850.84," We're bringing back the legend that's, it's probably the best and worst time for me"
850.84,855.76, because I find so many great games and I've been narrowed down to 101 free ones.
855.76,856.88," You know, good free ones."
856.88,858.2800000000001, And this year is actually going to be really cool.
858.2800000000001,860.2800000000001, I got to our February issue.
860.2800000000001,863.96, February issue of gift abuse going to have that.
863.96,866.36, We are annual 101 free games.
866.36,868.96, The February issue that's going to be coming out in December.
868.96,869.8000000000001, Right.
869.8,870.8, Like a jitter.
870.8,871.8," Yeah, you're right."
871.8,872.8, What else?
872.8,874.64, So that's 101 reasons not to buy the games.
874.64,875.64, We're talking about.
875.64,876.64, Right.
876.64,879.16, The games that we're talking about for that are advertisers paid to advertise in our
879.16,880.16, magazine.
880.16,882.16, So get them just to screw our advertisers.
882.16,884.4399999999999," Yeah, and actually if you, you know, also I throw this out there."
884.4399999999999,885.4399999999999, If you guys tell them.
885.4399999999999,886.56, Jeff St.
886.56,889.16, Kicking the square in the nuts.
889.16,890.92," Actually, if you, I'm just going to throw this out there."
890.92,891.92, I'm telling you when listening.
891.92,896.28," If you come across any cool freeware games, send them, you know, I said, put up on the board."
896.28,897.28, Let us know.
897.28,898.9599999999999, I'm going to include extra stuff in the magazine.
898.9599999999999,900.56, If I missed it.
900.56,902.1999999999999," If I make one, would you put it in there?"
902.1999999999999,903.1999999999999, Especially people.
903.1999999999999,904.1999999999999, Awesome.
904.1999999999999,905.1999999999999," Make a, make a mod Jeff."
905.1999999999999,906.1999999999999, Okay.
906.1999999999999,908.1999999999999, What do you plan to?
908.1999999999999,910.56, Since you're guessing the consoles this week.
910.56,911.56, I'm not.
911.56,912.72, I've been like in between computers.
912.72,915.4399999999999, I'm just about to get this new rig set up.
915.4399999999999,918.48," And the first thing that's going on there is, I got three."
918.48,919.48," Oh, no."
919.48,920.48, Which I haven't had that.
920.48,921.48, That's going to put that on.
921.48,922.48, Yeah.
922.48,923.48, See if the board has been fixed.
923.48,924.48, No.
924.48,925.48, No.
925.48,926.48, That's just one of the things.
926.48,927.48, I'm just going to put that on.
927.48,928.48, I'm just going to put that on.
928.48,929.48, I'm just going to put that on.
929.48,931.48, That's just one of the things.
931.48,932.48, That's just one of the things.
932.48,935.48, Basically now I'm like in anticipation about what I'm going to play that.
935.48,937.48, I still been meeting and get around to flight soon.
937.48,940.48," Which has been, you know, likewise waiting for the new computer."
940.48,944.88," And then I've been away on business for our, you have been away somewhere visiting"
944.88,946.88, some people for some cover story.
946.88,947.88, It is.
947.88,948.88, Unfortunately here.
948.88,949.88, Can you tell us?
949.88,950.88, You're a big flare.
950.88,951.88, No.
951.88,952.88, That's the one thing you guys know.
952.88,953.88, I haven't even told anyone here in the office what it's about.
953.88,954.88, That's true.
954.88,955.88, I wanted to know.
955.88,957.88," And I said, now, I almost caved in."
957.88,958.88, Really?
958.88,959.88, Yeah.
959.88,960.88, I was caved in.
960.88,961.88, I saw something secret.
961.88,962.88, Yeah.
962.88,963.88, She could have asked you.
963.88,964.88, She could have asked.
964.88,965.88, I know.
965.88,966.88, She's secret.
966.88,970.88, I'm leaving for Boston on Monday to see the Titan Quest expansion.
970.88,971.88, That was a secret.
971.88,972.88, That's not a secret.
972.88,973.88, That's not a secret.
973.88,975.88, It's already been blown in some other magazine.
975.88,978.88, But you're getting what it has on with it.
978.88,979.88, Yeah.
979.88,980.88, I'm getting the hands on.
980.88,981.88, True.
981.88,982.88, True.
982.88,983.88, Yeah.
984.88,985.88, What did you have a heavy month?
985.88,987.88," Actually, Jeff, we should go to Dallas next week."
987.88,988.88, Were you playing Gothic 3?
988.88,989.88, No.
989.88,990.88, I was not.
990.88,991.88, I got the box by the game with the Sean.
991.88,992.88, Okay.
992.88,994.88, Because I got all busy with my strategy games here.
994.88,995.88, I'm happy.
995.88,997.88," Well, a patch just came out for apparently."
997.88,1000.88, So maybe they did or he fixed that stuff for Gothic 3.
1000.88,1001.88, For Gothic 3.
1001.88,1002.88, So.
1002.88,1003.88, Mly.
1003.88,1004.88, I know you have a wee.
1004.88,1005.88, Yeah.
1005.88,1006.88," Well, before the wee."
1006.88,1007.88, Yeah.
1007.88,1009.88," And before people who pin you out, I was playing medieval 2."
1009.88,1010.88, Ah.
1010.88,1011.88, Right.
1011.88,1012.88, You were viewed it.
1012.88,1013.88, Yeah.
1013.88,1014.88, I was going to go back to the game.
1014.88,1015.88, Yeah.
1015.88,1016.88, I have to watch it.
1016.88,1017.88, I'm going to go back to the game.
1017.88,1018.88, Yeah.
1018.88,1021.88, I've had trouble with the total war series to be honest.
1021.88,1023.88, I respect it.
1023.88,1025.88, I acknowledge it's goodness.
1025.88,1027.88, But I find that game very hard.
1027.88,1028.88, Yes.
1028.88,1029.88, You respected gaming goodness.
1029.88,1030.88, I do.
1030.88,1032.88, I did sort of like a lot going on in that.
1032.88,1033.88, There's like a lot going on.
1033.88,1035.88, Especially in the later part of a campaign.
1035.88,1036.88, It's really crazy.
1036.88,1038.88, There's so many factions doing so many different things.
1038.88,1040.88, You can't predict what's going on.
1040.88,1041.88, Yeah.
1041.88,1043.88," For my strategy games, it'll not be a little more intimate."
1043.88,1047.88, Can't you like an automate sort of parts of the process if you don't want to do some parts of it?
1047.88,1048.88," I mean, yeah."
1048.88,1049.88, There's a lot of automation.
1049.88,1053.88, You can actually totally skip the like big real-time tactics battles.
1053.88,1056.88, Because if it's actually a good thing because like they get kind of tedious when you're
1056.88,1058.88, just like yet another siege.
1058.88,1061.88," It's like, okay, here I am in front of another French village."
1061.88,1066.88, I don't want to go through the 15 minutes of the exact same thing I just did to the other French village.
1066.88,1067.88, So that's nice that you can do that.
1067.88,1069.88, Can you pay it like a EVE online?
1069.88,1072.88," You know, just set it up and then you get to that."
1072.88,1073.88," Hey, I won."
1073.88,1074.88, Awesome.
1074.88,1076.88, I'm for Raymey.
1076.88,1077.88, I won.
1077.88,1078.88, It's good.
1078.88,1080.88, I enjoy the campaign part of it.
1080.88,1082.88, The more turn-based strategy.
1082.88,1083.88, Yeah.
1083.88,1085.88, The tactics have really good.
1085.88,1087.88, Like it's super detailed when you get down close.
1087.88,1089.88, It just looks really awesome.
1089.88,1093.88," But like I said, I made mostly a campaign player in these kind of game."
1093.88,1094.88, Yeah.
1094.88,1095.88, The tedium.
1095.88,1096.88, What?
1096.88,1098.88, I'm trying to figure out there's like this sort of constant noise.
1098.88,1101.88, I can't even hear someone's voice.
1101.88,1102.88, I can hear something.
1102.88,1104.88, It's my Daredevil hearing.
1104.88,1105.88, Yeah.
1105.88,1106.88, Okay.
1106.88,1112.88, But you did mention the EVE two words there in passing the FIFA and the Pinata words.
1112.88,1114.88," No, we can't talk about it."
1114.88,1115.88," No, really fast."
1115.88,1117.88, It's a X-Box 360 game and it's awesome.
1117.88,1118.88, Why possibly came in the year?
1118.88,1119.88, It's like sorry.
1119.88,1120.88, I hate to say it.
1120.88,1121.88, Are you serious?
1121.88,1122.88, It's like the same series.
1122.88,1123.88, Everything I've heard about it.
1123.88,1124.88, It's like animal crossing.
1124.88,1125.88, It's not a cross.
1125.88,1126.88, It's not a cross.
1126.88,1128.88, The same meets the same meets Pokemon.
1128.88,1130.88, Big giant pacifier for man babies.
1130.88,1131.88, Thanks.
1131.88,1135.88," No, you say that like a bad thing."
1135.88,1136.88," No, I'll try."
1136.88,1137.88, Okay.
1137.88,1143.88, We're gonna take a break and come back with less hate.
1143.88,1144.88, Please.
1148.88,1151.88," Oh, hello, I didn't see there."
1151.88,1154.88," But as long as you're here, let me tell you about EGM live."

1197.3600000000001,1199.5200000000002, But it's a good passfire. It tastes good.
1199.5200000000002,1200.96, It's a good skill with candy.
1202.96,1208.3200000000002," All right, so we do have, we just finished our second issue of Game Swinders Magazine, and we're, I think,"
1208.3200000000002,1213.3600000000001," it turned out good. I think I'm a little biased. But I like it, but there's one story in, in"
1213.4399999999998,1218.9599999999998," that I'm really, I'm really psyched about in proud of that we did, which is that we sent our freelancer"
1218.9599999999998,1227.4399999999998," Robert Ashley over to Chernobyl in real life, real actual Chernobyl to check out the whereabouts"
1227.4399999999998,1232.8799999999999," of the game, stalker, which many of you might remember since we wrote about it. What?"
1234.0,1236.32," Four years ago, how long has that game been around now?"
1236.32,1238.7199999999998," We wrote about it actually, probably about five months ago or so."
1238.7199999999998,1240.9599999999998," Right, but I mean, when we first, when it first,"
1241.04,1244.88," well, he first wrote it up when, it wasn't even picked up by anyone yet."
1244.88,1247.2," Yeah, was in video, was using it as like a tech demo."
1247.2,1249.92," Exactly. So, we're not showing off what direct tech's nine cards can do."
1249.92,1252.72," Yeah, that sounds like anything. Yeah."
1252.72,1259.6000000000001," But so we sent Robert off there and he, he bravely ventured to the, to the area around the Chernobyl,"
1260.16,1262.88, nuclear power plant. Has anyone seen Robert since he got back?
1262.88,1266.24," Well, he has all his hair still, right? He does. His skin isn't green or anything?"
1266.96,1269.8400000000001," He's been, he's been trying to have a child, though, and they said it's about"
1269.84,1271.36, counter-bought nothing right now.
1271.36,1273.36," Are you kidding? I told you, joking."
1274.08,1275.6, How's it going to feel real bad?
1277.6,1278.08," Oh, shit."
1278.08,1279.6," We got article, man."
1279.6,1280.56, Yeah. Wow.
1280.56,1282.1599999999999," No, I think like he's dangerous."
1282.1599999999999,1288.3999999999999," So some of the dangers he, he recounts forest in the story are, I mean, just going through the red forest"
1288.3999999999999,1291.9199999999998," and just these random packs of now fair old dogs because, you know, basically, people"
1291.9199999999998,1297.52," would rip you out, just got up and left. And so, what were pets just kind of had to deal with"
1298.48,1303.44," the world on their own and they just, they didn't come fear like they didn't get, they're not like mutant dogs."
1304.16,1305.6, I'm not like the dogs in the game.
1307.36,1312.4," And so, I mean, the story was just incredible. I mean, and just, you crane in general,"
1312.4,1317.04," I mean, it goes into his hotel and, you know, on one side, there's just lines of prostitutes"
1317.04,1322.24," on the other, there's all sorts of weird gambling and that's just like part of the course there that"
1322.24,1324.6399999999999, you didn't make it. I hope he didn't expense that stuff. He didn't.
1324.64,1327.44, He didn't come out of the comics. He didn't come out of the comics.
1327.44,1330.96," He didn't come out of any mail order brides. You know, actually, he was kind of funny last time"
1330.96,1334.4," we had, we had it, we sent another freelance route years ago to check out stalker back in the day."
1334.4,1338.16," And he, I mean, he was telling me, basically, you get off the plane and they literally have like"
1338.16,1341.68, pamphlets for like mail order brides services if you want one. Wow.
1342.4,1346.8000000000002," Yeah, so the, I mean, the interesting thing about all this of course is, I mean, he's,"
1346.8000000000002,1352.48," the trip culminates and in a visit to the reactor, you know, now under the sarcophagus and, you know,"
1352.56,1355.76," they're, they're going there in the bus and they have got your counters all around and they're checking out."
1355.76,1360.72," But just the fact that they're engaging in this kind of eco disaster tourism for a game, you know,"
1360.72,1364.64," and then they go there and they meet in their guides or, you know, people that live in the area that work there."
1364.64,1367.28," And it's kind of like, so what do you guys hear for? It's like,"
1367.28,1369.76," we're all right. And how to feed you, okay, about this stuff."
1370.32,1371.52," I mean, it's like, yeah."
1372.48,1376.0," There's something about it. And definitely, I mean, and Robert handle it really well."
1376.0,1382.24," I mean, obviously, you know, acutely aware of the circumstances and how, you know, completely absurd."
1382.32,1385.92," It is, but at the same time pulling something out of there where the team that's making the game"
1386.56,1391.2," is actually, you know, attempting to, you know, it's one way. There are all these stories about what happened and,"
1391.2,1396.48," and that people use to sort of, you know, give it meaning and make sense of it in different ways."
1396.48,1399.36," And the game is, you know, looking at the game is one way to do that, you know,"
1400.24,1403.04," and then, you know, they're all the conspiracy theories around there and stuff."
1403.04,1408.56," But in terms of this kind of the trips, I'm sure we all had not never, I don't know,"
1408.56,1411.52, anyone's going to stop or Robert Ashley going to Chernobyl.
1411.52,1416.6399999999999," Yeah, but we've all had some interesting game-related excursions, though, right, halfway."
1417.36,1421.9199999999998," Well, the junkets circuits have always been kind of crazy, but they've toned down on the past couple years."
1421.9199999999998,1426.3999999999999," Yeah, you used to be a bigger deal. I mean, I mean, we should clarify. I don't know if"
1427.04,1430.8799999999999," why certainly didn't I don't know about anybody else here in your other jobs, but like we were as"
1430.8799999999999,1435.84, if Davis is not allowed to go like on the travel junkets. So like everyone wants to know
1435.84,1440.6399999999999," why something would show up like, you know, come to Spain and see whatever it'd be like the"
1440.6399999999999,1446.24," film music excuse, you know, but we're not allowed to do that kind of thing, right? Unless we pay"
1446.24,1450.24," unless, you know, the company pays for all expenditures. And that, and that's what usually keeps"
1450.24,1454.3999999999999," us from going because we're not going to go spending money for these crazy trips. Right,"
1454.3999999999999,1458.24," for like a half page preview. So like they just, like, they wanted Ryan, they wanted you to go"
1458.24,1463.9199999999998," at tomorrow. Go for a give-and-go. Really? Yeah, it was for nothing. It was like a release party for"
1464.0,1470.96," nightfall. Yeah, actually, uh, ethics suck. I know I got, I got an offer to go to, uh, to Paris"
1470.96,1477.04," for heroes of a night-related empires. Uh, yeah. Because it takes place in Paris apparently."
1477.04,1481.92, One bizarre one that I love to tell the story of is how to do with a rainbow six game and over
1481.92,1487.2," at the procedure here in San Francisco, they set it up and they had a bunch of, uh, the SWAT guys"
1487.2,1492.5600000000002," from LA come out and conduct exercises basically give us a crash like, like, Mark Horson, you know,"
1493.28,1496.72," you know, group movement and clearing, entering and clearing rooms and whatnot. And then,"
1498.0,1503.52," suited us up and, you know, all the requisite gear armed us with, uh, MP5s that shot pellets that"
1503.52,1508.32," shot rubber pellet that basically looked 100% like, you know, the kind of things they sell in Japan"
1508.32,1511.76, that they didn't want to sell here because it's basically a good way to get yourself shot in the street.
1511.76,1515.36, Walk around the toilet looks like a real thing. But so they armed us up with all that and then
1516.08,1520.1599999999999, put us into the back of these vans. And then the guy driving a van was one of the SWAT guys from LA.
1520.24,1524.3200000000002," And he was suited up too. So we had full head gear on, you know, our only eyes were sticking out."
1524.3200000000002,1530.72," We've got, you know, headsets on. And so he's taken us to this abandoned building in the park in"
1530.72,1534.48," the procedure to where we're going to go in and they have actors playing, you know, terrace whatnot."
1534.48,1538.48," We have to go in the building basically rescue some hostages and get out. But on the way there,"
1539.0400000000002,1543.92," so in a police San Francisco police officer pulled our van over like, god. Now all the windows are"
1543.92,1549.2," blacked out. There's five of us in the back sitting on crates with the, uh, the, the, our gun slung,"
1549.28,1553.6000000000001," you know, in front of us. You know, completely, we can't get out of this stuff because, you know,"
1553.6000000000001,1558.8," we've got a jacket on over it and, you know, we just completely tied down in this crap. And then the guy driving is like, we're like,"
1559.8400000000001,1565.04," okay, if this guy opens the back of this door, we are all dead. He's going to flip out. And this was back."
1565.04,1570.24," This was probably about, you know, I don't know, it was, it was 2000, if it wasn't late,"
1570.24,1576.56," if it wasn't the holiday of 2001, it was 2002. Okay. It was still raw feeling right. I mean,"
1576.56,1581.76," it was definitely not the time to be having that kind of, you know, mistaken identity thing going on."
1581.76,1588.24," And so we were, I mean, immediately, I just took my, I tried to get off my mask thing, you know,"
1588.24,1592.3999999999999," and I was like, guys, put your guns down on the floor right now. And because they first,"
1592.3999999999999,1596.48," the, so the officer is talking to the driver. And he's like, give me your idea and they got us like, hey,"
1596.48,1600.32," you know, we've got permits for all this and stuff. He's like, I'm, you know, I'm this and that,"
1600.32,1604.56," you know, LA and he's like, uh, I, he's like in order to get my idea, I'm going to have to reach"
1605.2,1609.6799999999998," into my, you know, my overall thing. And he's like, just talking around it. Thankfully,"
1609.6799999999998,1612.72," obviously the guy was able to communicate with him in a way that convinced him that, okay,"
1612.72,1617.2," if this guy is like the real deal or something, and it was just like awkward and he reached in and"
1617.2,1621.84," got his stuff in the guy was like, all right, on your way. But that was one of the more exciting"
1622.72,1625.6799999999998, game game games games. I was some of that had been if he went to jail.
1625.6799999999998,1629.12," Yeah, the actual like crux and jail. And the best part is,"
1629.12,1631.76, look at you guys like you'd be just like like terrorists. They wouldn't mess with them.
1634.1599999999999,1638.8, We're in there for a video game. So a lot of the ones I've been to have been ball stuff like that.
1638.8,1643.1999999999998," If not, you know, some went out and re-known and fire off a bunch of high caliber weapons and"
1643.1999999999998,1646.08," this and that, that was really good about ducking out of those ones. Like if there's like,"
1646.08,1649.6," you know, they're gonna try to do that. Like, I don't want to do that. The one like, hey,"
1649.6,1653.12," it's a game. I love Rayman, Rayman, Rayman, Rayman, so let's go look at a farm rabbit."
1653.12,1656.6399999999999," Like for me, it's like, I got to go and fire probably about like,"
1657.6,1661.1999999999998," yeah, we're not supposed to put the money out. But I know, I mean, I probably shot at least the"
1661.1999999999998,1666.56," $800 worth of ammo. I think it's just 50 cows and stuff. And I just sat there, like on full auto"
1666.56,1669.84," tearing up a car with it. Wow. That was probably good. Hunter bucks right there. And then,"
1670.3999999999999,1676.56," wow, I got a helicopter ride from, uh, signosis. And they came out here to, uh,"
1677.52,1683.6," they took all the games on all summer to the alamita, uh, whenever some naval base or something."
1683.6,1688.8," And then they flew us and helicopters across the bay, circled over candlestick park and, uh,"
1689.52,1694.8799999999999, took us back. And that's the thing I learned about that is I never wanted to go on a helicopter
1694.8799999999999,1699.6," ever again in my life. Really? That was hilarious. Now, I don't know. I don't just don't win."
1699.6,1704.32," It was scary. It was fun. So when I was in the building, uh, Christmas over EGM, like actually,"
1704.3999999999999,1710.24," uh, jumped from one. What? Like with, uh, it was like he won. It was another Ubisoft thing."
1710.24,1714.8799999999999," It was a mini boot camp and you had to win like whoever they, you know,"
1714.8799999999999,1718.48," whoever could do this and that, most push-ups in this, you know, the other physical activities"
1718.48,1721.9199999999998, would well-fank. You could trip in a black cock and then eventually you get to the sky.
1721.9199999999998,1726.32," I don't even want to get into your own new push-ups. Yeah, all kinds of stuff. Because it was"
1726.32,1730.72, it. It was a game game in journalists. I just kind of funny reminds me of when I could do two.
1730.8,1734.8," Ken Brown wants to boot camp for a couple days. You remember this? Oh, yeah. That's right. Like it was"
1734.8,1738.08," uh, for one of the metal of honor games, I think it was, uh, they had,"
1738.08,1742.24," Ken Brown a couple other journalists go to boot camp with Dale, Captain Dale die for a couple"
1742.24,1747.84," days. It was pretty fun. I guess my best, uh, my most memorable jacket. I shouldn't say it was my"
1747.84,1752.24," best because it was probably my worst. But my most memorable was actually going up to BioWare,"
1752.24,1756.16," where you guys went. Little while I go for Dragon Age. But I went up there for Baldur's Gate 2,"
1756.8000000000002,1763.6000000000001," back in the day. And I was, uh, let's see, I flew all day to get to Edmonton Edmonton where BioWare is located."
1763.6000000000001,1769.68," It was like the northernmost part of Canada, like the only thing more north of, is it's a major population"
1769.68,1774.24," center. Right. Right. Right. I mean, there's stuff there north of there, but it's like moose and ice."
1776.5600000000002,1782.0800000000002," But in, uh, so I was late when I got in there. And I hadn't had anything to eat. I went out with"
1782.1599999999999,1786.72," the BioWare guys. And they like bought me pints of Canadian beer, which if you don't know,"
1787.28,1794.0," it's like much more alcohol, uh, intensive than American beer. And we had like six pints of the stuff"
1795.12,1800.24, in no dinner. And then I went back to my room and promptly threw up all over my hotel bed.
1800.24,1807.1999999999998," And then, and then, and then basically fell asleep. And then it's a great story. That's good."
1807.1999999999998,1811.6799999999998," And then someone said, then, then, then, there was like this fall, like blackout period. And, uh,"
1811.76,1817.52," where I was passed out of sleep. And then the next, my next conscious moment was I could feel, like,"
1818.3200000000002,1824.4," my face was very, very cold. So I opened my eyes and then I saw like wood paneling. And then I,"
1824.4,1829.6000000000001, like fully open my eyes and I realized I was laying on the bathroom floor. So the cold was the
1829.6000000000001,1835.1200000000001," cold of the, uh, the, uh, well, no, you know, the bathroom floor. And the wood was the wood paneling of the"
1835.1200000000001,1840.72," sink. That's hard living there. Yeah. And then, uh, then a few hours later, I had to get up before the"
1840.8,1844.88," actual botherscaping to the story. The reason I was there. And, you know, at the time, I was like"
1844.88,1849.28," a associate editor, Johnny Wilson was my boss. It was like the cover story. I had to really work,"
1849.28,1854.72," you know, right? And I was so, I was in such bad shape. It was Lucienus. It was awful. I remember"
1854.72,1859.68," I was meeting Ray, uh, for the second time. I'd seen him once for shattered steel back in the day."
1859.68,1864.16, But I was sitting next to him at lunch. And he was talking to me very seriously about bioware
1864.16,1867.3600000000001," and their plans. And all I was thinking the entire time during the scene of he was,"
1867.4399999999998,1873.6799999999998," please don't throw up. Please don't throw up. No, no, no, no, no. That's my great story. Yeah."
1873.6799999999998,1877.84," Actually, from this last trip up there, I get to tell you this is insane invention. I thought this"
1877.84,1882.24," is one place called Julio's Barrio up there. And it's like a, it's like an alcohol slush puppy."
1882.24,1885.76, Julio's Barrio. That's nice. That's not too racist.
1885.76,1891.76," Did you hear me? I didn't make up the name of the place. Oh, by the way, was speedy guns all"
1891.84,1898.0," in the car. So you said, you're welcome. By the way, oh, my turn. There's also a monkey island bar there."
1898.0,1902.0," Oh, that's cool. So that was kind of cool. But anyway, so they have the strength. It's basically like a"
1902.0,1905.92," like a margarita glass full of like, you know, I slush whatever. And then they take the Canadian"
1905.92,1909.68, beers. And they put them in like a at an angle. So we kind of slowly drips into the into the glass.
1909.68,1915.36," And they pour in liquor. You'd bow. You jam a straw in and it tastes like, you know, like a"
1915.36,1920.0, like a shaker slushier or something. It's awesome. How they're like air and liquor together.
1920.0,1928.64, Sounds tasty. It's magical. We're getting like the wrap up sign. Is that because somebody else's podcast?
1928.64,1932.88," Yeah, we're supposed to be out of here. Pastards. Why? That's it. You know, something we're going to do is"
1932.88,1938.96," read our letters. Let's do letters. Let's just eat. Yeah, I'm coming on after us. I was going to"
1938.96,1943.68, just from the right. Those guys are anything. So I got them back to back. They're here. Yeah.
1945.04,1949.76, Okay. So some quick some straightaway trick letters. And then I have a comment on the after you read the
1949.76,1955.36, letters on the letter writers names. All right. There's a theme this week. Yeah. There's a theme.
1955.36,1963.36," Well, this first letter comes from crap allicious. Come at B. Jeff. Right on. That's my"
1963.36,1967.44," two. We're going to about me farting on the air. Oh, I'm getting a readers. This is this whole podcast."
1967.44,1971.68," Just taking a look at the call. Get feeds anyway. Okay. Go ahead. So crap, a little ask since you guys are"
1971.68,1976.96," bringing back reviews for GFW, are you guys going to be given out game of the year awards? If so,"
1976.96,1983.52," where did the different categories going to be? Well, first, why yes, yes, we are. Game of the"
1983.52,1989.28, years. We are doing a game of the awards in the March issue. I believe March. I think March
1989.28,1993.92, or A. And the reason for that is that because of our lead time that allows for us to get to the actual
1993.92,2001.52," end of the year. So any games released before January 1st will be eligible. And, you know, the categories."
2001.52,2005.2, They're the same. What they always are. But it's for us to reviews that we've always been there.
2005.2,2009.68," It's not like they left. It's just that we just started putting, well, yes. The scores are back. Yes."
2009.68,2012.72, And we're doing game of the year. People don't read the reviews. They just want the scores.
2013.28,2016.48," Well, they're both back. And what's the second question?"
2018.72,2022.8," Oh, he asks with a different categories. We're going to be. I mean, from the other guy. Oh, okay. We're"
2022.8,2029.92," back with grapple issues. So, Diary with later. Which is grapple issues, by the way. Diary with"
2029.92,2035.44," later asks, what time do you think a series should stop? For example, the Tomb Raider series."
2035.44,2042.24," For me, it should have stopped after the first one. So, I would say what the teams creative"
2042.24,2045.52," juices right. Yeah. Yeah. When it gets to the point, you're just putting a different coat of"
2045.52,2049.84, paint on the same damn game. It's time to just call it a day. Right. Because like Tomb Raider was
2049.84,2053.6, the first one was good. And then like legend was good. And then everything in between was not.
2053.6,2058.8," So like, was that because Toby guard left after the first game? Like one of the one of the creators"
2058.88,2063.6800000000003, is at the case. There's such a long complicated story. I know. It's a long long story.
2063.6800000000003,2067.28," You went on to make other games that weren't that good. Well, Gellian never happened. I mean,"
2067.28,2071.44," it took forever to get that thing going. I mean, that's really tough question, really."
2071.44,2076.96," I mean, Altoma made it through arguably seven good ones. That's like, do you not,"
2076.96,2081.36," did you not want another half life after half life won? You know, I mean, and do you still,"
2081.36,2086.32," and it's like, I mean, with that game, it's like, classic example. I think it speaks for games that"
2086.4,2091.2000000000003," make you want more. Because when you're playing it, it hints at enough things that makes you think"
2091.2000000000003,2096.48," about the world without, you know, just reams of exposition. It suggests certain things and leaves"
2096.48,2100.48," questions on answered so that when it comes back, it's going to do something to expand on those and"
2100.48,2105.2000000000003," work them out. You know, but if it's a case where it's just, hey, this is the game that we did before,"
2105.2000000000003,2109.6000000000004," you know, let's just do another one out. We'll just basically add some new maps to it, change"
2109.6000000000004,2113.84," scripting a little bit. I mean, that's so expansion. Personally, I couldn't get enough army men games."
2114.0,2120.0, Yeah. That's what we call a runner. I'm kidding. I think we don't have another Madden ever
2120.0,2126.4, quest now on 12 expansions. Yeah. I did it. It really depends. It depends on the execution of
2126.4,2130.7200000000003," the company. I mean, it's not a matter of like saying this series needs to die. It's a matter of,"
2130.7200000000003,2136.6400000000003," you know, is it like we said earlier, just as the creative juice that team gone. And also,"
2136.6400000000003,2140.4," yeah, yeah, I mean, it could basically happen to anyone. So it's like called it, you too,"
2140.48,2145.12, completely loved it. Playing called duty three now. Wow. I have so desire to play that.
2145.12,2150.96," Definitely like, okay, this is pretty much done. You know, but it's not. I mean, couldn't they really"
2150.96,2154.8," come back with a call? They could. Yeah, that's what it just depends on the product. You know, I mean,"
2154.8,2159.76," they can each game, each game sequel has the potential, the very real potential to convince you."
2159.76,2164.4," I mean, if you're a nice air to convince you that, yes, this was definitely worth your worth the work."
2164.4,2169.6800000000003," You know, yeah. But then, and conversely, it can also make you think, okay, why do they do this?"
2169.6800000000003,2175.28," You know, why is this game still coming out every year? Instead of, you know, whatever, taking a two-year"
2175.28,2181.36," gap between three-year gap, whatever the case may be. I, I had felt back in in Tomb Raiders heyday."
2181.36,2186.2400000000002," I was really frustrated when they started kind of crap in those games acts. I felt like they just,"
2186.2400000000002,2191.6," if they just relaxed took a little more time between releases, it's one of these could be a big deal."
2191.7599999999998,2196.64, The way Half-Life is. They just like squandered the good well of that series. Yeah.
2197.68,2202.48," Yeah, the sequel could have been huge. I mean, in two was, you know, it was pretty well received."
2202.48,2207.68," The three was by the time people just said, okay. Yeah, that's enough. We're on the treadmill this one."
2210.08,2215.12," So, are we done? Yeah, let me, I, I, throughout one last bit, it news that because I might actually"
2215.12,2222.3199999999997," beat the internet on this one, Half-Life 2 episode 2, Team Fortress 2 and Portal, the package that's"
2222.3199999999997,2228.3199999999997," was slated to come out and just spring. It's now been pushed back to late summer. What? So, uh,"
2228.3199999999997,2232.24," Valve is late. That's a, yeah, that's a whole other discussion on what that means for"
2232.24,2236.7999999999997," episodic content, and especially when the episodes come out at 14 month intervals are more,"
2237.3599999999997,2243.04," but for what it's worth, yeah, you can, however, that changes your multiplayer gaming plans for"
2243.68,2250.08," for the beginning of the coming year. Yeah, kind of sucks for the, uh, the episodic thing,"
2250.08,2255.84," but in terms of, I don't know, I'm always a fan of like weight and get it right, rather than crap."
2255.84,2259.6," Yeah, it's hard to argue with that, but I think it's probably that the episodic thing makes it seem"
2259.6,2265.12," even longer, and it might have, like, you know, sin, one episode came out. We, you know, we can't"
2265.12,2268.32," find out anything else about it. Yeah, what's that? I know that they're working on something,"
2268.32,2273.28," you know, when I last spoke to, uh, the stain over there. And, you know, in that and with half"
2273.28,2278.8," life and these big gaps, it's really, I mean, you know, how strong are the role models to say that"
2278.8,2282.6400000000003, episodic is really working. This is the thing. It's kind of making me think that maybe what you're
2282.6400000000003,2288.0800000000004," going to see more of is like what Epic's clearly doing with Gears of War on 360 is that make this game,"
2288.0800000000004,2291.6800000000003," and then make a whole bunch of extra content. Basically, the expansion pack model that we've all"
2291.6800000000003,2297.52," been used to, but even make them smaller than expansion packs. And, you know, uh, what happened with"
2297.6,2301.52," the Bolivian and stuff? I mean, it almost seems like that's probably going to be the way things go."
2301.52,2306.56," At least if, I mean, unless someone makes a breakthrough, because, I mean, half life is an episode,"
2306.56,2309.7599999999998," everyone's going to buy it, you know, and that's almost its own thing, but you got to look more"
2309.7599999999998,2312.96," toward, I think, games like sin and stuff, and it'll be interesting to see what happens with salmon"
2312.96,2317.2," macks, but yeah, what's the part in macks? I can't. So I think they're saying it's starting,"
2317.2,2321.44," there's a little bit of a gap because they're looking at just polished some stuff, and the first one"
2321.44,2326.16," launches December, I mean, right though, the next one launches December, and then after that, they're saying"
2326.24,2332.8799999999997," it's going to be monthly after that. Okay. So on that note, on that note, away hang on, don't you have"
2332.8799999999997,2337.8399999999997," a comment for crap malicious scenarios? Oh, yeah, I think they comment, you know, my mom, I want my"
2337.8399999999997,2342.56," mom, no one's in this podcast. Why do you choose to read their letters then? Why do you do it?"
2342.56,2347.3599999999997," Well, they ask a questions. We can use their different names. Okay, I'm not sure if this"
2347.3599999999997,2354.24," blighters now can be DS and crap malicious. And if you guys will call that off of our message,"
2354.7999999999997,2359.2799999999997," circle kit. Here's another protein on our message board. If you click their username, it'll take you to their page."
2359.2799999999997,2364.9599999999996," And in most cases, you'll see their real name listed on the left. Yeah, yeah, go. That's what I've been doing. Wow,"
2364.9599999999996,2370.8799999999997," you're good at the internet. In tar web. Okay. Well, we're so we're off now for the holidays."
2370.8799999999997,2377.52," Hooray. Everybody have a good break. And we're actually, I think we're back next Monday. Are we all in the same place at the same time?"
2378.24,2382.24, Should be. Should be. All right. We know we let you folks down occasionally with our late
2382.24,2394.08," messing with sorry, but we should be back next week. Okay, we'll see you around. Bye. Bye."
