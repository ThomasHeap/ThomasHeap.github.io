106.96,107.96, No.
107.96,108.96, No.
108.96,112.72, I came out and so Calbert was a great gift in one of my friends got me because I already got
112.72,114.19999999999999, the good stuff.
114.19999999999999,116.19999999999999, He got me.
116.19999999999999,117.19999999999999, I don't even remember.
117.19999999999999,118.44, That's how much I love the game.
118.44,120.52, It was like an airborne racing game.
120.52,122.17999999999999, To sell it right away.
122.17999999999999,123.17999999999999, We traded it.
123.17999999999999,124.17999999999999, Yeah.
124.17999999999999,125.17999999999999, Well.
125.17999999999999,126.17999999999999, But that takes me back.
126.17999999999999,129.42, That was one of my first times when I remember the whole pre-order shit was
129.42,130.92, starting to blow up.
130.92,132.72, And there's a phone call and a street.
132.72,134.2, I don't know if it was existing anymore.
134.2,135.48, It's now game-stop exist.
135.48,136.48, I may be the game-stop now.
136.48,137.48," Oh, the air."
137.48,138.92, everything's game stuff.
138.92,143.56, And we went there and those dudes were telling us like you have to pre-order this if you want to get it.
143.56,148.92," You got to do it and then there's like, we actually believe there's like a big K in the same parking lot."
148.92,152.04," We walked over there and I was like, all right, we got it. Let's just go my friends."
152.04,154.04," Like, no, we got to go back and show it to those guys."
154.04,157.64," Runs in the door. Like, there's a fucking dance by the counter wave and things."
157.64,160.12," Oh, my god, the door."
161.07999999999998,162.83999999999997, There's tons of them over K-mart.
163.72,167.96, We're to think there'd be a pre-order thing at all for anything Dreamcast.
167.96,170.68, So you could basically buy Dreamcast for like $5 now.
170.68,171.96," No, it is. Yeah."
171.96,174.2, But it was hot. That was an awesome console.
174.2,175.56," Love that, I love that one."
175.56,177.56, Still got mine. So much fun.
178.28,183.16, I bought mine actually. I was sort of like the the people way that the iPhone people got screwed last week.
183.16,188.2, I was one of those guys about the Dreamcast for full price like the day before it went down to like nothing.
188.2,189.08," Oh, wow."
189.08,189.48000000000002, Yeah.
189.48000000000002,190.68, There's a lot of hoops.
190.76000000000002,195.56, My version of the Dreamcast game was that wasn't the air when EBE games let give you the
196.76000000000002,201.08," the return generous return policy that said if you, you know, says faction guaranteed."
201.08,202.92000000000002," If you don't like it 10 days, bring it back."
202.92000000000002,207.8, And so what I did was I got jet jet was a jet grinder.
207.8,208.20000000000002, Radio.
208.20000000000002,208.92000000000002, Yeah.
208.92000000000002,209.4, Yeah.
209.4,210.12, Got that.
210.12,210.76000000000002, Solved it.
210.76000000000002,211.48000000000002, Took it back.
211.48000000000002,212.68, And then I got Shenmue.
212.68,214.92000000000002, Solved that in like two days.
214.92000000000002,215.8, Took that back.
216.12,217.4, Then I got Shenmue.
217.4,217.96, Yeah.
217.96,218.68, I totally did.
218.68,218.92000000000002, They do.
218.92000000000002,219.64000000000001," Oh, wow."
219.72,221.0, I really loved it too.
221.0,222.51999999999998, It's a lot of serene to it.
222.51999999999998,226.76, I'm ever telling everyone in grad school about like how promising it was for the future.
226.76,227.72, Interactive media.
229.88,230.44, Basically.
230.44,233.72, So you were talking shit way back then to say you were a way.
233.72,234.04, Right.
234.04,234.35999999999999, Side.
234.35999999999999,236.6, They do play lucky professional career in talking shit.
236.6,240.35999999999999, But then know it then that string of of swaps continued until like I bought him
240.35999999999999,241.64, down on a few really bad ones.
241.64,243.95999999999998, Like he was two one of the Tomb Raider ones that came out.
244.67999999999998,247.16, And then I took took that back immediately.
247.56,248.04, And then.
248.67999999999998,253.48," But yeah, I got I went through at least like six or seven games on that for that one 50 bucks."
253.48,256.12, If there's I think a lot of people do that for us.
256.12,257.0," I mean, I know I did too."
257.0,259.15999999999997, And like after a while they just said they actually changed the story.
259.15999999999997,261.48, I feel like they changed the story policy because people like us were just bulled that.
261.48,261.96, They did.
261.96,262.12, Yeah.
262.12,265.0, The receipt like was just getting a longer and longer with the kids.
265.0,265.48, Yeah.
265.48,266.68, I like trade-ins.
266.68,267.32, Next.
267.32,268.28, Hard to please me.
270.36,272.2, You started this game racket.
272.2,273.48, It's all your fault.
274.6,276.52, So yeah.
276.59999999999997,277.24, All right.
277.24,277.64, So here we are.
277.64,279.08," Well, we're in the detour then."
279.08,279.88, Yeah.
279.88,281.47999999999996, On Friday.
281.47999999999996,284.35999999999996, I went and played miniature golf with Bobby Dough.
284.35999999999996,285.64, That's Robert Ashley.
285.64,287.15999999999997, Sometimes on our podcast.
287.15999999999997,287.47999999999996, Uh-huh.
288.52,293.24," And you know, we went with our girlfriends and the Southern Guy Willis Lamburt came with us."
293.24,298.35999999999996," And so while the women were talking, we were just doing our usual like talking about games"
298.35999999999996,301.24," and around about way even though we said okay, no game talk."
301.24,302.28," Well, we're here."
302.28,304.59999999999997, And we did it anyway.
304.6,307.16," And so as we're playing, we just started talking about all this."
307.16,308.28000000000003," Well, it started out."
308.28000000000003,309.72, I was there asking why I was so good.
309.72,310.6," Oh, because I'm here."
310.6,313.0, I want to really brag about my mini golf skills right now.
313.0,314.6, And that's a little point of the point.
314.6,315.6, Yeah.
315.6,316.6, Is that the point of the story?
316.6,317.6, How awesome you are at me.
317.6,318.6," No, it's not."
318.6,319.6, Okay.
319.6,320.6, That'd be okay.
320.6,322.28000000000003, But I'm totally in the dirt there.
322.28000000000003,323.28000000000003, Even they were surprised.
323.28000000000003,324.8," They're like, how the hell did you know about this place?"
324.8,326.92, It's not the middle of nowhere out in Castro Valley.
326.92,329.56," Um, but it's like an awesome course."
329.56,332.24, They have just like really good technical holes.
333.2,336.2, So that's one of the things that they got weird contraptions and shit.
336.2,338.88," Yeah, but it's like sometimes like a gimmick isn't enough."
338.88,339.88," Like, you to good golf."
339.88,340.56, This came up to you.
340.56,340.88, May I?
340.88,341.88, We were like praising the good.
341.88,346.92," They're like, okay, the good golf hole is like, you know, an unreal level or something."
346.92,348.68, You start off with a geometry and figure it out.
348.68,350.32," Man, you big the build plywood."
350.32,350.92, You big the.
350.92,351.32, Sure.
353.32,354.64," Twenty boat, twenty boat, twenty boat."
354.64,357.56," You been, you build the big plywood pagoda."
357.56,358.32, Yes.
358.32,360.72," Around the whole afterward, the windmill with the things."
360.72,363.6," So yeah, just to give me can itself, this no good has to be fun."
363.6,367.28000000000003," So like a fun one there would be like a giant ski ball scenario and where, you know,"
367.28000000000003,370.08000000000004," the, the equivalent of the bull's eye is a hole in one and the other."
370.08000000000004,370.92," Yeah, it's like just a golf."
370.92,372.24, Golf land golf lane golden.
372.24,372.6, Okay.
372.6,373.96000000000004, I go to the one and sunny valley.
373.96000000000004,375.28000000000003," Yeah, it's be very similar."
375.28000000000003,376.12, That's a good.
376.28000000000003,377.6, That they have some good stuff there.
377.64000000000004,381.28000000000003," But so anyway, we're playing and then, um, I told the story now."
381.28000000000003,382.12, I'm going to back it up.
382.12,385.64000000000004," It's going to be recursive or like embedded, you know, stories within stories."
385.64000000000004,386.32000000000005, So wow.
386.32000000000005,386.56, Wow.
386.56,387.40000000000003, How meta of you?
387.40000000000003,390.28000000000003, We used to go to the west in grad school in Birch Bay.
390.44,392.47999999999996, Washington state up near the Canadian border.
392.47999999999996,395.55999999999995," We went to this like, she's a little mini golf place."
395.55999999999995,396.91999999999996, And it was like an old couple made it.
396.91999999999996,399.0, And it was inside of a shed.
399.67999999999995,402.67999999999995," And it basically went and described it to people would be like if there was a, um,"
402.67999999999995,406.44, a tornado and it ripped through a trailer park and just scooped up all kinds of shit and
406.44,410.84, brick a brick and then it like died out like the pressure levels like balanced out or
410.84,411.84, whatever.
411.84,412.32, And they just dropped all the shit.
412.32,415.84, It was holding and then some fool built four walls and a roof on it.
416.11999999999995,419.2, And then that was a golf course called carved out some holes for it.
419.2,420.56," Yeah, it was a golf course."
420.56,425.03999999999996," But then the thing that was particularly, there was funny about that other in the fact that"
425.03999999999996,428.12, the guy made you stick a thumbtack on the map when you came in and show where you're
428.12,431.2, from and spit your gum out and promise to him that you weren't going to ever raise the
431.2,437.12, club above your knee and all this other garbage was just random toys and just trash all
437.12,438.12, in this place.
438.12,442.32," You know, so we were saying, we're talking about a doc and doing a documentary on that guy."
442.32,446.56," And then we're like, we want to, we want to make a mini golf course that tells the story"
446.64,449.76, where every hole was part of this big narrative and then when you've done when you play
449.76,454.32," your way through the 18, like you've completed the story and then we just realized that"
454.32,455.32, that wasn't awesome.
455.32,456.32, So it's like an RPG.
456.32,459.88," It was just, you know, it was not some metaphor for video games."
459.88,460.88, Yeah.
460.88,462.88, So it was a linear 18 hole experience.
462.88,463.88," And then, yeah, right."
463.88,464.88, Have some emotional satisfaction.
464.88,468.36," It's all like the ball in the hall, but we got to find some way to tell a story."
468.36,470.08, So I'm going to make that game now.
470.08,471.08, Have some exciting moments.
471.08,472.08, I'm going to steal your idea.
472.08,474.32, Mario golf was a little bit like that.
474.96,479.48," And even like, I mean, at the end of the day, I know even by a shark is that."
479.48,481.04," Yeah, I mean, yeah."
482.08,482.71999999999997, I agree.
483.2,484.08, The ball in the hole.
484.52,484.71999999999997, True.
484.71999999999997,485.96, So that's why I brought up.
486.44,489.15999999999997," Oh, did I had a by a shock for the record, didn't I?"
489.84,490.84," Well, we're on that budget."
490.84,495.88," Oh, it's that somebody had a couple of people actually had written us to tell us that the,"
496.4,501.76," that you actually can get to a total auto hack on the turrets, right?"
501.76,503.56, It wasn't that the camera is now.
504.2,508.08," Once you fully research turrets and security bots with the camera, you get the auto hack on them."
508.08,508.6, Right.
508.6,511.28000000000003," It's no auto hack for security cameras, sadly."
511.28000000000003,516.68," And then same thing for Etreon Odyssey, they wanted to clarify that."
518.2,521.56," Says the poster, which you could press about and to sell all of a certain item."
521.56,522.88," That poster, of course, was a."
524.84,525.4, Sorry.
525.4,525.96, Sorry John.
525.96,526.36, Right.
527.32,528.6," And he says, well, you can."
528.6,532.88," I guess he missed the thing that says, why all, which means press, why to sell all the selected item."
533.56,535.04, So we need to be snarky.
535.04,535.3599999999999, Yeah.
535.3599999999999,538.4799999999999, So that's this segments for the record.
538.4799999999999,540.52," Yeah, that's part of the target of corrections."
540.52,541.3199999999999, All right.
541.3199999999999,543.64, Should we actually discuss a topic?
543.64,544.64, Let's do it.
544.64,545.5999999999999," Actually, the game plan."
545.5999999999999,546.8399999999999," Yeah, let's have a gameplay."
546.8399999999999,547.8399999999999, Do you have one?
547.8399999999999,548.8399999999999, We do have one.
548.8399999999999,554.28," Actually, one thing we can talk about, not entirely PC related, but we promise we have important"
554.28,556.68, big PC stuff coming up later in the podcast.
557.9599999999999,558.92, Somebody go find some.
559.88,561.9599999999999, We're somebody posted.
561.9599999999999,563.64," Actually, it was a website."
564.64,566.4799999999999, This has been making a rounds today.
566.4799999999999,569.52," And yesterday, the top 25 best selling video games of all time."
569.92,574.92," I don't know where this list first was posted, but the link was sent to me from"
574.92,576.52, gunslot.com.
576.92,578.64, This is actually like a gun site.
579.7199999999999,581.4799999999999, I had no idea what that had to do.
581.4799999999999,582.28, And authority.
582.28,582.68, Yeah.
582.68,584.4, That's your gaming authority.
584.4,586.4, Can you imagine MPD and then gunslaught?
586.4,587.4," Yeah, pretty much."
588.92,592.4799999999999, I don't know if anybody else wants to read these off or I can start or whatever.
592.88,599.0799999999999," You got your top 25 best selling video games of all time platform, regardless of platform."
599.8,601.7199999999999," If you guys all seen this list, I've seen it."
601.7199999999999,601.92, Yeah.
601.92,602.76, I do not know how you have.
602.76,604.4, So we can't play a game.
604.4,606.0799999999999, I can't say guess what number one is.
606.1999999999999,607.0799999999999, I didn't see no.
607.0799999999999,607.68, I would.
607.68,608.9599999999999, I can't even guess for a long.
608.9599999999999,611.92," Yeah, there's another thing to go with this list is that it counts."
612.4,613.56, So packing games.
613.56,617.76," So, you know, super Mario world, for example, or, you know, that because it comes"
617.76,619.3199999999999, with super Nintendo doesn't count.
619.3199999999999,620.3199999999999, It does count.
620.3199999999999,621.3199999999999," No, it doesn't count."
621.3199999999999,624.16," It just tells the console sales with, this says represents independent sales of"
624.16,625.16, packet.
625.16,627.16," Oh, you're right."
627.16,630.72," Yes, so it says, for example, packaged with Nintendo's Super Mario Bros."
630.72,632.12, sold 40 million copies.
633.24,634.8, The list includes international sales.
635.4,636.8, So is that that's on the list then?
637.08,640.4399999999999, So I'm guessing not actually it isn't because the highest one is 20 million.
640.4399999999999,641.24," So now, okay."
641.24,643.08," They're not, they're not including games."
643.08,644.24, Pettled with systems.
644.24,645.24, Very wide.
645.24,646.36, What if gunslaught or whoever did this?
646.36,648.44, So what would you have guess was the number one selling game at
648.44,649.44, the time?
649.44,650.44, I would have guessed Super Mario Bros.
650.44,651.44, 3.
651.44,652.8000000000001, And that was number two.
652.8000000000001,653.8000000000001, Right.
653.8000000000001,654.8000000000001, Number one.
654.8000000000001,656.6," I mean, it's not early of cheat."
656.6,657.6, Is it?
657.6,658.6, It's Pokemon Red Blue and Green.
658.6,661.84," That is one game, right, even though their packets separately."
661.84,662.84, Sure.
662.84,664.48, Some people brought bottom multiple versions.
664.48,666.44," Yeah, which is why it's number one."
666.44,667.44, Right.
667.44,670.44, 20.08 million of Pokemon Red Blue and Green.
670.44,672.64," Number two, Super Mario Bros."
672.64,674.52, 3 for the NES.
674.52,677.52," Number three, PC."
677.52,679.28, What do you think of that?
679.28,681.0, Sims 1 or 2.
681.0,682.4," Yeah, it's only one."
682.4,683.4, It Sims 1.
683.4,686.52," Yeah, Sims 2 is also on the list further down."
686.52,691.4399999999999," But yeah, the Sims at number three with 16 million copies sold."
691.4399999999999,693.96," So that's after two Nintendo games, the PC."
693.96,694.96, Huh?
694.96,696.8, What do you think about that there?
696.8,699.1999999999999, We beat the PlayStation N Xbox.
699.1999999999999,701.3199999999999," Yeah, fucking guys."
701.32,705.44," And also, the whole list is like handheld dominated."
705.44,706.44," Yeah, kind of is."
706.44,707.44, That's interesting.
707.44,711.0400000000001, It actually really kind of boils down to like four franchises.
711.0400000000001,713.7600000000001," You know, like Pokemon Mario."
713.7600000000001,714.7600000000001, Yeah.
714.7600000000001,717.5600000000001, Number four actually surprised the hell out of me.
717.5600000000001,724.44," After the Sims at 16 million, next is Nintendox at 14.75 million for the deal."
724.44,726.8000000000001, I knew it was.
726.8000000000001,728.0, I knew it did great.
728.0,729.72, I'm not surprised that it's on that list.
729.72,731.52, I'm surprised it's as high as it is.
731.52,732.52, Exactly.
732.52,733.52, Yeah.
733.52,734.52, Very good.
734.52,737.48, Then we got another Pokemon at number five Pokemon Golden Silver.
737.48,738.72, And already this little faster.
738.72,740.96, Six Super Mario Land.
740.96,741.96, That's a game boy.
741.96,742.96, I miss that game.
742.96,743.96, And that was like portable.
743.96,744.96, That game was game boy.
744.96,747.96, I'll just go ahead and say that game was pretty terrible.
747.96,748.96, Okay.
748.96,749.96, I'll take it.
749.96,750.96, I'll take it.
750.96,751.96, No fanboys out there.
751.96,758.6800000000001, 7GTA Vice City in a tie with another Pokemon Pokemon Ruby in Sapphire.
758.92,762.76, Three Pokemon in the top seven for those counting.
762.76,764.9599999999999, Then we have Sims 2.
764.9599999999999,765.9599999999999, Also very high up.
765.9599999999999,766.9599999999999, That Sims 2.
766.9599999999999,767.9599999999999, That Sims 2.
767.9599999999999,772.9599999999999," Three way tie between GTA Vice City, Pokemon Ruby in Sapphire and Sims 2."
772.9599999999999,775.0799999999999, So is the GTA one all platforms?
775.0799999999999,776.0799999999999, Or is it counting on you?
776.0799999999999,777.0799999999999, Just a one.
777.0799999999999,778.0799999999999, PS2.
778.0799999999999,779.0799999999999, Okay.
779.0799999999999,781.4399999999999, And that's 13 million for all those.
781.4399999999999,785.5999999999999, Then we've got GTA San Andreas.
785.6,792.96," 12 million Super Mario 64, 11 million grandfrees, more three for PlayStation 2, 11 million,"
792.96,797.52," GTA 3, the original for PlayStation 2, at 11 million."
797.52,805.36," Another Pokemon, Fire Red and Leaf Green at 10.66 million, new Super Mario brothers on for"
805.36,806.36, the DS.
806.36,807.6800000000001, That's pretty high.
807.6800000000001,808.6800000000001, 10.32 million.
808.6800000000001,811.36, I knew that one's all a lot though.
811.36,813.24, Grandtrees 1 for PS1.
813.24,814.24, That's kind of nice.
814.32,815.24, That's kind of nice.
815.24,816.24, A lot of repeats.
816.24,817.44, It just keeps like cycling over and over again.
817.44,818.44, Yeah.
818.44,819.44," I mean, it's like the same franchise."
819.44,820.44, This here.
820.44,821.44, GTA is all of the place Pokemon.
821.44,822.44, The Super Mario Brothers.
822.44,823.44, Okay.
823.44,824.44, Here we go again.
824.44,829.44, 17 is Pokemon Diamond and Pearl tied with Super Mario Brothers 2.
829.44,831.24, Those are 10 million each.
831.24,833.44, Then find a fantasy 7.
833.44,834.44, 19.
834.44,837.44," Finally, we get another PC game at number 20."
837.44,840.84, This is the first one since Sims 1 and 2.
840.84,841.84, Any guesses?
841.84,842.84, We're going to work here.
842.84,843.84, No.
843.84,844.84, Starcraft.
844.84,846.24, Nancy Drew.
846.24,847.24, We have a winner.
847.24,848.64," No, it is Starcraft."
848.64,849.64, Yeah.
849.64,851.0400000000001, Starcraft at 9.5 million.
851.0400000000001,852.36," So, look, long enough."
852.36,855.36, The next one down is World Warcraft at 9 million.
855.36,857.9200000000001, But I find that number suspect.
857.9200000000001,858.9200000000001, You find that suspect?
858.9200000000001,861.1600000000001, I do because that's the number of subscribers they have.
861.1600000000001,864.24, It's doesn't necessarily mean the number of copies sold.
864.24,865.44, I don't know.
865.44,866.44, That one made me go.
866.44,867.44, Huh.
867.44,868.44, Really?
868.44,869.44, I don't know.
869.44,870.44, Hmm.
870.44,871.44, Are you calling this entire list into question?
871.44,872.44, Maybe I am.
872.44,873.44, That's where it gets tricky.
874.0400000000001,876.84," But anyway, so Starcraft and Warcraft are one after another."
876.84,877.84, They're at 20 and 20.
877.84,879.24, The other thing to this is.
879.24,880.0400000000001, All retail sales.
880.0400000000001,883.6," This is, yeah, the sales games, the list of blowworkers and independent sales of package"
883.6,884.6, games.
884.6,885.6, Yeah.
885.6,887.84," So, you're back to the whole list of these."
887.84,888.84, The whole list of these.
888.84,892.6800000000001," The thing that PC people always do is that, well, you're not counting this in that."
892.6800000000001,893.6800000000001, Right.
893.6800000000001,894.6800000000001, Right.
894.6800000000001,895.6800000000001, Then we are brain age.
895.6800000000001,897.2, 8.61 million.
897.2,899.12, That one surprised me.
899.12,900.32, That one surprised me.
900.32,903.4000000000001, I would have thought that would have been higher than 10 dogs for the yes.
903.64,907.72, Then a grand treat small two for PS1 and Mario Kart 64.
907.72,908.72, Halo 2.
909.72,910.24, I was wondering.
910.24,913.4399999999999, Coming in at 25 tied with donkey con country.
914.64,915.76, Did you con country?
915.76,916.76, What?
916.76,919.04, Did you have an appring out the comments?
919.04,920.4399999999999, I did print out the comments.
920.4399999999999,921.56, And I'm glad you said that.
921.56,922.88, Because I was a big fan of the comments.
922.88,924.9599999999999," Why is there glazing over like the, the list?"
924.9599999999999,925.8," Yeah, I can see it."
925.8,927.0, Just like the Lou Dobbina.
927.0,927.6, It's out there.
927.6,927.8, Yeah.
927.8,928.0, Yeah.
928.0,929.1999999999999," To like the, yeah."
929.1999999999999,931.56," Not bad to the dude that commented like,"
931.7199999999999,932.88, Buck Hail to it sucks.
932.88,933.68, You fucking punch.
933.68,934.1199999999999, Yeah.
934.1199999999999,934.76, That's a quote.
934.76,936.5999999999999, I'm not really glad that you noticed that.
936.5999999999999,937.4399999999999, Take a bite.
937.4399999999999,939.28, I printed out the comments.
939.28,940.4, Because it made me feel good.
940.4,941.88," Because it was like, OK."
941.88,943.4, This is actually a gun site.
943.4,944.68, It's not a gaming site.
944.68,944.88, Yeah.
944.88,947.52, And these guys have their forms are shitty as hard.
949.52,950.28, Let's say I'm gun.
950.28,951.0, You're going to watch them.
951.0,951.28, Exactly.
951.28,951.88, They have guns.
951.88,952.0799999999999, Right.
952.0799999999999,954.1199999999999," But they're, they're about as intelligent."
954.1199999999999,955.1199999999999, Let's see.
956.1199999999999,956.8399999999999," Oh, shit."
956.8399999999999,958.1199999999999, Where's the first page?
958.1199999999999,959.1199999999999, Hold on.
959.1199999999999,960.64, I'm the floor there on the floor.
960.64,961.0799999999999, Is that it?
961.1600000000001,961.9200000000001, OK.
961.9200000000001,962.76, Yeah.
962.76,964.08, So the whole thing starts out in their forum.
964.08,965.9200000000001," Oh, here was the rest of the tie."
965.9200000000001,967.96, So the tie for 25 was Halo 2.
967.96,971.5600000000001," Donkey Kong Country Super Mario Kart, Golden Eye,"
971.5600000000001,973.2, and Pokemon Yellow.
973.2,974.2," Oh, I forgot."
974.2,975.0, 25.
975.0,976.32, So take that Halo fans.
976.32,977.1600000000001, You know what said though?
977.1600000000001,979.12, It started a huge for all these guns.
979.12,982.2800000000001, That's it started a huge debate over why Half-Life was
982.2800000000001,982.88, in on there.
982.88,983.24, Yeah.
983.24,985.1600000000001, And how much better it is than Halo.
985.1600000000001,986.1600000000001, Right.
986.1600000000001,987.1600000000001, Yeah.
987.1600000000001,989.72," Actually, we could get to that part of their forum is,"
990.28,992.08," yeah, the conversations I'll over the place,"
992.08,993.36," but at one point it's,"
993.36,995.48, what are you retarded?
995.48,996.32, Halo is garbage.
996.32,997.64, Don't even get me started.
997.64,1000.52," You want a real FPS, get Half-Life and shut the fuck up."
1000.52,1001.64, Ha ha ha ha.
1001.64,1002.64, Ha ha ha.
1002.64,1002.84, Yeah.
1002.84,1003.64, Yeah.
1003.64,1004.52, And what is that?
1004.52,1005.0, Wow.
1005.0,1005.84, What is that?
1005.84,1008.36, This chart was chart of sales.
1008.36,1008.64, Right.
1008.64,1010.32," And then, then that goes on."
1010.32,1010.6800000000001, Let's see.
1010.6800000000001,1012.2, There's something about GALO.
1012.2,1014.52, Someone turns it into that.
1014.52,1016.0, That's just like forever.
1016.0,1017.2, Forever.
1017.2,1019.2, Like the HWG.
1019.2,1022.44," Well, you're looking, I'm shocked and kind of only,"
1022.44,1022.96," oh, yeah."
1022.96,1025.0, Only retards play GALO.
1025.0,1025.8, That was the post.
1025.8,1027.28, That's true.
1027.28,1030.16," And then after that, the response to that is only"
1030.16,1031.8, Fags call Halo GALO.
1031.8,1034.0, Ha ha ha ha ha.
1034.0,1035.44, Ha ha ha ha.
1035.44,1039.28, So it's pretty much your typical internet discourse.
1039.28,1040.28, Yeah.
1040.28,1042.8," But yeah, so right under the initial threat,"
1042.8,1046.56, it starts off with your supposed to list the number one
1046.56,1048.16, bestselling last.
1048.16,1050.3200000000002, Because they went one to 10 to 25.
1050.3200000000002,1051.3200000000002, So the guy didn't like that.
1051.3200000000002,1052.3200000000002, That's the first comment.
1052.3200000000002,1053.44, Like your personal next one.
1053.44,1055.8400000000001, You were supposed to let other people run their own website
1055.8400000000001,1056.3200000000002, idiots.
1056.3200000000002,1057.64, What if you never see the internet?
1057.64,1060.24," No, you are not spastic after that."
1060.24,1062.96, I can't wait to see the debate team on this one.
1062.96,1065.3200000000002, What you're doing idiots.
1065.3200000000002,1069.0400000000002, I'm glad that no deer hunting game showed up.
1069.0400000000002,1070.0, That's a prize.
1070.0,1072.8000000000002, What about your search and for that Jeff?
1072.8000000000002,1074.44, I've got a similar instance.
1074.44,1076.8000000000002, What if that sort of discourse is rather than
1076.8,1081.28, coming from just the back and forth is coming from the
1081.28,1085.28," official representatives of creative, the sound card"
1085.28,1088.6," maker who's I'm going to get a tension for this too,"
1088.6,1091.9199999999998, since I troll on our own boards all the time and get people
1091.9199999999998,1092.44, say the same.
1092.44,1094.96, You're supposed to be the official representative
1094.96,1095.56, winner.
1095.56,1095.76, Yeah.
1095.76,1096.56, You're on your troll.
1096.56,1098.56, Because I have this bad habit we call it troll night.
1098.56,1103.1599999999999," We're like, we just go out and troll our own board."
1103.1599999999999,1104.36, I just covered the door.
1104.36,1105.12, That was great.
1105.12,1108.4799999999998, I discovered that there was a I was a reading one up and
1108.4799999999998,1110.28," that was some guy posted on there and I'm like,"
1110.28,1111.76, who the fuck is this guy?
1111.76,1112.28, I'm not sure.
1112.28,1115.28, I'm wanting to respond and then I fan that it was you.
1115.28,1117.1599999999999, Ryan's all no no don't spoil.
1117.1599999999999,1118.36, I'm not going to say who.
1118.36,1119.8, I haven't all the count.
1119.8,1120.9599999999998," Yeah, that's made."
1120.9599999999998,1121.9599999999998," Yeah, there's a troll."
1121.9599999999998,1122.4799999999998, It's made.
1122.4799999999998,1122.9599999999998, Sean Elliott.
1122.9599999999998,1123.9599999999998, But he's not that.
1123.9599999999998,1125.12, That account is a mole.
1125.12,1129.1599999999999, That account is made to like parody like the worst
1129.1599999999999,1129.6799999999998, element.
1129.6799999999998,1131.9199999999998, It's really good that we have on our boards.
1131.9199999999998,1132.6, You would not know.
1132.6,1134.6399999999999," No, I mean, some people know, but most people don't"
1134.64,1138.0800000000002, even notice it was the most ludicrous fucking thing in the world.
1138.0800000000002,1140.68, And they just keep on going like right after nothing happened.
1140.68,1141.48," Oh, yeah."
1141.48,1143.2800000000002," And they'll just, you start a threat."
1143.2800000000002,1144.6000000000001, And just keep going.
1144.6000000000001,1147.0800000000002," But you know, other product of troll night was the,"
1147.0800000000002,1148.3600000000001, which I'm very proud of.
1148.3600000000001,1149.8000000000002, And we can now we can.
1149.8000000000002,1153.2," We can resuscitate it in our GFW thread was the,"
1153.2,1156.5600000000002, all halo three vehicles and weapons revealed.
1156.5600000000002,1160.0, And basically a bunch of human vehicles.
1160.0,1162.0, It looked like the pictures of those and did write up
1162.0,1166.64," some, me and Roy made it made all these write ups about how"
1166.64,1167.28, rad they were.
1167.28,1171.04, It's just got people mad.
1171.04,1173.0, It was actually a moment when the turtle's pizza
1173.0,1173.4, throw it.
1173.4,1173.84, That was.
1173.84,1174.84, That was what it was.
1174.84,1176.04, That was what it was.
1176.04,1177.92," OK, here's my favorite part of that forum."
1177.92,1179.12, Head didn't even get the creative.
1179.12,1180.12, We'll take it that afterward.
1180.12,1180.6, OK.
1180.6,1182.84," And now let me just get, then we'll be done with this."
1182.84,1185.28," My favorite part was one guy saying, somebody"
1185.28,1187.8, distant in 10 dogs and then the responses.
1187.8,1189.76," Then 10 dogs rules, Fag."
1189.76,1196.8," And then the response back was was the guy who he, who was called Fag."
1196.8,1198.44, So it says 10 dogs rule the Fag.
1198.44,1203.0," The guy replied back, then 10 dogs rules slash Fag."
1203.0,1203.64, Correct.
1203.64,1208.2," No, he corrected him as to say, then 10 dogs rules."
1208.2,1210.0, And then the 10 dogs rules signed Fag.
1210.0,1212.0, That's nice.
1212.0,1212.8," No, anyway."
1212.8,1213.48," Oh, man."
1213.48,1214.76," Yeah, that's good stuff."
1214.76,1216.56," So intelligent, just creative."
1216.56,1219.9199999999998," This negative woods, I have this because something"
1219.9199999999998,1222.72, awful for a member screencapped it before they were removed
1222.72,1224.0, later on.
1224.0,1226.52, But I don't know if this is indicative of creative customer
1226.52,1229.72, service in general or they had a rogue employee.
1229.72,1234.0," But basically, people were posting in their forums on their"
1234.0,1236.8, help and complaint forums over something that I can relate to
1236.8,1240.08," because when I got this, I had the exact same problem."
1240.08,1242.8," It just, the microphone, as I couldn't get it to work."
1242.8,1245.08, And all sorts of buggy sound issues and stuff
1245.08,1248.8799999999999, with my X-Fycard just does not like this.
1248.8799999999999,1250.8799999999999, So people had the same issues.
1250.8799999999999,1253.8," Ultimately, what I had to do to fix it was, I guess there's"
1253.8,1255.1599999999999," apparently they don't speak English either,"
1255.1599999999999,1258.6, but a couple guys cracked their own solution to it.
1258.6,1259.6399999999999, And that's what I downloaded.
1259.6399999999999,1261.24, And that was the only thing that worked.
1261.24,1262.0, OK.
1262.0,1262.6399999999999, Yeah.
1262.6399999999999,1265.48," So any member term, I was off the same podcast."
1265.48,1266.32, You mentioned a while ago.
1266.32,1267.6799999999998, It was one of our readers actually.
1267.6799999999998,1268.8799999999999," Yeah, I pointed me to it."
1268.8799999999999,1269.08, Yeah.
1269.08,1270.32," So yeah, thanks to him again."
1270.32,1270.52, OK.
1270.52,1274.04," I'm able to, I was able to record those skits that did a"
1274.04,1277.24, piano on our show because I have my sound thing working.
1277.24,1280.52, But so here's the post from the creative guy.
1280.52,1282.96," He says, getting tired of these posts,"
1282.96,1285.3999999999999, here's a few things to clarify the situation.
1285.3999999999999,1287.76," One, the drivers will be released more"
1287.76,1289.76, or good and ready and happy with them.
1289.76,1292.28," Two, bitching like a five-year-old won't magically"
1292.28,1294.6399999999999, solve all of your problems on the drivers.
1294.6399999999999,1297.76," Three, call us hopeless or whatever else all you like."
1297.76,1300.0," No one else is going to fix these drivers, but us."
1300.0,1302.28, Do more-alizing us won't bring it faster.
1302.28,1303.12, Four.
1303.1999999999998,1304.9199999999998, They're already reasonably working drivers
1304.9199999999998,1305.84, supplied with the card.
1305.84,1307.8," Legally, I responsibly stop there."
1307.8,1308.8," Oh, no."
1308.8,1309.8," Oh, no."
1309.8,1310.8," Oh, that's true."
1310.8,1313.8, Consider yourselves lucky that we even bother updating
1313.8,1314.3999999999999, the drivers.
1314.3999999999999,1315.3999999999999, Wow.
1315.3999999999999,1316.3999999999999, Wow.
1316.3999999999999,1318.04, This guy's still in the job.
1318.04,1319.04, I have no jobs.
1319.04,1319.52, Five.
1319.52,1321.6399999999999," Any more of these derogatory posts, and we might"
1321.6399999999999,1324.4399999999998, well just flush the whole X5 Vista 64-Saga
1324.4399999999998,1327.0, to the toilet and move on.
1327.0,1328.6," Yeah, that's nice."
1328.6,1331.1999999999998, That's what the customer is always wrong.
1331.1999999999998,1332.1999999999998," Great, it was."
1332.2,1335.68, What happened to the bunch of people come back with various
1335.68,1337.52," insults, including cons, fuck you,"
1337.52,1339.32," faggot's the usual stuff on the internet,"
1339.32,1341.8," the great, you know, wonderful language."
1341.8,1345.8400000000001," And then the X5, the creative guy"
1345.8400000000001,1351.6000000000001," comes back on to respond, and he says, wait."
1351.6000000000001,1352.44, Maybe.
1352.44,1352.96, OK.
1352.96,1357.04," I'd like someone to like my ass, smiley face,"
1357.04,1360.28," emoticon, hey, ma, look at the redneck."
1360.28,1362.56," Nice, too, and try blowing it out your ass."
1362.56,1363.24, Are you serious?
1363.24,1364.08, This is a community.
1364.08,1365.08, It's just like nice.
1365.08,1366.84, How about you suck the nuts out of my sack?
1366.84,1367.68, You son of a bitch.
1367.68,1370.08, Oh my god.
1370.08,1372.6399999999999," A big fuck you back, buddy."
1372.6399999999999,1373.44, Wow.
1373.44,1374.6399999999999, Whoa.
1374.6399999999999,1375.6399999999999, So we got to scream.
1375.6399999999999,1376.6, They haven't had a bad.
1376.6,1377.96," So unfortunately, you know,"
1377.96,1379.32," screen captain, all for posterity."
1379.32,1381.32," Oh, it was for me."
1381.32,1382.72," Yeah, someone tells me that guy's gone."
1382.72,1385.28, But that's a seriously next gen customer service.
1385.28,1388.16," Yeah, that's the right word."
1388.16,1389.28, I'm going to take home my buddy over there.
1389.28,1390.28, I'll find out what the deal is with you.
1390.28,1392.48," It's a great, great thing to see it like at a restaurant."
1392.48,1395.24, I think you have a shit if your steak is raw.
1395.24,1396.24, You're lucky.
1396.24,1397.24," You got it at all, bitch."
1397.24,1398.84, There's been plenty of versions of that.
1398.84,1400.8799999999999," I think it's like, like, should be hell show."
1400.8799999999999,1401.48, I think did it.
1401.48,1402.8799999999999," The copy center, whatever."
1402.8799999999999,1403.8799999999999, Is that?
1403.8799999999999,1406.52," I mean, it's just everyone's dream is basically working"
1406.52,1408.52, something like kind of like customer service environment.
1408.52,1411.92, And then the like the five minutes you have between when you quit and
1411.92,1413.92, when you had to out of the facility.
1413.92,1414.92, Perfect.
1414.92,1415.92, It's a good hard wild.
1415.92,1416.92, Right.
1416.92,1418.32, I did that in various forms.
1418.32,1421.84," You know, even out come back and help them out."
1421.84,1422.84, Yeah.
1422.84,1424.84, But that's horrible.
1424.84,1427.24," That's, yeah, let's just assume that."
1427.24,1429.84, We're going to assume that wasn't official creative labs.
1429.84,1431.08, Corporate policy.
1431.08,1433.08, I'm going to try.
1433.08,1434.48, Say this is one rogue.
1434.48,1437.12," You have to, I wonder how often this happens though in the business"
1437.12,1439.84, because when that's your job to sit there and listen to bitching and
1439.84,1441.4399999999998, moaning fucking grumbling people.
1441.4399999999998,1442.4399999999998, Yeah.
1442.4399999999998,1444.04," Well, listen to be honest on our own website."
1444.04,1446.3999999999999, We've had to put the Kabash on occasional.
1446.3999999999999,1447.3999999999999, Yeah.
1447.96,1450.1200000000001," Managers are a community manager, whoever."
1450.1200000000001,1453.0400000000002, I'm not community managers because there's only one of those.
1453.0400000000002,1453.8400000000001, Mods.
1453.8400000000001,1454.52," Uh, yeah."
1454.52,1457.64," The moderators are admins who will say something or like,"
1457.64,1459.48," eh, actually yet now don't."
1460.68,1463.4, That happened on the like official law boards.
1463.4,1464.64," There was one, I can't remember."
1464.64,1465.16, Yeah.
1465.16,1469.5600000000002, There's one particular community manager who is like the thread that broke
1469.5600000000002,1470.64, the camel's back pretty much.
1470.64,1474.68," Honestly, an exchange back and forth between the people who were"
1474.68,1478.8," trolling and then he him just posting like the weirdest, like most"
1478.8,1480.5600000000002, defensive things and then suddenly he was gone.
1480.5600000000002,1483.52," Just yeah, he just got an ad on that being your dude."
1483.52,1485.96," Maybe that if I did sitting on the floor, I could do it all day."
1485.96,1489.16," If I disappeared, that's what's happened to me then because I had actually a"
1489.16,1493.48," couple of weeks ago, someone threatened to to tell you to tell you on to tell"
1493.48,1496.5600000000002," you on me, whatever you want me to you to me."
1496.5600000000002,1498.8," Yeah, or do everyone order your bus."
1498.8,1500.0, It was like the usual thing.
1500.0,1503.3600000000001, Someone on there with some completely like stupid ass and
1503.36,1507.36," you know, conspiracy theory about how whatever is if it's like"
1507.36,1512.32," indebted to $1 sign, you know, or like whatever."
1512.32,1514.32, They think I got to figure it out.
1514.32,1517.76, And he just went on forever and then like I think we just started
1517.76,1520.4799999999998," clowning on the dude and he's got so we're kind of leaving you know,"
1520.4799999999998,1521.76, this is supposed to be professionally.
1521.76,1522.9599999999998, Try to pull that shit on like through.
1522.9599999999998,1523.9599999999998, Yeah.
1523.9599999999998,1525.76, You're going to try to pull the shit on me like this is jacking a box and
1525.76,1527.6799999999998, you're going to go tell my manager I didn't kiss your ass.
1527.6799999999998,1531.0," Like, well, I guess what man, my job is not to kiss your fucking ass."
1531.0,1532.0," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
1532.0,1533.0, Yeah.
1533.0,1534.0, What are you going to do?
1534.0,1535.0," And he's like, well, I'll go above."
1535.0,1536.0," I was like, what do you get?"
1536.0,1538.0," You tell Jeff Green, I mean, he's a go above that."
1538.0,1541.0," So I was like, okay, yeah, you got the shit down pretty well."
1541.0,1545.0," I was like, imagine he's someone in like the upper most echelons of"
1545.0,1549.0, Zifdevist corporate like opening a PM through one of that.
1549.0,1554.0, This guy's Sean told me to quit posting the company sold out to Microsoft.
1554.0,1556.0," There you got me, dude."
1556.0,1557.0, Yeah.
1557.0,1559.0," Yeah, that happened to me a couple of times when George Johnson was the"
1559.0,1563.0, editor in chief and I would get in some flame war over email with some guy and events.
1563.0,1566.0," And I'd be nice for a while, but after like the fourth, I'm like, yeah, you know what?"
1566.0,1567.0, Fuck you.
1567.0,1569.0," And then you're like, I'm telling your boss."
1569.0,1570.0," Like, go ahead."
1570.0,1572.0, We're going to have a good time laughing over you.
1572.0,1573.0, Thank you.
1573.0,1575.0, That's good stuff.
1575.0,1576.0, Yeah.
1576.0,1579.0, So let that be a warning to any of you out there actually offended by us if you think you're going
1579.0,1580.0, to write to our bosses.
1580.0,1582.0, We're kind of on our own here.
1582.0,1587.0, It's especially good stuff when you have been in a position where you would have to
1587.0,1588.0, fear that legitimately.
1588.0,1589.0, Yeah.
1589.0,1591.0, Like all my years in the grocery store and stuff.
1591.0,1592.0, Sometimes it happened.
1592.0,1593.0, Right.
1593.0,1595.0," You go under the back room and just like kind of like, like,"
1595.0,1596.0, or sweat off your brow.
1596.0,1597.0," Oh, God."
1597.0,1598.0, It could happen here.
1598.0,1599.0," We maybe shouldn't laugh too, ledly."
1599.0,1603.0, We could still get hauled into some jack booted assholes office and
1603.0,1605.0, I'm not talking about it.
1605.0,1606.0, None of my bosses.
1606.0,1608.0, I don't mean they're all super nice.
1608.0,1609.0, You're listening.
1609.0,1611.0, You're not a jack booted asshole.
1611.0,1612.0, We love you.
1612.0,1613.0," I love you, sir."
1613.0,1616.0, And it's been a privilege to work for you all these years.
1616.0,1617.0, Okay.
1617.0,1623.0," So, uh, well, we're talking internet stuff."
1623.0,1625.0," Yeah, exclusive, exclusive review."
1625.0,1626.0," Oh, yeah."
1626.0,1627.0," Oh, boy."
1627.0,1631.0, We've been meaning to get to the topic for a few weeks or a few years.
1631.0,1632.0, It always comes around.
1632.0,1634.0, Especially this time of year.
1634.0,1639.0, You got your big game releases coming out and we were always searching for a cover story
1639.0,1640.0, that we were doing.
1640.0,1647.0," We've been hit up with review covers, um, which we've kind of decided or we decided"
1647.0,1649.0," a while ago around here, not to do anymore."
1649.0,1650.0, Quite a long time ago.
1650.0,1651.0, Right.
1651.0,1654.0, And I'm pretty happy with that decision.
1654.0,1655.0, Yeah.
1655.0,1658.0," And it's just, yeah, I mean, that's kind of like where we've been on that."
1658.0,1666.0," And then it's stories like this that remind you of like, okay, so for whatever benefit you get out of the exercise on your your first and, uh,"
1667.0,1676.0," you know, being able to brag that you were the first to play the game, the blowback and skip this isn't from some scenarios like the one that we're about to discuss."
1676.0,1677.0, Yeah.
1677.0,1682.0," So this story was, the story was floating around the, the interwebs last one."
1682.0,1684.0, Say that Jeff ever in her webs.
1684.0,1685.0, Yeah.
1685.0,1687.0, That's not what you cool kids say now in her webs.
1687.0,1689.0, Coining inter tube really.
1689.0,1690.0, I'll talk about that.
1690.0,1692.0, So can I say it's a whole cast?
1692.0,1693.0, Hello.
1693.0,1694.0, No.
1694.0,1696.0, I'm trying to get him with the link.
1696.0,1697.0, Yeah.
1697.0,1698.0, That's whole webs.
1698.0,1701.0," So yeah, how are we going to break this?"
1701.0,1703.0," So basically, I'm gives it watch a while ago."
1703.0,1713.0, The original story was with an anonymous source and who claimed that while they were an employee of IGN at the time that prey came out.
1713.0,1721.0," That it was 2K, you know, and their PR team were saying, hey, you know, if you want this exclusive review, you know, you don't be able to be the first website to post that you know."
1721.0,1726.0, You don't want to be able to be the first website to post that you have the review of this and post your view.
1726.0,1732.0," You need to guarantee us that you're, you can give it a nine or higher on your one to tell us on your one to 10 scale."
1732.0,1741.0," So when the source alleged was that Doug Perry, who's position at the time was maybe you know,"
1741.0,1748.0," but something on the equivalent of it, I think for the, for not PlayStation, but maybe the whole thing the equivalent of an IGN, right?"
1748.0,1749.0, Yeah.
1749.0,1765.0," So they alleged, again, this is all, you know, alleged is the word here. So the source alleged that Mr. Perry went and asked the person assigned to the review for his or her, you know, for his actually take or guess what the score would be."
1765.0,1773.0," I thought they asked, you know, was there anybody here who felt comfortable, who thought they liked the game enough that they would be comfortable giving it this kind of stuff."
1773.0,1777.0," I'll have to, I would have to reread the original story because this is the follow up story that I'm front of me now."
1777.0,1788.0," Basically, um, after all that, you know, of course, created it, it's own minor internet sting, but so Doug responded, you know, on the same site and to the story and I don't want to read some of his response."
1788.0,1803.0," So he said, here's what happened. I entered in a several phone call conversations with PR director at 2K games. The content of our discussion was about whether my former company IGN should get the exclusive review for prey, which was the biggest game of the summer of 2006, clearly a dry summer."
1803.0,1811.0, IGN has always been keen on obtaining exclusive reviews. The tricky part of the equation is to get exclusive on games that we like and they got traffic.
1811.0,1819.0," And that's a big, if not the biggest portion of the driving force behind media sites. They want to drive traffic to sell ads to make money,"
1819.0,1823.0, while performing the journalistic matter of entertaining and informing its readers.
1823.0,1830.0," So he continues that, um, so that's all fair so far. Right. It's difficult to gauge whether gamers worth getting an exclusive on it,"
1830.0,1836.0," and it is a sensitive matter, but for anyone who has been an editor in the entertainment business, negotiating exclusives happens all the time."
1836.0,1844.0," In this situation, the PR person wanted to know a range on what we would score the game, so she can make it decision whether or not to give us the exclusive."
1844.0,1851.0," Part of the PR person's job is to look for an outlet that hears she thinks really likes the game and then hope they give it a good score. In this case, and it's not unheard of,"
1851.0,1859.0," the PR person wanted to know the score beforehand. We didn't have the score yet because the writer at hand, Tom McNamara,"
1859.0,1864.0," an excellent writer and a reviewer hadn't finished the game. Even if I'd known the score and Tom would finish their review,"
1864.0,1868.0," we could not have given out the final score, but we would have provided a range of scores."
1868.0,1876.0," Okay. So, um, moving on, he says there are several phone calls. I felt too k was being assertive or you could say aggressive,"
1876.0,1882.0," but I decided to gauge whether the game was worth getting the exclusive on, and I was persistent about it because I wanted to make a decision on whether we should reschedule our front page,"
1882.0,1886.0, get the artwork and go through the motions of making this our top story or not.
1886.0,1890.0," More importantly, I wanted to know whether the game deserved an exclusive."
1890.0,1895.0," The whole issue brought up by your source is that a game score shouldn't be discussed with the PR side prior to completion,"
1895.0,1898.0, because that somehow breaks the code of ethics. I don't share this opinion.
1898.0,1902.0," There's nothing wrong with talking to staff members about how good a game is,"
1902.0,1907.0," how one should score, how one should score it before it's reviewed and whether it should be a top story or not."
1907.0,1911.0," What bothered the source is that I was being pressured and providing a score before the game was completed,"
1911.0,1917.0," but having been in the business for 13 years now, I felt like a handle the pressure, and this is in quotes from 2K games."
1917.0,1921.0," So, grab up his comments and we see, uh,"
1921.0,1929.0," okay, let me just continue here. Actually, this is all pretty important since we're into it."
1930.0,1934.0," Tom didn't know the score because he hadn't finished the game, so I said Tom, what do you think of this game?"
1934.0,1937.0," How would you score it now, and if so, what would you honestly give it?"
1937.0,1940.0, I needed to know your honest opinion because we might have an exclusive here.
1940.0,1947.0," The themes here are clarity and honestly, the emphasis on the conversation wasn't by any means to pressure anybody in the scoring the game higher."
1947.0,1954.0," I, jinn, never did that. The point was to gauge whether we could determine how good the game was and whether it was worth getting an exclusive on this way,"
1954.0,1960.0," or range, for instance, the game is between the 7 and 9, which would then help the publisher decide whether they wanted to go with us or not."
1960.0,1969.0," So, there's a lot of repetition here, but basically, he says that, you know, they ultimately refused the exclusive as did 1up.com, which he notes."
1969.0,1972.0," And that looking back, prey was a tempest in a T-pot."
1972.0,1976.0," I jinn scored the game in 9, 1 up and 8, 1 in game spot of 7, 5."
1976.0,1981.0, I'd say that now the score should have been somewhere between a high 7 and a low 8 at best.
1981.0,1992.0," At the time, less than a year after Xbox 360 launch, pressure would offer some great graphics, offered some cool physical puzzles and intriguing alien subduck native American concept."
1992.0,1995.0," In hindsight, which was always 2020, prey was only pretty good."
1995.0,2001.0," Offering mediocre enemy AI, a story that was cooler in concept than execution and rough and tumble multiplayer gaming."
2001.0,2009.0," That's interesting to say that he would give it somewhere around an 8, a low 8, but that it's mediocre."
2009.0,2013.0," So, I felt that Tommy over scored the game, but it was his game review and his opinion shaped it."
2013.0,2024.0," Reviewing a game is an art, a subjective affair, not a science. There was no wrongdoing, ethical misconduct and no big conspiracy. The matter was simple."
2024.0,2027.0," So, that's basically the thrust of the story."
2027.0,2035.0," I mean, you can go and find the rest of it on there, and the title of the story is mere IGN, is mere ignorance with IGN capitalizing."
2035.0,2044.0," So, I don't know how we wanted to respond, but first off, what struck me in that was that, you know, no offense to Doug,"
2044.0,2050.0," I mean, our stunt was coming from, but it's constantly saying, you know, we are certain of our integrity."
2050.0,2054.0," We know that none of this is influencing us, and this is fine."
2054.0,2059.0," But that leaves open the matter of seeming in propriety, which you can never prove otherwise."
2059.0,2067.0," I mean, and so it's also, you know, when you're talking about good, you know, journalists of practice, it's, I believe it's a good journalists of practice to avoid that."
2067.0,2077.0," But more so, I think it is especially, you know, there is, you know, a great deal of seeming in propriety, because if you are a viewer, say for example, you know,"
2077.0,2087.0," it's me, and I'm reviewing it, and you're my boss, and I know that it's in our sights interest to have this exclusive to have the first reveal in this game, because it's going to get us hits."
2087.0,2093.0," Right, whether or not we love the game or not, people want to read about it because it's been advertised, it's been discussed."
2093.0,2099.0," And so in the back of my mind, even if you never say Sean, yeah, I need this game to get a certain amount of work to be on here."
2099.0,2111.0," I understand that that's the case, and I know that my, if I'm alone, if I take a chance and say, wow, maybe I'm just a harsh or critical this game than anyone else in the office, maybe I, maybe I shouldn't trust myself."
2111.0,2113.0, Maybe it really is closer to a nine.
2113.0,2121.0," I think those are very real, and I don't think that that is, you know, that that's a situation that you can just dismiss by saying, oh, well, we're,"
2121.0,2127.0, or if I think you're giving it to this on the eye and I think of giving it to someone who I think might score higher.
2127.0,2133.0," I mean, what if I were to say, yeah, Sean's kind of tough, and he's a little bit cynical."
2133.0,2137.0, Maybe I'll give it to somebody else who might give it a higher score.
2137.0,2141.0," And that's there too, which I don't, I don't believe he did. I mean, I think he has a pretty,"
2141.0,2147.0," a mostly defensible position, especially since he ended up not getting the exclusive, right?"
2147.0,2153.0," Right, and they don't think it's a movie anyway, but yeah, probably you just don't want to go there at all, right?"
2153.0,2157.0, You don't want to even just leave it open to misinterpretation.
2157.0,2159.0, And another conversation.
2159.0,2163.0," I mean, I totally agree with that, and I think that like, I just, I personally, I would not want to be in that situation,"
2163.0,2167.0," and I know that depending on the person, I mean, that's just,"
2167.0,2169.0," you shouldn't, we shouldn't pose that pressure on someone."
2169.0,2173.0, You shouldn't have that on your mind as your critique in a game.
2173.0,2175.0," Right, right."
2175.0,2177.0," I don't believe that that's something that you should be,"
2177.0,2179.0, I thought you should be entertaining.
2179.0,2184.0," Right, if someone came to me and said that, you know, I'm just trying to think of some more situation."
2184.0,2188.0," It doesn't entirely apply, but let's say, I knew that if,"
2188.0,2192.0," it wouldn't be a magazine cover, but let's say I knew that something great would happen if we scored the scale."
2192.0,2197.0," And if we scored the scale, great, it would be me not to say anything."
2197.0,2204.0," So the person who was reviewing that game, I should not forward that information to the person who's job it is to review it."
2204.0,2206.0," Right, you can put the pressure on them for that."
2206.0,2209.0," Right, but that's another thing is that I think, you know,"
2209.0,2212.0," Doug says that, you know,"
2212.0,2216.0, angling for exclusives negotiating exclusives just a general part of the business.
2216.0,2217.0, And that is true.
2217.0,2221.0," What's not true, though, is, you know, exclusive reviews or angling for exclusives with any,"
2221.0,2223.0, kind of conditions imposed on them.
2223.0,2226.0," When we get exclusive cover stories and things like this,"
2226.0,2229.0," there are never any conditions like,"
2229.0,2231.0," I mean, the conditions might be, yeah,"
2231.0,2233.0," well, if we give you all this first look at this,"
2233.0,2235.0," we expected to the image of the game, the name,"
2235.0,2237.0," do appear on your cover, right?"
2237.0,2241.0," Or my promise of certain amount of pages say,"
2241.0,2244.0," hey, we need at least eight pages or something if we're going to do this otherwise,"
2244.0,2246.0," you know, go here because they're offering us 12."
2246.0,2247.0, Sure.
2247.0,2254.0," But that's not the content, and so far as like you need to provide us with a certain number of quotes that we could use for marketing."
2254.0,2258.0," You need to guarantee us that it's going to be, you know, like overwhelming,"
2258.0,2262.0," positive and tone, or that you're going to make any claims that,"
2262.0,2267.0," you know, this will be the hottest game of this genre X, you know, in this season."
2267.0,2271.0," And that's, you know, I mean, those are kind of similar to saying,"
2271.0,2273.0, here's what the score is going to be.
2273.0,2275.0," But the other, you know,"
2275.0,2278.0," this side effect of all this, I think, is for the audiences."
2278.0,2283.0," If you know that at least in some circumstances, see what happens is this story,"
2283.0,2287.0," I believe diminishes the value of an exclusive review all around,"
2287.0,2291.0," not specifically this, but this kind of thing, because what it means now is that"
2291.0,2295.0," you're going to wonder, well, if I see an exclusive review for something,"
2295.0,2299.0," wasn't negotiated under circumstances similar to this one, right?"
2299.0,2302.0," And does that then mean that every time you see an exclusive review,"
2302.0,2307.0," basically going to be the most enthusiastic and overwhelmingly positive,"
2307.0,2309.0," right, that the company could arrange to have."
2309.0,2312.0," And then as a consumer, how helpful is that to you,"
2312.0,2316.0," if you're just looking at the review for a buyer's guide, right?"
2316.0,2319.0," If you're looking at a critical level, I think it answers itself too."
2319.0,2325.0," You know, I mean, well, they don't know why we're on the biggest fan of game X says to say about it."
2325.0,2328.0," Yeah, I mean, I think that's why we stopped doing them."
2328.0,2330.0," You know, that's not the number one reason."
2330.0,2336.0," Number two was that, you know, to avoid any kind of pressure or whatever,"
2336.0,2339.0," or hassle from the game company to like the game,"
2339.0,2345.0," more than we normally would, you know, or just the perception that we might, you know,"
2345.0,2348.0," or you know, there's a lot of ships stuff."
2348.0,2352.0," Yeah, so say, for example, you ordinarily considered that you had a good relationship."
2352.0,2354.0," And when we say we have a good relationship with the company,"
2354.0,2357.0," that means that we just, things seem fine,"
2357.0,2359.0, we communicate well with one another and once.
2359.0,2362.0," But what if, say for example, you got an exclusive review for game X,"
2362.0,2365.0," and then the company thought they took it personally,"
2365.0,2366.0," hey, we don't like this."
2366.0,2369.0," And then comes time and you want to do a first look,"
2369.0,2371.0," you know, preview type story and something else,"
2371.0,2374.0," then are they going to be like, well, we don't want to give it to them,"
2374.0,2376.0," because they, they shit on our last game."
2376.0,2379.0," Yeah, you know, I mean, it's just like, obviously they want a good review."
2379.0,2381.0," I mean, that's kind of a duh."
2381.0,2384.0," If we put the game on the cover with a review,"
2384.0,2387.0," yeah, I think even if you, the expectation just because it's on the cover,"
2387.0,2389.0, it's this must be good.
2389.0,2390.0," Right. You know, of course."
2390.0,2393.0," And you read or looking at it doesn't get a think while they put this on their cover,"
2393.0,2394.0, and they gave it a two.
2394.0,2396.0," And the X, when is that ever happened?"
2396.0,2398.0," Generally, why would you do that?"
2398.0,2402.0," Generally, when I was with very average scores,"
2402.0,2404.0," back when we did them, right?"
2404.0,2405.0, Yeah.
2405.0,2407.0," In many cases, you're hedging your bets by doing this,"
2407.0,2410.0," and you don't really have to worry about, you know,"
2410.0,2412.0," coming away with it with a black eye, coming away from it with a black eye,"
2412.0,2418.0," because you only consider a game for a cover review when you've played various early versions of it,"
2418.0,2420.0," and you're already like, okay, this is pretty cool."
2420.0,2426.0," And this is also more importantly, this is very popular to the extent that a review of an exclusive review"
2426.0,2432.0, this will sell this magazine or will sell this website for clicks and views and stuff.
2432.0,2435.0," So nine times out of ten, I think it's not a problem."
2435.0,2436.0," I mean, you get it."
2436.0,2438.0, You probably is a great game.
2438.0,2439.0, It gets a great review.
2439.0,2442.0," You as a look so bad, but hey, we know there are exceptions to it."
2442.0,2443.0, There are definitely exceptions to it.
2443.0,2445.0," And even when it's a fine shade, you know, I mean,"
2445.0,2450.0," when he's, you know, splitting hairs between an eight and a nine to the point where he's saying that an eight is like,"
2450.0,2453.0," so-so, and then nine of the conversation."
2453.0,2455.0," You know, I mean, yeah."
2455.0,2459.0," And then the other part, too, is like a lot of the times, you know,"
2459.0,2465.0," when we've been in the situation where these types of exclusive reviews have been offered to us,"
2465.0,2470.0," coming with the set of, you know, the circumstances in which we would have to review it."
2470.0,2475.0," Are ones were not comfortable with either in terms of having to do it at their offices,"
2475.0,2479.0," because the code is, you know, is being squirled away."
2479.0,2484.0, Or probably worse is that the game has a heavy multiplayer component.
2484.0,2491.0," And by doing it so far ahead of time, you're playing it before the gaming community is actually seen it yet or playing."
2491.0,2495.0," Right. So you're talking about multiplayer aspects that you don't know shit about,"
2495.0,2499.0, because basically you're playing it with a bunch of the guys who made the game in their office.
2499.0,2502.0," You know, they could do anything there to rig the experience."
2502.0,2506.0," And even if they're not rigging it, you're still not getting a real-world experience."
2506.0,2511.0," That's an especially important point for PC games, too, because I think with reviews,"
2511.0,2516.0, the traditional notion is that multiplayer content is like the bonus material.
2516.0,2520.0," So, you know, you say if you spent 30 hours or whatever playing the main game,"
2520.0,2525.0," and then there's a multiplayer component, you might play it in the afternoon in a session with some people"
2525.0,2528.0, that the company was some QA department of people.
2528.0,2535.0," You know, now when the game is an MMO, or when the game is like something like Quake Wars or Battlefield that are,"
2535.0,2539.0," that is based on, you know, the multiplayer experience,"
2539.0,2542.0," you're really, again, it kind of goes back to,"
2542.0,2548.0," and I don't think you're really offering an in-depth look on the consumer report side of things,"
2548.0,2552.0," and you're especially not on the critical side of things, because it's just not enough time."
2552.0,2555.0," I mean, you can go in and make a few generalizations."
2555.0,2561.0," You know, like say if I had to review Team Fortress 2 based on, you know, a couple hours of playing at a press party,"
2561.0,2565.0," or something, you know, like, yeah, the spy was kind of fun in this nap,"
2565.0,2566.0," but it's like, give me a break."
2566.0,2568.0," I mean, it's so much played that game for years."
2568.0,2569.0, I know.
2569.0,2573.0," I can tell you how well that you start to understand the game, and it's both its flaws,"
2573.0,2576.0," and it's, you know, accomplishment and it's triumphs."
2576.0,2581.0, But I can tell you a non-review anecdote of the game that was totally different at the company
2581.0,2585.0," than it was in real life, and that was the Sims Online."
2585.0,2590.0," When Robert Coffee and I went to see the scam when it was early on in its development years ago,"
2590.0,2596.0," it was being played by guys like Will Wright and his associates who are all super smart,"
2596.0,2597.0, funny creative people.
2597.0,2602.0," And the things that they were doing inside that game themselves, the ones making the game,"
2602.0,2603.0, was really neat.
2603.0,2609.0," You know, it was like, wow, they created this whole universe in which you could make these really funny rooms to do this that and the other."
2609.0,2615.0," Because they're super smart people, and they were invested totally in making this game look cool."
2615.0,2621.0," But when the game actually came out, when you had real people in their playing,"
2621.0,2623.0, it turned out to be a disaster.
2623.0,2625.0," It was just like a large chat room, right?"
2625.0,2626.0," No, it made real people."
2626.0,2627.0," It was like, well, right?"
2627.0,2629.0," Yeah, Will Wright is not a real person."
2629.0,2638.0, So that was an example to me of a multiplayer game that was all about the community.
2638.0,2641.0, The review had to be based on the community.
2641.0,2643.0, It was nothing without that.
2643.0,2644.0, That's all that game was.
2644.0,2646.0, And the community actually was retarded.
2646.0,2651.0," So, not all fans, if you still play that game, you probably personally are on a retard,"
2651.0,2654.0, but the other people are.
2654.0,2659.0," But yeah, so, and that's definitely the case with a battlefield to or whatever."
2659.0,2665.0," If you're playing it in advance for your exclusive review on EA servers, internal servers,"
2665.0,2667.0, you're not playing the game.
2667.0,2669.0, That's not the game that the rest of us are playing.
2669.0,2674.0," Another one you're going to be seeing is, you know, like, we just got in code today for a,"
2674.0,2678.0," in territory, place where we just like, you know, like a late beta, whatever,"
2678.0,2681.0," which, you know, of course, we're not going to review it off of that until we play the live."
2681.0,2682.0, Right.
2682.0,2685.0," But I can say, hey, we can make it in someone going to."
2685.0,2690.0, I guarantee you are going to be seeing reviews of that in other publications.
2690.0,2691.0, Right.
2691.0,2697.0," And those are bullshit reviews because, yes, the gameplay mechanics are going to be the same."
2697.0,2700.0," So, you could strictly say, this thing works this way, this, this is cool or not."
2700.0,2705.0," But when you're, it's higher experience revolves around your interaction with other people."
2705.0,2708.0, I just don't see how you could come up with the real score there.
2708.0,2711.0," The challenge for us, though, is saying that, okay, we believe it all these things."
2711.0,2712.0, Okay.
2712.0,2716.0," We have to have an audience to, to whom these very same things are important to,"
2716.0,2721.0," because, sure, otherwise, because the assumption in all these scenarios is not that our,"
2721.0,2727.0," our ultimate priority is to put together, you know, a very concise and penetrating review"
2727.0,2731.0," or analysis of something, or it's not to direct someone to the best buying decision or something."
2731.0,2736.0," It's to get them to click our thing or to buy our book just because we can say,"
2736.0,2739.0, we were the first in the door on something.
2739.0,2743.0," And if, as an audience, I mean, we know that that, that that, that works."
2743.0,2744.0, It's a lucrative strategy.
2744.0,2745.0, Yes.
2745.0,2747.0," And in, sometimes, I mean, the debate is always for us."
2747.0,2752.0," I mean, we're shooting ourselves in the foot by not, we could rush this review."
2752.0,2757.0," I could go play this thing tonight, you know, and come back and, and I won't look like an idiot."
2757.0,2762.0," Well, if I did, I mean, I'm playing the band stuff, but at the same time, I will not personally feel like"
2762.0,2764.0, I'm the authority that I'm pretending.
2764.0,2765.0, Right.
2765.0,2770.0," No, that we have plenty of, plenty of our competition is willing to rush right in where we won't."
2770.0,2774.0," And say, fuck yeah, we'll do the exclusive review because we just say no."
2774.0,2776.0, And who's right and who's wrong there?
2776.0,2777.0, I don't know.
2777.0,2778.0, Maybe we are shooting ourselves in the foot.
2778.0,2779.0, And they're definitely not wrong.
2779.0,2784.0," I mean, if you're the audience and that's what you want, I mean, you can't go wrong."
2784.0,2787.0," I mean, you're serving, you're serving an audience, you know, but so it's like, we're kind of like,"
2787.0,2792.0," begging, hey, if this stuff is important to you, then let it be known."
2792.0,2793.0," Yeah, I guess."
2793.0,2794.0, That's a good.
2794.0,2797.0," Yeah, so otherwise, we could hook you up some reviews tonight."
2797.0,2800.0," Yeah, well, this is the exclusive review of all the beta code we have."
2800.0,2802.0, And we'll be first.
2802.0,2805.0," Yeah, exclusive, scooper view."
2805.0,2810.0," Okay, so maybe we should take a break and come back on a little less serious note."
2810.0,2811.0, Sure.
2811.0,2812.0, Sounds like a good idea.
2812.0,2815.0, We'll come back with some comedy hijinks.
2815.0,2816.0, Hey.
2816.0,2818.0," Yo, yeah."
2818.0,2819.0, Hey.
2819.0,2821.0," Three, two, one."
2821.0,2822.0, Here we go.
2822.0,2831.0," Listen to EGMI, the weekly podcast for electronic gaming monthly, available every Monday"
2831.0,2835.0, for download at EGMI.1up.com or podcast.
2835.0,2838.0, That one up.com or the iTunes music store.
2838.0,2839.0, Sweet the leg.
2839.0,2842.0, Sweet the leg.
2842.0,2843.0, We're back.
2843.0,2845.0," Uh, hey, I know how to start it."
2845.0,2846.0," Yes, sir."
2846.0,2848.0, How to come back into happiness.
2848.0,2849.0, Yeah.
2849.0,2850.0, Check out Darren's face.
2851.0,2853.0," Oh, here we go."
2853.0,2854.0," That's wrong, Darren."
2854.0,2855.0, No.
2855.0,2858.0, We need to record another GFW radio promo sometime.
2858.0,2859.0, Yeah.
2859.0,2862.0, Because they've been repeating for a long time in light of time.
2862.0,2863.0, I don't know.
2863.0,2865.0," You know, walking for your mom's ass."
2865.0,2866.0, I just thought of this.
2866.0,2868.0, I like that the rap still gets quoted online.
2868.0,2869.0, That makes me happy.
2869.0,2870.0, Yeah.
2870.0,2871.0, You're starting.
2871.0,2872.0, Yeah.
2872.0,2875.0, I think they say old Jewish white guys can't rap.
2875.0,2876.0, There's some proof.
2876.0,2879.0, Instead of saying this is out of us walking over your mom's ass.
2879.0,2884.0, You want to say that your mom's ass looks like two pig squabbling over a milk dud.
2884.0,2887.0," Oh, man."
2887.0,2889.0," You need to visualize like, like,"
2889.0,2891.0, I just don't want to.
2891.0,2894.0, Just wriggling.
2894.0,2895.0, Yeah.
2895.0,2896.0, That's true.
2896.0,2899.0, This isn't quite poop.
2899.0,2900.0, I love old man.
2900.0,2901.0," I was just, I'm sorry."
2901.0,2902.0, I'm sorry.
2902.0,2903.0, I'm sorry.
2903.0,2904.0, I'm sorry.
2904.0,2906.0, I'm sorry.
2906.0,2907.0, I'm sorry.
2907.0,2909.0, Did the milk dud's what makes it though?
2909.0,2910.0, Yeah.
2910.0,2912.0, It's something.
2912.0,2913.0, Yeah.
2913.0,2914.0, It's me.
2914.0,2916.0," Well, I came back."
2916.0,2917.0, Welcome back.
2917.0,2919.0, I told you I could bring it.
2919.0,2920.0, Yeah.
2920.0,2921.0, Thanks for bringing it back to a happy place.
2921.0,2923.0, So what you've been playing?
2923.0,2925.0," Well, I've been playing things for the segue."
2925.0,2929.0, I've been playing football.
2929.0,2934.0," Well, I got on the call duty for beta on Xbox Live."
2934.0,2936.0, So I've been playing a bunch of that.
2936.0,2937.0, Yeah.
2937.0,2938.0, Why is that not on PC?
2938.0,2939.0, I don't know.
2939.0,2940.0, I was going to bring that up.
2940.0,2941.0, Why is it not on PC?
2941.0,2944.0," Well, what call duty originated on console?"
2944.0,2947.0, It just makes sense that they would cater to the console.
2947.0,2948.0, Yeah.
2948.0,2951.0," I wasn't only much of a PC game, I've never had a PC."
2951.0,2952.0, Yeah.
2952.0,2954.0," Fuck you, Activision!"
2954.0,2956.0, Just kidding.
2956.0,2957.0, I love you guys.
2957.0,2961.0, And I wonder why I have bad relations with the PR people.
2961.0,2962.0, Return my call.
2962.0,2966.0, So you're playing it?
2966.0,2967.0, How is it?
2967.0,2969.0, It's actually a lot of fun.
2969.0,2970.0, Looks pretty great.
2970.0,2971.0, Yeah.
2971.0,2972.0," As you all know, it's in modern times now."
2972.0,2980.0, There's some like vague Arabic scroll on the walls as you run by these abandoned buildings and stuff like that.
2980.0,2982.0, Yeah.
2982.0,2985.0, They've got a nice kind of leveling up system going on.
2985.0,2988.0," Honestly, I got to say."
2988.0,2991.0, It's just on the multiplayer side.
2991.0,2995.0, I'm not seeing a lot that it's going to sound very snobby PC.
2995.0,2997.0, This is why I'm hesitating with my words.
2997.0,3001.0, I feel like we've done this before already with this game.
3001.0,3003.0, That's how shooters go.
3003.0,3004.0," I mean, yeah."
3004.0,3005.0, You got guns.
3005.0,3009.0," I mean, I was waiting to be blown away because frankly, it did look amazing."
3009.0,3010.0, What we saw at E3.
3010.0,3012.0, And this multiplayer beta.
3012.0,3014.0, And this does.
3014.0,3016.0, Don't take all this with the grain of salt.
3016.0,3018.0, The game could be.
3018.0,3019.0, Yeah.
3019.0,3025.0, We saw on this multiplayer beta seemed very kind of run of the mill.
3025.0,3027.0, They've got to say.
3027.0,3028.0, Activision.
3028.0,3031.0," I mean, the activation in Finiwards called it in multiplayer games."
3031.0,3033.0, I've always had say been run into mill technically.
3033.0,3034.0, Yeah.
3034.0,3040.0," When you were if you list the bullet points or anything, although this time they're, you know, they're working to go beyond that with the whole,"
3040.0,3043.0," persistence in, you know, rank and perks system."
3043.0,3045.0, And the ranking system so far is cool.
3045.0,3046.0, But the like it.
3047.0,3053.0," The reason why they've worked is because despite the fact if someone say, hey, well, what's this game about, you know, you can name off the modes."
3053.0,3059.0," And if they're not literally taking from other games, you'll find something analogy perfectly analogous in every game."
3059.0,3066.0," But the response, the feedback you get from the weapons and the feel of things make it work really well."
3066.0,3067.0, And they do.
3067.0,3075.0," I mean, it's just night and day if you compare it to like some of the previous, like at the time, the multiplayer for some of the metal wanders compared to call, call,"
3075.0,3080.0," duty one multiplayer or especially night of offensive, which I was a big fan of."
3080.0,3082.0," And call, do you two multiplayer?"
3082.0,3083.0," I mean, it's really simple."
3083.0,3086.0, You just have an assortment of guns you run around the map and you shoot dudes.
3086.0,3087.0, Right.
3087.0,3088.0, But the feedback was great.
3088.0,3089.0," I mean, you hit someone."
3089.0,3092.0, It felt like they're accurate and exactly the way you'd expect them.
3092.0,3095.0, They're lethal to the way that you would expect them to be.
3095.0,3097.0, And that was all very important.
3097.0,3100.0," You know, when I was talking about like metal of honor, but last week."
3100.0,3104.0," And about how it kind of fires your expectations by, you know, you hit someone in the,"
3104.0,3108.0, the throat with like a rifle round and then he kind of just does the jack and a box job.
3108.0,3110.0, It meets like the opposite of that.
3110.0,3112.0," It's like you get your like boom, there's your satisfaction."
3112.0,3113.0, Yeah.
3113.0,3114.0, And you go on.
3114.0,3116.0, So they've been fun for that reason.
3116.0,3117.0, Yeah.
3117.0,3119.0, I've definitely had a good time.
3119.0,3121.0, I just haven't been blown away.
3121.0,3132.0, And I should also say that I'm equally biased by the fact that this was really my first time playing my first experience with Xbox live with the headset in multiplayer.
3132.0,3133.0," Oh, man."
3133.0,3134.0, So yeah.
3134.0,3137.0, So I wasn't quite expecting that.
3137.0,3140.0, And so that has nothing to do with the game itself.
3140.0,3141.0, Really.
3141.0,3146.0," And so I shouldn't hold infinity water activism or the game, you know, right?"
3146.0,3149.0, Shouldn't hold that against the fact that I'm talking about.
3149.0,3151.0, I know calling me a retard.
3151.0,3154.0, You're just talking about how you don't know a game until you play it with the community.
3154.0,3155.0," So they're like, yeah, there you go."
3155.0,3158.0," You could, you just met because you couldn't be like, I'm fucking Jeff Green."
3158.0,3159.0," And they're like, yeah."
3159.0,3160.0," They're like, who's that?"
3160.0,3162.0," Like, considering she's a tag of you."
3162.0,3163.0, She's a tag of you.
3163.0,3164.0, CTW Jeff.
3164.0,3165.0, Yeah.
3165.0,3166.0," I wasn't exactly playing it on him, is he?"
3166.0,3167.0," Yeah, but that's the thing."
3167.0,3172.0," You might as well be if you're playing Xbox, CGW, that means she's a, you might as well be a FK Jeff or something."
3172.0,3173.0, Yeah.
3173.0,3174.0, You're right.
3174.0,3175.0, But it was just a whole lot of.
3175.0,3177.0, I'm going to put a cap on your ass.
3177.0,3179.0," You know, all day long when I was playing."
3179.0,3183.0," It's like there's only so much of that you can take when you're when, when gear on the"
3183.0,3184.0, first came out.
3184.0,3185.0, The Xbox live headset.
3185.0,3187.0, The stupidest thing you could put on your head.
3187.0,3188.0, The side of the shotgun barrel.
3189.0,3192.0, You're fighting that whole trailer and all about it.
3192.0,3193.0, Yeah.
3193.0,3198.0," First of all, I feel a little bad that I came off kind of this in the game because, you know,"
3198.0,3201.0, that was just my experience with the multiplayer beta so far.
3201.0,3204.0, But so you're probably just disin the experience of being with those people.
3204.0,3206.0, I think that is what I'm disinfect.
3206.0,3210.0, It was like being on that would you describe the experience as being like visiting the guns.
3210.0,3212.0, A lot message board in this.
3212.0,3213.0, It's kind of it.
3213.0,3214.0, Yeah.
3214.0,3217.0," It made me think like, okay, what I'm going to do is I'm going to play Call Duty for single player."
3217.0,3219.0, That's what I'm going to do.
3219.0,3220.0, Yeah.
3220.0,3222.0, I'm curious about some of the higher end stuff.
3222.0,3225.0," I'm not sure if you noticed it, but the way that the air strikes work."
3225.0,3226.0," Oh, I did see that."
3226.0,3230.0," You know, you're going to spree and you get enough like consecutive kills."
3230.0,3231.0, Uh-huh.
3231.0,3233.0, The time frame two call in an air strike after that.
3233.0,3236.0," You get, you know, another three or five more and then you can call in an attack chopper."
3236.0,3237.0, Yes.
3237.0,3238.0, But did see that happen?
3238.0,3239.0, My worries.
3239.0,3242.0, Because of the way that game is spawn system.
3242.0,3244.0," I've heard people say that, you know,"
3244.0,3246.0," yeah, it's just the way it always has been."
3246.0,3249.0, It's basically based on proximity and team.
3249.0,3254.0, So wherever the biggest clump of your surviving teammates are is where you will spawn.
3254.0,3259.0," And then always in like, you know, there's like maybe like eight or ten various areas that you can go through."
3259.0,3266.0," But they will be, it will pick this, one of those eight or ten based on proximity to the greatest amount of surviving teammates."
3266.0,3270.0," But the consequence of that was always, hey, I see three dudes over there."
3270.0,3273.0, I'm going to throw my fucking grenades and shit because people are probably going to be appearing right next year.
3273.0,3275.0, Now I'm going to get some kills.
3275.0,3279.0," And now you add to that the ability to throw in air strikes instead of your,"
3279.0,3283.0," you steal a hang on that and then you get like,"
3283.0,3287.0," you know, ten kills off of that and then the ten kills give you the next rank,"
3287.0,3289.0, which is the helicopter and you get some more kills off of that.
3289.0,3291.0," I'm just, this is just hypothesis here."
3291.0,3293.0," But I've, I've, I suspect."
3293.0,3295.0, I'm worried about that part of it.
3295.0,3296.0, Mm-hmm.
3296.0,3300.0," Well, there's always going to be people exploiting those things and going for the cheap kills."
3300.0,3301.0, Yeah.
3301.0,3304.0, It was great listening to everybody talking about camping and all that.
3304.0,3306.0," It was like, wow, man, stuff doesn't have our changes."
3306.0,3307.0, Yeah.
3307.0,3310.0," Doesn't matter what game, what platform, what year."
3310.0,3313.0, So I'll guys talking about camping each other.
3313.0,3314.0," Same role, yeah."
3314.0,3315.0, Yeah.
3315.0,3318.0," Camping in this kind of game is just annoying too because depending on the game,"
3318.0,3322.0," I mean, that's the problem with going too lethal with any of your weapons."
3322.0,3324.0," Is you create an environment where you don't want to do anything,"
3324.0,3328.0," but lay down the moment you spawn and then like shoot the first guy stupid enough or like,"
3328.0,3330.0, impatient enough to move.
3330.0,3332.0, A lot of the ghosts recombinant player ended up that way.
3332.0,3335.0," I mean, ghosts recombinant, grought to you on Xbox."
3335.0,3338.0," If you played a map and you're enabled to sniper weapons or whatever, it was like, okay,"
3338.0,3340.0," you spawn lay down, maybe crawl a little bit."
3340.0,3344.0, And then the first guy that's stupid enough to get up and try to run somewhere is dead.
3344.0,3348.0," And then he waits to rest in the round, specking a bunch of people laying down."
3348.0,3350.0, I think you got that slumber party with guns.
3350.0,3351.0, So bad.
3351.0,3355.0," I know if you played shooters, you know that experience."
3355.0,3356.0, Yeah.
3356.0,3357.0, It's a hard thing to prevent because you don't want that.
3357.0,3358.0, That's not fun.
3358.0,3359.0," No, you don't want that at all."
3359.0,3360.0, That's fun.
3360.0,3362.0, If you're one of the guys sniping.
3362.0,3363.0, Yeah.
3363.0,3367.0," But the thing that called you the reason it doesn't work, it should say is that they got the kill camp,"
3367.0,3372.0," which was a great introduction to the genre in that you cannot instead of wondering, like,"
3372.0,3374.0, who the fuck did that?
3374.0,3375.0, Yep.
3375.0,3376.0, Yep.
3376.0,3377.0, Then you just get to see the movie.
3377.0,3378.0, I'm doing it.
3378.0,3379.0, Yeah.
3379.0,3380.0," But I guess now because you have all this other powerups, like,"
3380.0,3383.0, juggernaut and things that give you extra stamina and extra endurance.
3383.0,3386.0," And so you're really wondering, like, dude, I just get that got the full clip."
3386.0,3387.0, Why is he not dead?
3387.0,3388.0, Yeah.
3388.0,3389.0, What is this guy hacker?
3389.0,3390.0, Because that's the ultimate thing.
3390.0,3391.0, Is it hack?
3391.0,3392.0, Is it hack?
3392.0,3395.0," Um, at least look and see what powerups he had equipped."
3395.0,3396.0, Yeah.
3396.0,3398.0," His loadout was and say, okay."
3398.0,3399.0, Yeah.
3399.0,3404.0, I was watching the kill camp a lot in the Call 34 beta because I was dead a lot of the time.
3404.0,3405.0, Yeah.
3405.0,3406.0, So I kept watching the cocaine.
3406.0,3410.0," And actually more than watching the other guys and what they were doing to kill me,"
3410.0,3412.0, I was just more like ashamed of my own performance.
3412.0,3415.0," I was like, what, you know, watching myself play through their eyes."
3415.0,3416.0, Yeah.
3416.0,3417.0," Like, jump at a wall."
3417.0,3421.0," Did you know, like, not doing anything or switching weapons, like, man, like, if I'd be"
3421.0,3424.0," running around in the corner, seeing me, you're like, nice."
3424.0,3425.0, Easy kill.
3425.0,3427.0," In your name, you know, this is the same guy."
3427.0,3429.0," Everyone's like, pro tip."
3429.0,3430.0, Go for GFW.
3430.0,3432.0," Jeff, I'm in for easy money."
3432.0,3433.0, Right.
3433.0,3435.0," New, but in the Southeast corner."
3435.0,3436.0, Yeah.
3436.0,3437.0, Yeah.
3437.0,3438.0, That was my experience.
3438.0,3439.0, That was my weekend gaming.
3439.0,3440.0, That plus company heroes.
3440.0,3444.0, I went back to play the original game so that I could play the posing front.
3444.0,3445.0, Yeah.
3445.0,3450.0, So we're still going to have to hold off on the posing front's talk until we get some games going.
3450.0,3451.0, Yeah.
3451.0,3453.0, Maybe get some great game though.
3453.0,3462.0," I know I've been playing enough of that game when I'm thinking, you know, the classic examples of, you know, when you see Tetris, like, pieces and tiles of the bathroom and stuff that you've been playing a game so much."
3462.0,3463.0, Yes.
3463.0,3467.0," Well, I heard like, a noise that my door in the middle and I woke up."
3467.0,3473.0," And then I visualized myself laying minds at the front door, but in the interface of company here as a posing front."
3473.0,3477.0," Before I started laughing myself, I was like, what?"
3477.0,3478.0, It was like what?
3478.0,3480.0, It fucked the top of the game.
3480.0,3481.0, Now I think I'm being heroes.
3481.0,3482.0, Now I'm coming to you here.
3482.0,3483.0," Well, wow."
3483.0,3484.0, Obviously.
3484.0,3485.0, Final fantasy tactics.
3485.0,3486.0, Really?
3486.0,3487.0, I don't know why.
3487.0,3488.0, What was it about?
3488.0,3489.0, It was a bit frustrating.
3489.0,3490.0, Yeah.
3490.0,3491.0, I had dreams about the one.
3491.0,3492.0, Fricky.
3492.0,3493.0, Yeah.
3493.0,3494.0, Tetris was the classic.
3494.0,3495.0, Yeah.
3495.0,3496.0, This was falling from the sky.
3496.0,3502.0," And it was pretty easy to get that with luminous and puzzle games are really, you know, because it's nothing but staring at patterns for so long."
3502.0,3508.0," You get, you know, like even everyone point out, we have these chairs in our lobby here and they're exactly,"
3508.0,3512.0," kind of because the blocks shape and color, it will not the shape of the chain."
3512.0,3518.0," Well, they do goes between round and square, but their color patterns change with each level in luminous."
3518.0,3519.0, Mm-hmm.
3519.0,3523.0," Well, the chairs we have in our lobby are pieces from the game."
3523.0,3526.0," Like 100% you know, the red circle with the light box really fun."
3526.0,3529.0," And the reverse of that, I remember looked at those chairs that were fit."
3529.0,3532.0," Yeah, when they came out a lot of us pointed out, we'd be like, ah, true."
3532.0,3535.0," We just said, you know, you know, you know, obviously."
3535.0,3539.0," I don't have the visual stuff, but like, I don't like after playing like bow shot for way too long."
3539.0,3543.0," Whenever I hear like, you know that security alarm bell goes off, I was hearing that everywhere."
3543.0,3545.0, Think your hot pocket is done.
3545.0,3546.0, Exactly.
3546.0,3548.0, Do you know what I mean?
3548.0,3549.0, Do you know what I mean?
3549.0,3550.0, Yeah.
3550.0,3552.0," Ryan, you plan anything?"
3552.0,3555.0, I finally got around to plans and guild wars.
3555.0,3557.0, I have the north this week.
3557.0,3559.0," Oh, and how was that for you?"
3559.0,3563.0," Um, with a magical surprisingly brief."
3563.0,3564.0, It's probably brief.
3564.0,3567.0, I finally got around to kind of starting in on Saturday.
3567.0,3569.0, Did you say you played all weekend?
3569.0,3571.0, I played.
3571.0,3575.0," I didn't play like obsessively for like, you know, 16 hours a day per weekend."
3575.0,3576.0," Per weekend, everybody."
3576.0,3578.0, How many hours this weekend did you spend like?
3578.0,3581.0, Maybe eight hours a day.
3581.0,3582.0, Okay.
3582.0,3586.0, So I just want to just want to do a sandwich that's surprising not every night of the groundwork.
3586.0,3589.0, It means like I didn't quite need to break out the poop sod.
3589.0,3590.0, Okay.
3590.0,3591.0, You will.
3591.0,3592.0, Right.
3592.0,3594.0, So it's like eight being being pretty good.
3594.0,3595.0, Yeah.
3595.0,3597.0," I mean, like, that's my estimate anyway."
3597.0,3600.0," And this game is very, very, very short."
3600.0,3605.0," Um, I would say that the campaign content, which, you know, every guild"
3605.0,3611.0, worth game is sort of like a linear story that heavy start middle and end.
3611.0,3615.0, And you can finish this in a weekend.
3615.0,3616.0, I have a shared panel.
3616.0,3617.0," Oh, wow."
3617.0,3618.0, So you're done with the whole campaign.
3618.0,3619.0, Yeah.
3619.0,3621.0, Is it like reduced price?
3621.0,3625.0," I mean, is that like, well, the normal guild wars game is 50 bucks."
3625.0,3626.0, And this is 40.
3626.0,3630.0, Isn't this for high level campaign or no?
3630.0,3631.0, This is for established players only.
3631.0,3633.0, You have to have you have to already.
3633.0,3637.0, So we can't say you just ripped it because you're so good and your character is so powerful and mighty.
3637.0,3639.0, So it was actually four powerful characters.
3639.0,3640.0, It's actually for yeah.
3640.0,3643.0, It's like burning crusade.
3643.0,3645.0," Yeah, except a rather rich kingdom."
3645.0,3647.0," Or well, well, burning crusade."
3647.0,3648.0," Yeah, sure, sure."
3648.0,3656.0," But um, I would estimate the total amount of campaign content to be maybe about 25% of, like, a normal guild"
3656.0,3657.0, Wars game.
3657.0,3659.0," Oh, that's like a liberal estimation."
3659.0,3662.0," Then did you play like through everything, like, even only those stupid side effects and things?"
3662.0,3665.0," Well, that's the other side quests, you know, those are extra."
3665.0,3667.0, I haven't done a lot of that yet.
3667.0,3668.0, But what I have done.
3668.0,3669.0, Right.
3669.0,3670.0, You don't understand.
3670.0,3674.0, Is this expansion made for the player who enjoys twisting?
3674.0,3675.0, Oh.
3675.0,3676.0, Okay.
3676.0,3677.0, So I've heard you.
3677.0,3678.0, That's what you don't mean.
3678.0,3679.0, Yes.
3679.0,3682.0," I've heard you talk about, like, like, rep grind and yeah, yeah."
3682.0,3683.0, Wow.
3683.0,3690.0," And I assume that means you are trying to grind out, back to points with various people's in order to get rewards."
3690.0,3691.0, Correct.
3691.0,3695.0," Is this something you do not a weekend after you get burning crusade, but months after?"
3695.0,3702.0, That's pretty much what all the extra curricular content in Guild Wars is geared towards from what I can see.
3702.0,3708.0," Because you have, you know, instead of having, like, tons of skills for all of the different professions,"
3708.0,3714.0," they have, like, this, this set of, like, core, like, profession, neutral skills."
3714.0,3718.0, And those skills get better as you gain faction with all of these races.
3718.0,3724.0," And so, and, you know, it's, it's not, you know, you're not going to get your faction to the highest levels just by doing quest."
3724.0,3728.0," And then you're going to go out and kill monsters, kill more monsters."
3728.0,3735.0," Which wouldn't be so bad, it's up Guild Wars is established itself as being the MMO where you don't need to do that, right?"
3735.0,3737.0," Pretty much, yeah."
3737.0,3740.0," Yeah, that's, that it's very strange to see that in this game."
3740.0,3741.0, Right.
3741.0,3742.0," To, like, this extent."
3742.0,3748.0," But I remember last time when I saw it, they were talking about how the crux was, like, Dungeons, like, really deemed"
3748.0,3751.0, E-style Dungeon crawls with the way that a couching it is that?
3751.0,3757.0," The, the one interesting thing about the way the campaign flows is that they, they've kind of abandoned the whole, like,"
3757.0,3760.0, tiered reward structure of the different missions.
3760.0,3767.0," And they're just, they've replaced it with, like, these Dungeons that you just go through, you get, like, this static reward and you move on."
3767.0,3770.0," But, um, it's very, there's not a whole lot."
3770.0,3772.0, So you don't sound that thrilled.
3772.0,3775.0," It's, it's, it's kind of let me down."
3775.0,3778.0," Oh, it's, you're going to keep going."
3778.0,3779.0," Well, we'll see."
3779.0,3781.0, How many hours you have to do?
3781.0,3782.0, Total?
3782.0,3784.0, Sounds like what a Nate.
3784.0,3786.0, I don't know about that.
3786.0,3790.0," That's my food puffer for this, this is hard test."
3790.0,3793.0," We, we need to know you're still our, we need to know your score ahead of time."
3793.0,3797.0," I'll give you a range for the ex-cuser, you know, give me the range too."
3797.0,3799.0," Um, between, give me a range between, like, between nine and ten."
3799.0,3801.0, Between 8.9 and 9.2.
3801.0,3804.0," Yeah, which, which are you going to go for?"
3805.0,3809.0," And then the other thing, the other big thing about this expansion, this is one of the big, um,"
3809.0,3815.0," it's only points that they've made a big deal about all through its development is this, this location called the Hall of Monuments."
3815.0,3816.0," Yeah, yes."
3816.0,3822.0," Where, um, a sensible, this access, like, a gate between, Guild Wars 1 and Guild Wars 2 where you will be able to"
3822.0,3825.0, memorialize your items and accomplishments.
3825.0,3826.0, No doubt.
3826.0,3830.0," And then your, your Guild Wars 2 characters will get some sort of bonus based on that."
3830.0,3831.0, Uh-huh.
3831.0,3838.0," And in order to, to memorialize these things, like, you know, you can't just put your hero characters on this one monument."
3838.0,3845.0," You have to have ran through a bunch of the, um, extracurricular challenge missions over and over so you can get their armor upgrades."
3845.0,3847.0, Only then can you place them.
3847.0,3848.0, Uh-huh.
3848.0,3849.0, Uh-huh.
3849.0,3856.0," It's like grinding to exalted them only only the endgame weapons from, um, from this expansion, maybe added,"
3856.0,3859.0, not any of the ones you may have gathered before.
3859.0,3863.0," So it's like, there are all these, these barriers to using this thing."
3863.0,3868.0," Well, they want to make it, it's, it sounds like it's an extra perk for those who are like the most committed."
3868.0,3869.0, All right.
3869.0,3870.0," I mean, that."
3870.0,3874.0," But it's, it's like a monument to, to like your, your poop stocking."
3874.0,3875.0," John, to say, of course."
3875.0,3879.0," In our transition into the fact that you were, you were revealed to us earlier that your girlfriends"
3879.0,3881.0, trying to turn you into cosplayer.
3881.0,3884.0," That's, that's a, that's a pretty solid transition there."
3884.0,3885.0, Yeah.
3885.0,3886.0, Yeah.
3886.0,3887.0, Yeah.
3887.0,3888.0," So, you got a little bit of cosplayer."
3888.0,3889.0, Cosplayer comes.
3889.0,3890.0," You got poop stocking, dude."
3890.0,3891.0, They're like.
3891.0,3892.0," I guess, I guess."
3892.0,3894.0, Seably.
3894.0,3895.0," So what is this, right?"
3895.0,3896.0, You're becoming a cosplayer.
3896.0,3898.0," Oh, well, we were, we were talking about."
3898.0,3899.0, Renfer.
3899.0,3900.0," Well, that's, come on."
3900.0,3903.0," Well, it came up because this past weekend after I came back from GDC."
3903.0,3905.0," Oh, you saw Bill Roper's band play it."
3905.0,3906.0," Yeah, this is fair."
3906.0,3907.0," Bill Roper's band was, uh, the proxy,"
3907.0,3909.0, Bogger is playing it at Renfer.
3909.0,3912.0," So I happen to be driving, going, passing away back to San Francisco."
3912.0,3914.0, That's a damn coincidence right there.
3914.0,3917.0," Oh, no, he gave a, he gave us a, he gave us a hint."
3917.0,3918.0, What I give us the invite.
3918.0,3919.0, I spent on the weekend down.
3919.0,3920.0, It was a time coincidence.
3920.0,3922.0," It was just like, I'm not used to hearing the sentence like so."
3922.0,3924.0, I just had the red fair.
3924.0,3925.0, Yeah.
3925.0,3930.0," So we're filming over, we're happened to be, we're just having to be eating this turkey leg"
3930.0,3931.0, with my hands.
3931.0,3932.0," So, it's a film."
3932.0,3935.0," Bill Roper, the head of flagship studios and, uh,"
3935.0,3938.0, former Blizzard employee has his own band called The What?
3938.0,3942.0," Poxy Bogger's, Poxy Bogger's and what kind of music does he play?"
3942.0,3943.0," Uh, basically drinkin' tunes."
3943.0,3946.0," So they, they begun at 16th century drinkin' tunes."
3946.0,3949.0," Uh, yeah, kind of, but also kind of like, you know,"
3949.0,3952.0," basically you could use, you could go to any Irish bar today and"
3952.0,3955.0, they perform and we'd sound normal.
3955.0,3956.0," Uh, okay."
3956.0,3959.0," They kind of modify our, they dressed."
3959.0,3960.0," Uh, the Renfer again."
3960.0,3961.0, In period gear.
3961.0,3964.0," Actually, I got some pictures, which I'll be, I'll be happy to post on the,"
3964.0,3965.0," uh, GFW blog."
3965.0,3966.0, Put them up.
3966.0,3967.0, Okay.
3967.0,3968.0, Yep.
3968.0,3969.0, This is like little wager.
3969.0,3972.0, So you got Bill Roper in it and a killed one or something like that.
3972.0,3975.0," No, it was just not a kind of killed, but like, you know,"
3975.0,3976.0, it was a killed.
3976.0,3977.0, It was a killed spot.
3977.0,3978.0, It's a skirt.
3978.0,3980.0," No, no skirts, no skirts involved."
3980.0,3983.0, That's how we got to Ryan.
3983.0,3984.0, Yeah.
3984.0,3985.0, I'm faring.
3985.0,3986.0, Okay.
3986.0,3987.0," So Ryan, you were also at the Renfer."
3987.0,3988.0," Uh, I know."
3988.0,3990.0, It's okay if you were.
3990.0,3993.0," Although I have, I did, I did attend the last round there,"
3993.0,3994.0," but that, that's the truth."
3994.0,3996.0, That's very thread with you dude again.
3996.0,3997.0, Got.
3997.0,3999.0, So my girlfriend.
3999.0,4001.0, That's a wrong with Renfer.
4001.0,4004.0," My girlfriend likes Renfer and she, she's a seamstress."
4004.0,4006.0, So she's into the whole costume thing.
4006.0,4007.0, Uh huh.
4007.0,4010.0," So she's like, we should make you a costume for Renter."
4010.0,4014.0, Can I just ask this might be a little bit personal?
4014.0,4016.0, Let's just make sure we're clear here.
4016.0,4019.0," This, this isn't you at home and drag, right?"
4019.0,4020.0, When you say you're girlfriend.
4020.0,4021.0, Yeah.
4021.0,4022.0, Okay.
4022.0,4024.0," Oh, shit."
4024.0,4025.0," Oh, Jeff."
4025.0,4026.0, That was that nice.
4026.0,4027.0, Just one run.
4027.0,4028.0," Oh, I know."
4028.0,4029.0, I got him to open up.
4030.0,4032.0, I read trauma-type.
4032.0,4033.0, All right.
4033.0,4036.0," Dude, how are your Halloween that your girlfriend's a seamstress?"
4036.0,4038.0," Does she make you dress up and full,"
4038.0,4039.0, watch over Gilly every year?
4039.0,4040.0, Yeah.
4040.0,4041.0, Okay.
4041.0,4042.0," So she, that's normally,"
4042.0,4044.0, so back to your real girlfriend.
4044.0,4047.0," So she, I didn't mean to do air quotes for that."
4047.0,4052.0," Oh, she, uh, so she does see a seamstring for the Renfer,"
4052.0,4053.0, like every year or whatever.
4053.0,4055.0," I mean, she makes like her own costume."
4055.0,4056.0, I was like that.
4056.0,4057.0, Okay.
4057.0,4058.0, That's cool.
4058.0,4061.0," She, she's trying to get me to."
4061.0,4063.0, And go and watch what we're doing.
4063.0,4064.0, What would she dress you up as?
4064.0,4066.0, I really don't know.
4066.0,4068.0, You want you to ask her?
4068.0,4069.0, Yeah.
4069.0,4071.0, You got to communicate better if you got to.
4071.0,4072.0, You got to relate to something.
4072.0,4073.0, Get some.
4073.0,4074.0," Yeah, yes."
4074.0,4075.0, Did you know?
4075.0,4076.0, Did not like she said that to you.
4076.0,4078.0, You didn't say like what?
4078.0,4081.0," Well, I just kind of, well,"
4081.0,4082.0, I have to think of something.
4082.0,4084.0, You must have said something.
4084.0,4087.0," Like, I don't really see you as a,"
4087.0,4091.0, you played Guild Wars a weekend putting the fucking diaper on for your girlfriends.
4091.0,4093.0," Not my, I still put food."
4093.0,4094.0, You're not laughing.
4094.0,4096.0, You're not dressing up as an orc.
4096.0,4098.0," You're just like wearing, you know, your temperament's clothing."
4098.0,4099.0, Right.
4099.0,4100.0, Right.
4100.0,4101.0, Right.
4101.0,4105.0," Renaissance dudes like leggings and, I don't know."
4105.0,4107.0," But you know, she, you know,"
4107.0,4108.0, Renaissance clothes.
4108.0,4110.0," The renferers is soon, so she, you know,"
4110.0,4112.0, her family's family a geek.
4112.0,4114.0, So that's kind of right there.
4114.0,4115.0, You're literally traditionally.
4115.0,4116.0, So I think you should do this.
4116.0,4117.0, I'd like to take photos.
4117.0,4119.0," I'm just visualizing Elvira Cambridge,"
4119.0,4122.0, because like that's what the renferer like outfits are all about.
4122.0,4124.0," Elvira Creer, that's us the men."
4124.0,4125.0, Yeah.
4125.0,4129.0," Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."
4129.0,4130.0, It is.
4130.0,4132.0," I dressed up for a friend's Renaissance wedding,"
4132.0,4134.0," the like, ah, that kind of count."
4134.0,4136.0," Yeah, Renaissance wedding."
4136.0,4138.0, I've got a staff in everything.
4138.0,4139.0, Wow.
4139.0,4141.0, So did they talk that way?
4141.0,4142.0, Like when they were doing their vows?
4142.0,4144.0," Oh, easy wed, oh, flat wedch."
4144.0,4145.0, Was it like that kind of thing?
4145.0,4147.0, like that kind of thing close.
4147.0,4148.0, It's like that.
4148.0,4150.0," But there's people in my,"
4150.0,4154.0," outfits, there's like a walk underneath cross swords and stuff like that."
4154.0,4155.0, Wow.
4155.0,4156.0, Beautiful.
4156.0,4157.0, It's like a ride a wow wedding.
4157.0,4159.0," It's totally a wow wedding, but really."
4159.0,4161.0, And they're the coolest people in the universe.
4161.0,4162.0, That's cool.
4162.0,4165.0," I can't, can't mock the Ren's fair thing."
4165.0,4166.0, Yeah.
4166.0,4167.0, Some good shit.
4167.0,4168.0, Yeah.
4168.0,4169.0, I've been the Ren fairs.
4169.0,4171.0," You could spice up your life a little bit with that, right?"
4171.0,4172.0," Yeah, Ben."
4172.0,4173.0, And that brings the Ren fair.
4173.0,4174.0," See you, Sven."
4174.0,4180.0," Next you can only problem with Ren fair now as opposed to back and my gay is that now you got lights of a,"
4180.0,4182.0, there's like a big goth crossover.
4182.0,4183.0, Yeah.
4183.0,4185.0, That they wasn't going on as a vampire shit.
4185.0,4186.0, Yeah.
4186.0,4187.0," The foot, they don't,"
4187.0,4188.0, I did notice one thing over the weekend.
4188.0,4189.0," They were, they were guys like,"
4189.0,4190.0, We have roof.
4190.0,4191.0, Yeah.
4191.0,4194.0," No, they were, they were guys like ignoring the basic roles."
4194.0,4197.0, If there were any and like some dude dressed up as a cling on some dude.
4197.0,4198.0, Yeah.
4198.0,4199.0, So yeah.
4199.0,4200.0, So yeah.
4200.0,4201.0, So yeah.
4201.0,4203.0, Some guy dressed up as link and no one is Zelda.
4203.0,4204.0, It just becomes an excuse.
4204.0,4205.0, Yeah.
4205.0,4207.0, Because there's like obviously there's no local comic runs.
4207.0,4210.0," So they're just like, let's go fucking crash the Ren fair."
4210.0,4211.0, Holy shit.
4211.0,4212.0, I have the suit in my closet.
4212.0,4213.0, I could put this on this weekend.
4213.0,4215.0," They should be playing on their like, so it's like, well,"
4215.0,4216.0, are you doing it?
4216.0,4217.0," He's like, leprosy."
4217.0,4218.0, Ha ha ha.
4218.0,4221.0, They did have like a no cling on sign up front.
4221.0,4223.0, You can't come in if you have a cling.
4223.0,4224.0, Leave if you're me.
4224.0,4225.0, Explain that to me.
4225.0,4227.0, Since it was such a fucking failure.
4227.0,4230.0, That the cling on was trying to pretend he was a leopard.
4230.0,4231.0, I got it.
4231.0,4232.0, All right.
4233.0,4234.0," Oh, oh."
4234.0,4236.0, It should stick to fucking milk duds.
4236.0,4237.0, Hey.
4237.0,4239.0, I thought it was funny.
4239.0,4242.0, I just think that I was morally outrage to the coming on.
4242.0,4244.0, What show up at a Ren fair.
4244.0,4245.0, Yeah.
4245.0,4246.0, What did you do?
4246.0,4247.0, Did you do this to start trick?
4247.0,4248.0, He dressed up.
4248.0,4249.0, Yeah.
4249.0,4250.0, They probably did.
4250.0,4251.0, Better than you.
4251.0,4252.0," Well, I'm sure that's happened to me with the Hollywood."
4252.0,4253.0, You're right.
4253.0,4254.0, Last time I went to a Ren fair.
4254.0,4255.0, I was not dressed up.
4255.0,4257.0, Went through the trouble of taping some latex on this forehead.
4257.0,4259.0, You're right.
4259.0,4260.0, Mm-hmm.
4260.0,4261.0, I feel bad now.
4261.0,4262.0, Yeah.
4262.0,4263.0, So silenced in the podcast.
4263.0,4268.0, Now I played some some hard team fortress 2 and left for dead.
4268.0,4269.0, Did you last.
4269.0,4271.0," Well, why did we open the podcast with this?"
4271.0,4272.0, This is big PC news.
4272.0,4273.0, Thanks.
4273.0,4274.0, We're already talked a little bit.
4274.0,4277.0," Well, you know, I talked about the first segment of the one-up show."
4277.0,4278.0, But that was like before.
4278.0,4279.0, I see.
4279.0,4282.0," I went and played it again for like, yeah, had it's, you know, usual."
4282.0,4284.0, What gamers dare something like that.
4284.0,4285.0, So.
4285.0,4286.0, I see.
4286.0,4288.0, Since you talked about it on the one side.
4288.0,4290.0, Apparently it's not good enough for JFW radio.
4290.0,4291.0," No, it's not."
4291.0,4292.0, And that's what I'm talking about it now.
4292.0,4293.0, You got me.
4293.0,4294.0," You got it wrong, Jeff."
4294.0,4295.0, Okay.
4295.0,4296.0," Oh, by the way."
4296.0,4309.0, I heard on one of yours this week that one of those one of yours are said that the half-life story was like a ex files fan fiction.
4309.0,4310.0, Yeah.
4310.0,4312.0, I'm not even going to defend that because I don't like.
4312.0,4313.0, I really don't think that's.
4313.0,4314.0, Get into it with us.
4314.0,4317.0," When we talk about the story for any game being good, it's always a relative or more."
4317.0,4322.0," Yeah, I'm saying like when you're talking about like a third grade class saying they're good at basketball or something."
4322.0,4325.0," Oh, you know, I mean, you mean for the third grade class."
4325.0,4326.0, Right.
4326.0,4330.0," And there's no doubt about it that yeah, like half-life's not art their Clark or whatever, you know."
4330.0,4334.0, But the problem I had with that is that I'm almost.
4334.0,4336.0, Fucking positive.
4336.0,4337.0, Shayna hasn't played.
4337.0,4340.0," If you take some of half-life one, he hasn't even touched half-life, too."
4340.0,4341.0, And that's the rad part.
4341.0,4342.0, We're calling you out.
4342.0,4343.0, So now.
4343.0,4346.0," But that's cool because like I make fun of like, you know, what is that?"
4346.0,4349.0," Damn story with that, that, that, that, that, that, that,"
4349.0,4353.0," Namco RPG that's got all the, the German subtitles."
4353.0,4354.0, So see now.
4354.0,4355.0, Yeah.
4355.0,4356.0, So I was in a soccer.
4356.0,4357.0, See no wankery.
4357.0,4358.0, Like I'll make fun of that.
4358.0,4359.0, And I've never played it.
4359.0,4360.0, Right.
4360.0,4361.0," You know, but all admit that."
4361.0,4367.0," I'll say like, hey, this is another way of saying I'm making fun of like how do she the names are and stuff and like trying, you know, the themes that they're trying to do."
4367.0,4369.0, You should collect examples of stories.
4369.0,4370.0, Think that.
4370.0,4371.0," Well, it's actually, you don't, you don't."
4371.0,4372.0, Yeah.
4372.0,4373.0, It was exactly.
4373.0,4374.0, Yeah.
4374.0,4377.0," I think it's not like, you don't play in a soccer because you actually watch the whole game."
4377.0,4378.0," Yeah, you just watch."
4378.0,4380.0," It's like, it's like, it's like, it's like a half hour casting."
4380.0,4381.0, And I think that's it.
4381.0,4382.0, I've seen the pictures.
4382.0,4384.0, It's more of that penoshit from the face.
4384.0,4385.0, Yeah.
4385.0,4386.0, It's straight up.
4386.0,4387.0, It's more like little girls.
4387.0,4388.0," Like, Google's a robot."
4388.0,4389.0, Okay.
4389.0,4390.0, That's cool.
4390.0,4391.0, sexy robot.
4391.0,4392.0, Now I can tap it.
4392.0,4394.0," Like I mean, let's go a robot with a cleavage."
4394.0,4395.0," No, I have yours."
4395.0,4397.0," No, but it's not you."
4397.0,4398.0, Okay.
4398.0,4399.0, My bad.
4399.0,4401.0," Um, so yeah."
4401.0,4402.0, That.
4402.0,4403.0, Yeah.
4403.0,4404.0, I'm not playing a little half life too.
4404.0,4405.0, And back on back on target.
4405.0,4406.0, Yeah.
4406.0,4407.0," Um, the left for dead."
4407.0,4411.0," I'll try to do some, you know, real quick about some monologue and blah, forever."
4411.0,4415.0, But left for dead is this fun as it's ever been.
4415.0,4416.0," You know, the past few times I played it."
4416.0,4417.0, I think Sean Darren.
4417.0,4420.0," I'm, you guys have all tried it at one point or another."
4420.0,4421.0, Yeah.
4421.0,4422.0, Yeah.
4422.0,4423.0, Awesome.
4423.0,4424.0, The funny thing is I'm playing the same level all these times.
4424.0,4428.0," And you know, the game's got like, I don't know, like five missions or something."
4428.0,4431.0, And what's awesome is that they're completely replayable.
4431.0,4436.0," And it does have the feel of a multiplayer game where you're like, it's, it's about the experience of playing through it."
4436.0,4444.0," And the things that happen when I'm, you know, with other people, other live players and a few of the enemies are, you know, also human control."
4444.0,4445.0," Um, and that's awesome."
4445.0,4452.0," I'm still skeptical about the role of, uh, played me infected, you know, the boss infected the four classes that you can choose."
4452.0,4460.0," Because it's very much like the way that crossing, um, from our cane studios and also, you know, using source engine sounds."
4460.0,4468.0," It's really a game about being the four human people, the four human players and everything else is you're just sort of there to facilitate their experience."
4468.0,4471.0," So that means challenging them, but not whipping the rest."
4471.0,4473.0," Uh, if you can't win."
4473.0,4478.0," Yeah. I mean, well, for what, yeah, because it's kind of like the whole point of the game is for the humans to get through the level."
4478.0,4485.0," And if you're just, if it's just some like even, you know, it's not so caliber where you need them to be like, you know, a, a symmetrically balanced with you."
4485.0,4488.0," You know, they, you need to whip their ass if you're a human with the gun."
4488.0,4501.0," So the thing is, is getting in the mentality of saying, okay, that's fine. I want to play this role where I'm, I'm playing a role, you know, harassing people and maybe spending a whole lot of time spawning in and knowing that I, I can do some things."
4501.0,4508.0," I mean, because people did get to jump on me. I mean, Valve had some of their employees, you know, whatever playing the infected there and they did some great stuff."
4508.0,4515.0," They got to drop on me repeatedly. One of the smokers, which has the long tongue, grabbed me from the other side of this car."
4515.0,4522.0," And it pulled me up against the side of the car and he couldn't, it's like it wasn't strong enough to drag me over the roof of the car, but it meant I'll stuck against the side."
4522.0,4528.0," And I couldn't do anything until my teammates came and shot him, but that allowed all the AI zombies to rush me and chew the shit out of me."
4528.0,4537.0," So while the guy doing that didn't get to kill like he gets points like me, for every time you hurt someone on that side. So you feel like you, it's worth your time, you get points."
4537.0,4542.0," But yeah, it'll be interesting. I think a lot more people are going to want to play the humans than they are the other."
4542.0,4547.0," I think playing Marco Polo, you know, it's a great game to play as long as you're not the fool with this fucking ice close."
4547.0,4554.0," I think Marco Polo, you know, but that I have high hopes for the game is a lot of fun."
4554.0,4562.0," Team Fortress is a played with a controller, which was a weird switch between Leftford and that's great when you go like in that proximity in one room."
4562.0,4569.0, You go from playing with the mouse and keyboard to playing with controller and both games that were originally designed for controllers.
4570.0,4574.0," And just being like, wow, I'm like hopeless with this thing."
4574.0,4584.0," But it wasn't just me, you know, I was actually like, for the competition there was doing well, but half life two, I mean, team Fortress two, I'm really excited for it. I can't wait."
4584.0,4588.0, I have a feeling a lot of us are going to be playing it this week.
4588.0,4593.0," Maybe by the time this podcast out, you will be playing it."
4593.0,4608.0," But I have my lingering concerns and this is another one of those reasons about why I think it's, it's wise to take time with the game rather than, you know, just playing it for a little bit and coming up with some kind of authoritative or, you know, that's air quotes, a thought data assessment of it."
4608.0,4620.0," Is that I think that, you know, we've talked about it over and over again, the fact that the grenades are gone that you can't comp jump and stuff and mention, but it's not just that it's, you know, fainting death has a spy was really fun and it's definitely taking that out."
4620.0,4627.0," This isn't make the game any better really. I mean, from the font, from strictly from the fun level, take a side balance or whatever other issues."
4627.0,4635.0," Because it's great when you go in, because, you know, in this was funny too, and the environment we're playing is mainly console people. They're not used to the series."
4635.0,4641.0, They don't know about it. So it was great. It's like spies delight. You just go in their base and why is this dude stabbing me?
4641.0,4646.0, It's like the just team killer. Don't worry about it. Just die. Just keep getting all of them that way.
4646.0,4654.0," But of course, on the PC, everyone knows to do a spy check on everyone. Every time you see a teammate that's running their own way, you shoot him as fucking face."
4654.0,4661.0," And then you shoot him again. And then if it's a teammate, you go, sorry bro, go find a med station."
4661.0,4670.0," So you need to faint death. You need all these other things because people are wise. And so you need to go to the, to the battlements, wherever, and this isn't even the, the, the best example."
4670.0,4677.0," But a bridge or something risky where corpses traditionally are, wherever everyone just sniper bodies pile up or, you know, soldiers on a bridge and stuff."
4677.0,4684.0, And then when the HWRIMS buy you lumber's buy you all slow and then you rise up from the ground and stab him in the ass.
4684.0,4698.0," So that's the fun. And I really, I do want to, I want to see if they're substitutes for it. It's not like I do not believe, you know, and I clarified my perspective many times that this is from like a very diehard team fortress classic player."
4698.0,4702.0, I don't expect the game to be team fortress classic. I understand it's going to be different.
4702.0,4719.0," But I do hope that all the things that made it fun are back in some shape or another. So it's like, while I don't need to have a concussion jump, I want to have something, some other skill set that I can master and that the game gives more the more I put into it that way."
4719.0,4734.0, Those were really important for the longevity of the game. The other concern is that they also help differentiate all the classes. And that's like one of their key things this time around. They want visually they're also striking yourself from the silhouette from the animations and everything.
4734.0,4748.0," And also from the weapon set. This is this class and this is what he does. But so because there are some overlap, you know, where the medic could be offensive and he was supposed to be a support class because he had a shotgun in the smoke building and stuff. Now let's pare him down and make sure he's basically just like,"
4748.0,4755.0," yeah, the ghostbuster gun that shoots out of it now instead of, you know, sucks up ghosts or whatever."
4755.0,4764.0," But the danger here, you know, where I'm going with this is the dangers that you have because now people are used to playing games like Halo and something where they're not class based."
4764.0,4771.0," And you have the ability to walk around and map and pick up different weapons and different tools and you have a wide, you know, skill set that's available to you from the get go."
4771.0,4780.0," So in pairing down the classes in team fortress of concern and I think this will probably really be the case for some at least for some of the console critics is like, well,"
4780.0,4787.0," why is there an HWG? And Halo 3, I can just go pick up a turret. Why is there a demo man? I just go pick up the brute shot."
4787.0,4795.0," You know, why is there a soldier like why is I just pick up the rocket or the main plane throw or right or all of the game."
4796.0,4816.0," It is, but I mean, that's a point to have though, because people are like, well, I like to experience where I'm basically playing all these and switching, not even just between deaths, but just like with the weapons, but hey, I've got, I've got the demo man on my back and I've got the HWG in my hands right now, I could drop that switch over to trigger two of these things."
4816.0,4836.0," But so also part of the challenge, those just that getting those roles and like doing performing, you know, they're duty well just being, you know, getting, getting used to it and doing stuff, but again, it's important just classic none of the scenario I just described now was an issue at all for me, because all the secondary attributes gave it so much variety, the medic infecting enemies,"
4836.0,4850.0," and everything is they ran into their spawns and spread the kudies to their entire team, which would have been classic on Xbox, you know, because it would have been like whatever year it was all over again when, you know, people didn't understand the mechanics of the game, it's just amazing to mess with them."
4850.0,4855.0," Or, you know, I mean, just all the other, all the other stuff that went with it, so we will see."
4856.0,4876.0," But I do know I have fun every time I play it, even with the controller, it's got so much spirit and like when you play it, even taking aside the fact that I know that I'm like, okay, this is like dust bowl, like this is a red map, I know like exactly how it works and stuff, it's like it's, it's really fun to play so far, but I'm concerned about the longevity we'll see."
4876.0,4882.0," And mods, you know, on PC side, I, I guess you know, people are going to mod the stuff immediately."
4882.0,4894.0," There are already probably, you know, talking about getting their old clients back together and they're like, okay, well, first thing we're going to do is we'll just use the, the asset for one of the demo man's grenades and we'll turn that into a conk."
4894.0,4898.0, And we'll just figure out how to code with the physics to turn that into that.
4898.0,4910.0," Not put the game back, restore to its old state, but say, okay, well, maybe this class is little boring. Let's give him a fri grenade and just him and him alone, you know, so it'll be interesting. There will be tons of options. I'm not worried about that."
4910.0,4916.0," So yeah, both definitely both the, well, sure, we'll keep talking about it on the podcast and in the magazine."
4916.0,4923.0," And it's the article, so it's the mods. You hate it. Like I said, this week, we could, could all be playing a whole lot of it. So that would be good."
4923.0,4926.0, I'll roll on PC at last to yay.
4926.0,4928.0, Woohoo.
4928.0,4932.0, So you guys don't want to talk to me.
4932.0,4934.0," Why, why wouldn't we want to talk to you anymore?"
4934.0,4937.0," And it's playing where I'll quite. Are we, is that mean we're done?"
4937.0,4939.0," Yeah, that was a, we're not in there in the hall."
4939.0,4940.0, Yeah.
4940.0,4942.0," Ryan, you got anything more first."
4942.0,4944.0," Have you guys, are looking at your belly buttons?"
4944.0,4945.0, No.
4946.0,4948.0," No, I don't."
4948.0,4952.0, Will you tell us more about your upcoming cosplay?
4952.0,4953.0, Transformation.
4953.0,4955.0, I don't have a cosplay transformation.
4955.0,4958.0," If it happens, you know, cosplay transformation."
4958.0,4960.0," If you're going to, yeah, that's not bad."
4960.0,4965.0," There's a lot of men who will go to like, you know, go to like Fredrick's a Hollywood or something."
4965.0,4968.0," They'll say, hey, man, look at this vampire outfit or nurse thing."
4968.0,4969.0, I'm going to buy this for my lady.
4969.0,4973.0," They take a home and they're like, and this is when you guys go, oh, shit."
4973.0,4976.0," They're just telling us the story of him is on life, but I'm not."
4976.0,4979.0," Oh, so you got you, you know, yeah, you baby, you got to try this on."
4979.0,4981.0," I mean, this will just be fun."
4981.0,4984.0, And those ladies are like slapping that shit at their hand.
4984.0,4985.0, I will not to grade myself that way.
4985.0,4987.0," You got a lady who's like, fuck that."
4987.0,4989.0," Don't, why, I don't want you wasting your money on make it."
4989.0,4992.0," What do you want me to, you need to be with that."
4992.0,4993.0, Usually it's the other way around.
4993.0,4995.0," I come home and I'm like, I don't have to break that."
4995.0,4998.0," Has bought me like a fireman outfit or something, you know, cowboy."
4998.0,4999.0," Yeah, same here too."
4999.0,5002.0," Like, yeah, cowboy or some of the other classics."

5008.0,5011.0, You hang your zone in the elephant trunk.
5011.0,5013.0," Okay, that shit's interactive."
5013.0,5016.0, We've hit rock bottom here.
5016.0,5019.0," You don't always say that, but that we can go lower."
5019.0,5020.0, That's what people want.
5020.0,5021.0, That's what they need.
5021.0,5023.0," Hey, yeah, I wanted to put this challenge out too."
5023.0,5025.0," Yeah, the hot challenge."
5025.0,5027.0," Like, if you listen to this piece of crap show,"

5139.0,5141.0," Yeah, there's a story for that."
5141.0,5144.0," There is a, I knew some fool in grad school who had that CD."
5144.0,5146.0, Like I got him to admit that he had it.
5146.0,5148.0," And then not only that, he said he DJed a wedding,"
5148.0,5149.0, and he played that shit.
5149.0,5150.0," Hey, what song?"
5150.0,5151.0, That.
5151.0,5152.0, Hey.
5152.0,5153.0, Hey.
5153.0,5154.0, Hey.
5154.0,5155.0, Hey.
5155.0,5156.0, He asked.
5156.0,5157.0, Or that shit.
5157.0,5159.0, But imagine playing that.
5159.0,5160.0," Like, what do you think of you?"
5160.0,5161.0," Like, all right, the all goth wedding."
