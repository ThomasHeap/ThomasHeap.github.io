0.0,6.0," Hello, and welcome to GFW Radio."
6.0,7.0," Thanks, Sean."
7.0,12.0," It's March 4th, 2008, not enough for posting it that day."
12.0,14.0, I don't really care.
14.0,19.0," It's Jeff Grinney and Edron Chief of GFW, and Ryan Scott is not with us today."
19.0,21.0, There's an empty chair there for him.
21.0,24.0," So somewhere around the 45 minute mark, someone has to say something"
24.0,28.0," just like super like bitter and snarky, and then it'll take care of Ryan's weekly contribution."
28.0,29.0, What the hell?
29.0,32.0," I had a bag of gummy bears in his honor, though."
32.0,35.0," Oh, and I even actually, he is here in spirit today."
35.0,38.0, I had to shake the shit out of the snack machine to get it to come out.
38.0,39.0," Oh, really?"
39.0,40.0," Yeah, I had to pull us."
40.0,43.0," Did you do the full on pounding on the floor thing that he does or that whole,"
43.0,44.0, shaking the floor?
44.0,46.0, It's a great time machine to shake the floor.
46.0,47.0," Yeah, didn't hear anything, so it must not have been all over."
47.0,48.0, Because you were down here.
48.0,49.0, Ryan assault.
49.0,50.0," Oh, that was just now."
50.0,51.0," Oh, to get the gummy bears."
51.0,52.0, Right before we came in.
52.0,54.0," Oh, you were completely inhabited by Ryan Scott."
54.0,55.0, Yeah.
55.0,56.0, Ryan is the same food crazy.
56.0,61.0," It's kind of like, uh, old Desmond on the last."
61.0,64.0, And now you're really Ryan's right.
64.0,67.0, We've got the most fucked up candy machine.
67.0,69.0, Like nothing works here at this place.
69.0,71.0," Everything's like, we're at this major media company."
71.0,75.0," You think everyone always, I hate when people write like, well, obviously, you can play"
75.0,78.0," crisis because you've got a $6,000 PC."
78.0,80.0," It's like, oh, no, I doubt mine."
80.0,82.0, Mine's like one step above like a 486.
83.0,86.0," In fact, I won't waste a time in the podcast, but we're actually still waiting."
86.0,91.0, We're seriously still waiting for our 2007 equipment to come in for GFW.
91.0,92.0, I got mine.
92.0,93.0," Yeah, you got yours."
93.0,94.0, I never got mine.
94.0,96.0, I never got my 2007 PC.
96.0,98.0, So the last thing to know about Ryan in this neck machine is lately.
98.0,105.0," Yeah, he's gotten himself a role of a, of thick transparent tape that's about like two inches wide."
105.0,108.0, And he takes a three foot long strip two strips of these.
108.0,111.0, And he takes them up to a dollar bill.
111.0,115.0, So that he basically got a like a three foot clear lead on the dollar bill.
115.0,120.0, And we run it into the snack machine and then hit coin return and then pull back out and continue your feet.
120.0,123.0," So he's got, I don't know, he at least got like $7."
123.0,125.0, Quarter's that other thing.
125.0,128.0, That was believing you.
128.0,132.0, He's also the guy who tapes up notes angry notes all over the thing.
132.0,133.0, Dear snack guy.
133.0,136.0, You're the guy who tells that same story every week.
136.0,137.0, I do.
137.0,138.0, Yeah.
138.0,139.0, I got all quiet.
139.0,141.0, I meant that in those was we fun.
141.0,146.0, There was a mode of con with a colon colon in a capital P.
146.0,151.0," So, uh, so we got Anthony Gallagos back."
151.0,152.0, I Anthony.
152.0,153.0, Hello.
153.0,155.0, Sean and Sean.
155.0,157.0, So I didn't make you introduce yourself because last week.
157.0,159.0," You go, what do I have to do that?"
159.0,160.0, Just happen naturally.
160.0,161.0, You remember that.
161.0,162.0, I did.
162.0,163.0, I did.
163.0,164.0, I did.
164.0,165.0, I brought it up.
165.0,166.0, Right up.
166.0,167.0, I'm going to tell you.
167.0,168.0, That would be radif.
168.0,173.0," If a listener would go and compile like all the instances of, of or even me."
173.0,174.0, I don't say that.
174.0,178.0," So we have like every, maybe there's like."
178.0,179.0, I'm out together.
179.0,180.0, A good 40.
180.0,181.0," Well, obviously you never say that."
181.0,182.0," Well, no, no."
182.0,183.0," Well, that's exempt."
183.0,185.0, But I mean like specifics.
185.0,187.0, Like the story of Ryan in the snack machine.
187.0,190.0, So maybe we have like 45 minutes of you.
190.0,192.0, Do it alternate versions of Ryan.
192.0,193.0, The same at God damn thing.
193.0,195.0, That's sort of like the way we inducted.
195.0,198.0," Well, right into the Hall of Fame like three different times."
198.0,199.0, He did.
199.0,200.0, Yeah.
200.0,201.0," Oh, God."
201.0,203.0, He's just that good.
203.0,204.0, He didn't mind.
204.0,205.0," Hey, he didn't mind."
205.0,206.0, But here it is again.
206.0,207.0, Keep in touch.
207.0,209.0," Speaking of which, I'm going to do a segue here."
209.0,212.0, Speaking of celebrity game developers.
212.0,214.0, Gary Guygex.
214.0,215.0, Oh.
215.0,216.0, Rest in peace.
216.0,217.0, For Mr. Guygex.
217.0,218.0, He just died today.
218.0,221.0, I got a call from ABC news.
221.0,224.0, Like an hour before we went on wanting a comment on it.
225.0,227.0, Which actually thought was kind of cool.
227.0,229.0, Don't you think did you give one like David notice?
229.0,230.0," Yeah, I did."
230.0,231.0," Well, yeah."
231.0,233.0, I said who the fuck see?
233.0,234.0, No.
234.0,235.0, I know.
235.0,238.0," No, I thought that was cool that they that they cared enough."
238.0,240.0, Did they say what it's going to run?
240.0,242.0," No, they didn't."
242.0,246.0," It'll come after whatever latest, you know, car."
246.0,248.0," Whatever latest, you know,"
248.0,250.0, a saw of what it did.
250.0,251.0, The following that you kind of.
251.0,253.0, I can't talk fuck this.
254.0,255.0, How about this?
255.0,258.0, It's been like a huge sea change in public attitude toward it.
258.0,261.0, Because I remember when I was when I was like grade school.
261.0,264.0, And you could go to like Bible study on the weekend.
264.0,266.0, They would be telling us about how.
266.0,269.0," You know, you got to stay away from this because it's a devil's work."
269.0,275.0," But it's it's not just his work, but it's also an outlet for the devil to enter your life."
275.0,277.0, They tell us stories of kids down in the basement.
277.0,279.0, There's they were dead serious.
279.0,280.0, I don't know where they got.
280.0,283.0," They're saying all of a sudden, you know, they're in this long like, you know,"
283.0,286.0, D&D session and one would stand up and out stretch his arms on either side.
286.0,288.0, And then they roll up like carpets.
288.0,290.0, If there were no bones bones in them.
290.0,292.0, He'll just shit.
292.0,294.0," You know, and then they was like roll back out."
294.0,296.0, Like imagine those party whistles.
296.0,300.0, So that is what happened to us.
300.0,302.0, But that would share the shit out of me.
302.0,303.0, They would tell us that.
303.0,305.0, They would tell us that tracked straight up.
305.0,306.0, Yeah.
306.0,307.0, So I was that was the devil dude.
307.0,309.0, I was going to leave us to Satan now with Gary guy.
309.0,310.0," Yeah, I was dead."
310.0,316.0," This is not going to be a good thing, but I was I was the founder of the role playing club in high school."
316.0,318.0, And I went to a Catholic high school.
318.0,320.0, So that was like a really big deal.
320.0,326.0," Like what the principal, because I was like putting up posters and had like the head some image of like a stairway"
326.0,329.0," Sending into stars and he would be going to big talk about me about like,"
329.0,332.0, I think that might be construed as a ascension into heaven.
332.0,336.0," And this, you know, and then it started went into the, you know, we think this is demonic."
336.0,337.0, Wow.
337.0,338.0, And all sorts of stuff.
338.0,339.0, It was run.
339.0,340.0, It was a monster.
340.0,341.0," Yeah, you said the stairway going down."
341.0,342.0, That you would be cool.
342.0,344.0, To part for me and ever knew you.
344.0,345.0, Yeah.
345.0,346.0, Yeah.
346.0,347.0, Still in your mind.
347.0,352.0," You know, it should not come as a surprise if anybody in this whole game group comes out."
352.0,353.0, That's a D&D player.
353.0,354.0," I mean, come on."
354.0,356.0," Well, who we are."
356.0,358.0, I'm not saying that is cooler now.
358.0,361.0," I just like, I told you why that was that's been more nerdier."
361.0,362.0, What's better?
362.0,363.0," No, that's pretty nerdier."
363.0,364.0, You were like rebel dude.
364.0,366.0," Oh, you're like telling your priest straight up."
366.0,367.0," Hey, I'm going to explain."
367.0,368.0, I'm going to explain.
368.0,371.0, I'm taking fucking the five other students with me.
371.0,381.0," Actually, what I said in TABC News and I, and I blogged about it too was said that I really think like everything would be totally different without him."
381.0,383.0," I mean, it would be like Desmond going back."
383.0,385.0, It would be a lot less neckbeards in the world.
385.0,393.0," But I mean, think of all of the, all the dorks who grew up playing D&D, who then went on to be game designers through."
393.0,399.0," In modern RPGs, computer RPGs came from D&D, you know, and then did it."
399.0,406.0, And then modern computer RPGs influence game designs and other genres and then all this influence movies and TV.
406.0,409.0," I mean, there's you practicing your soundbites for ABC."
409.0,410.0, I am.
410.0,411.0, I'm repeating it.
411.0,412.0, I like it.
412.0,413.0, It's a good one.
413.0,420.0," You think role playing wouldn't have come around in the same capacity of Gary Guy, getting excited in there."
420.0,422.0, It would have come to the budget is where we need death.
422.0,425.0, To your peak that it would have come from the sexual community.
425.0,427.0, The furries.
427.0,429.0," Yeah, it's a role playing, like role playing."
429.0,439.0," Like in the movie Treckys, how the, the couple that runs the, the dental office, the husband will dress up like for get her name, the ship's counselor and then the wife will dress up like data."
439.0,440.0, Counselor Troy.
440.0,442.0," Yeah, counselor Troy and data."
442.0,443.0, That's role.
443.0,445.0," Well, it, yeah, I guess it probably would happen."
445.0,449.0," There wouldn't be, the exterior intelligence would be like libido and Venus."
449.0,454.0, Let me roll.
454.0,455.0, Let me roll.
455.0,457.0, We'll do the role.
457.0,458.0, Make a lot of sad.
458.0,461.0, That's it.
461.0,464.0, Everyone would have the overwhelmingly large penis score though.
464.0,467.0, I'm plus far.
467.0,469.0," So anyway, so he passed away that set."
469.0,473.0," I do remember it in, in my, well, I was probably older youth at that point."
473.0,476.0," The whole big, when D&D was the big, you know,"
477.0,481.0, the big bookie man thing. I remember all the urban legends of the dude who died.
481.0,484.0," Well, it was like in Boston or something, right?"
484.0,489.0, It was like some urban legend of somebody's going to know who's listening and hopefully we'll post.
489.0,498.0," But about guys having a D&D session in Boston and like, you know, ending up in the sewer system and dying or getting eaten by rats or something."
498.0,500.0, There's some missed out.
500.0,501.0, Some origin legend of it.
501.0,502.0, Herbit legend.
502.0,504.0," Was, uh, it's been all sorts of urban legend."
505.0,506.0, Jack Thompson.
506.0,508.0, Chasing those dragons back then.
508.0,509.0, Yeah.
509.0,511.0, I don't have to get Jack Thompson's word on this.
511.0,515.0," You know, it has elsewhere died and this is all just like."
515.0,518.0, He's been better ever since.
518.0,521.0, I'm going to provide it in permanent kind of transition.
521.0,524.0, I expect you in the future if you're going to continue to join our show.
524.0,525.0, And that's it.
525.0,526.0, You wouldn't have had the weekend.
526.0,528.0," You just had, if not for Gary guy, guys."
528.0,529.0, It's true.
529.0,531.0, What kind of weekend did you have Anthony?
531.0,532.0, You're larping.
532.0,533.0, No.
534.0,536.0, Larping might have been a step up.
536.0,539.0, From the gathering.
539.0,541.0, I went to in San Jose.
541.0,542.0, Uh oh.
542.0,543.0, You so word gathering.
543.0,545.0, Is that the capital G?
545.0,546.0, Yeah.
546.0,548.0, My friends all play hardcore magic.
548.0,553.0," Like when I went to college, like my last couple of years in Davis, our house was known as the magic house."
553.0,554.0, Like with all the college kids.
554.0,556.0," Because they, they'd all come over to battle."
556.0,558.0, That's not the house you want to be.
558.0,560.0, But I never played.
560.0,561.0, Yeah.
561.0,562.0, I just wanted to be a house.
562.0,565.0, I guess in some way I maintained like a whole year then now by playing Warhammer.
565.0,566.0, As we did.
566.0,567.0, Yeah.
567.0,568.0, You should jump in a church.
568.0,572.0," Just like I remember when all the people I know that we played Warhammer, we went to go buy a D&D book."
572.0,575.0," They were like, have we really sunk this far?"
575.0,577.0," I was like, the Warhammer."
577.0,580.0, So guns versus swords.
580.0,585.0, But yet we all got together in the South Bay and spent the night at my friend's house.
585.0,586.0," And like they were like, just coming out."
586.0,587.0, It would be really fun.
587.0,588.0," Well, get together."
588.0,593.0, They didn't tell me that like the night before the tournament was going to be spent.
593.0,597.0, Like just fucking talking gibberish about card stats the whole time.
597.0,599.0, I bring your box of cards down there.
599.0,601.0," I don't, I don't have cards."
601.0,602.0, I don't think I know.
602.0,603.0, I don't have a card.
603.0,604.0, I've never played magic.
604.0,608.0, But they all brought their cards and binders full of cards to trade.
608.0,609.0, And then.
609.0,614.0, And then I didn't know we also had a seven a.m. wakeup call because we had to get there by like
614.0,615.0, Team 9.
615.0,616.0, Team 9.
616.0,617.0," Oh, that's a hard day."
617.0,619.0, And Santa's a magic together in there.
619.0,624.0," And so like, how did you feel seven in the morning when you knew you were getting up that"
624.0,626.0, you were away for that on a weekend for magic?
626.0,628.0, I was really upset.
628.0,630.0," What they were like, get up for work."
630.0,631.0, 9.
631.0,635.0," So they were like, so they were like, uh, the worst."
635.0,640.0," You know, if we do really bad, which they figured they were, it was only going to take like two hours"
640.0,641.0, and then we could hang out.
641.0,642.0," I was like, okay, I'll go."
642.0,644.0, And so I drove out there with them.
645.0,650.0," As soon as we show up, like, you know, I immediately see like all the neck beard kids and like 90"
650.0,652.0, pounds or less kids.
652.0,653.0, And it's in the same way.
653.0,654.0, What it does.
654.0,656.0, It's in the same convention center actually.
656.0,660.0, That day is a religious revival and a cheerleader tournament.
660.0,661.0," Oh, that's fantastic."
661.0,662.0, That seems to happen.
662.0,663.0, We need photos.
663.0,664.0, That was a nice and blizzed.
664.0,668.0," Yeah, it was right next to the couples for Christ convention."
668.0,669.0, That's right.
669.0,670.0, Couples for Christ.
670.0,673.0," And we're so, so sorry that there wasn't a big giant Diablo head in the front of it."
673.0,674.0, Blizzcon.
674.0,675.0, Just for them.
675.0,681.0," But uh, see, you show up at nine and everyone has to like register their decks and then everyone"
681.0,682.0, walks around talking.
682.0,683.0, Register your deck.
683.0,685.0," Yeah, like some like with the judge with the judge."
685.0,688.0, So they know exactly like you have these cards.
688.0,689.0, So you don't try and pull that.
689.0,690.0, Wow.
690.0,691.0, A card in the middle.
691.0,694.0, So it's like airports of security like they stop you and they take your deck.
694.0,695.0, There.
695.0,698.0," There are the judges with like the special striped shirts that like,"
698.0,700.0, and they can laugh to become a judge.
700.0,702.0, You have to apprentice from another judge just to become a judge.
702.0,706.0," Like, and so this is a manual robe and stuff."
706.0,709.0, Now these guys actually kind of they're probably the shop owners.
709.0,711.0, What do they look like?
711.0,713.0," Like, like, everything you're imagining."
713.0,714.0, Yeah.
714.0,715.0, I've got to imagine.
715.0,716.0, But this is like a big moment for them.
716.0,717.0, This is like the big authority.
717.0,721.0," You know, they're talking to their wife tonight before about all the pressure they're"
721.0,722.0," under, you know, judging the next day."
722.0,724.0, They're studying the rule book.
724.0,726.0," You know, everything we got to learn is important."
726.0,731.0, So the only people that are there that aren't to play are like moms that brought their
731.0,732.0, kids.
732.0,735.0, So I'm sitting on the couch with like this chick that I described as Sean is like the
735.0,737.0, sponsor for Aquinet.
737.0,742.0," Like, she's got like the most crazy feathered hair and she drove up from LA because she's"
742.0,743.0, helping one of her kids.
743.0,746.0, Really how strike it rich with magic doesn't draw an open place.
746.0,747.0, Is that what she thought?
747.0,748.0," Yeah, they were all there."
748.0,749.0, Like they drove us out.
749.0,752.0," Well, I said, no, how much is it in the line here?"
752.0,754.0," Well, this tournament was a pro tournament qualifier."
754.0,758.0," So if they won, they would get to go into the pro tournament and pro tournaments pay like"
758.0,761.0," $10,000 or something like that."
761.0,765.0," Like, they're definitely like the top magic players in the world make like triple figures"
765.0,766.0, and stuff.
766.0,769.0, This is like though when you're in high school and you have like some older brothers telling
769.0,771.0, you how garbage man make 40 bucks an hour.
771.0,772.0," Yeah, yeah."
772.0,777.0," I mean, I mean, it's either that or what are they going to do to join the military or something"
777.0,779.0, join military play magic.
779.0,780.0, Fake battles real battles.
780.0,782.0," But yeah, I don't know."
782.0,783.0, It's crazy.
783.0,789.0," As soon as the tournament starts like within seconds, you hear like you just because it's"
789.0,793.0, four separate rooms and all the judges are in like a center room and then you just hear
793.0,794.0, Good.
794.0,798.0, Like all because that's how you get someone to check on the rules for you.
798.0,800.0, Anytime there's a card dispute or anything like that.
800.0,802.0, So then the stripe guy goes run and over.
802.0,806.0, Check and make a declaration of these disputes must be.
806.0,807.0, You cannot.
807.0,808.0, Yeah.
808.0,810.0, I'll raise your frozen wood dimped out on the table.
810.0,812.0, That's exactly what it's like.
812.0,817.0, So what happens when someone someone is kicked from play is ejected from the game.
817.0,819.0, How did they respond?
819.0,825.0," Uh, most people take it pretty like my one of my friends was was disqualified after the fourth"
825.0,826.0, round.
826.0,827.0, Why?
827.0,831.0, Because he had a piece of paper with the names of cards and what they did written on it.
831.0,835.0, Because he didn't want to ask the people he is wrong and they said that that was against
835.0,836.0, the rules.
836.0,838.0," Wow, like a cheat sheet of what cards do."
838.0,839.0, Yeah.
839.0,841.0, That's the same cheating.
841.0,842.0, Disqualified.
842.0,843.0, That's right.
843.0,845.0, Because don't people talk about a while they're playing?
845.0,846.0," Yeah, that's okay."
846.0,848.0, I guess it's just having like written information.
848.0,849.0, What the fuck?
849.0,851.0," I mean, that's just okay."
851.0,854.0, So and the rules have been passed out.
854.0,855.0, I protest that.
855.0,856.0, Yeah.
856.0,857.0, Yeah.
857.0,860.0, And it was gross to like just because I don't know.
860.0,863.0, You have to imagine everyone there's like drinking energy drinks and
863.0,864.0, Cheetos.
864.0,866.0, They're probably didn't smell too good in there.
866.0,867.0, No.
867.0,870.0," And then they're like, oh, oh, shit."
870.0,871.0, There's a subset to this story after.
871.0,873.0, Halfway through the day.
873.0,875.0, We get ridiculous.
875.0,877.0, What what's you talking about?
877.0,879.0, But would you know about that bathroom?
879.0,880.0, Because.
880.0,881.0, Yeah.
881.0,882.0, To sit on.
882.0,883.0," Oh, yeah."
883.0,884.0, Yeah.
884.0,885.0, Because yeah.
885.0,887.0," Because at some point I had to like, you know, go in there."
887.0,889.0, Because I was there for like seven hours.
889.0,891.0," Uh, and it just."
891.0,893.0, You had to run in there as soon as you got there.
893.0,894.0," Oh, yeah."
894.0,895.0, That's true.
896.0,898.0," You know, you can't tell me any of this shit and it."
898.0,901.0, Expect me to not bring it up on the podcast.
901.0,904.0, I had a little bit of a real balsen gym going on.
904.0,907.0," Just said, yeah, I got full of boiling magma on the right there."
907.0,909.0, It was causing you extreme pain.
909.0,910.0, Yeah.
910.0,915.0, So I had to run in there and beat all the kids that before they got in there.
915.0,917.0, Do it by Cheetos and Mountain Dew.
917.0,919.0, Spring it.
919.0,923.0," But by halfway through the day, it just looked like nothing but like three"
923.0,924.0, months ago.
924.0,925.0, The kids that didn't have a lot on to their.
925.0,929.0, The shit would just deliver everything but the toilet.
929.0,931.0, I don't know.
931.0,934.0, I like the doodles of your.
934.0,935.0, Yeah.
935.0,941.0, So what was the general age like there if the people playing these tournaments?
941.0,943.0, 14 to 40.
943.0,944.0, Okay.
944.0,946.0, But mostly was it boys?
946.0,948.0, Would you say it was it was it was all boys actually.
948.0,949.0, I don't remember seeing.
949.0,951.0," But I mean like as opposed to grown men like, you know,"
952.0,954.0," oh, no, there was a lot of grown men there."
954.0,955.0, Yeah.
955.0,956.0, Yeah.
956.0,959.0, I'd there's an alternate timeline where I'm there.
959.0,960.0, Totally.
960.0,961.0, Yeah.
961.0,962.0, Yeah.
962.0,964.0, There was a moment in college freshman year of college like first week.
964.0,967.0, Something one of the one of my floor mates.
967.0,970.0, I've latched on to because he had a Neo Geo.
970.0,975.0," He was like introducing his magic together in cards and I'm like, I've never seen this before."
975.0,980.0, But my brain was just like started percolating like you would be way too into this.
980.0,981.0, I've been doing it in all costs.
981.0,982.0, The math.
982.0,983.0, Yeah.
983.0,984.0, I've been in another universe.
984.0,986.0, I succumbed and graduated the gathering within that day.
986.0,987.0, Yeah.
987.0,990.0, I learned how to play while hearing a computer gaming world because when they first started
990.0,994.0," bringing out the first magic, the gathering online games."
994.0,999.0, So I got curious and Robert coffee and I learned how to play.
999.0,1000.0, And I totally saw it.
1000.0,1001.0, I thought it was cool.
1001.0,1003.0, I was I was completely into it.
1003.0,1008.0, But I was way past the point where I would let myself indulge in an obsession.
1008.0,1009.0," Well, in my life."
1009.0,1012.0, Wizards of the coast does make a world of work for us as well.
1012.0,1013.0, I do know this.
1013.0,1014.0, Yeah.
1014.0,1015.0, I've lost your own.
1015.0,1017.0, It was huge in college.
1017.0,1021.0, I remember that like actually guy became one of my best friends.
1021.0,1022.0, My undergrad years.
1022.0,1024.0, He was all into it.
1024.0,1028.0, And I was surprised because at first we'd always climb around like we used we'd go to his room.
1028.0,1034.0, And we'd take like the building was arranged so that each side of it face the other.
1034.0,1038.0, So we'd just take mirrors and play like whack them all with the other people in their rooms.
1038.0,1041.0," You know, shine reflect the user mirror reflect the sun into their window."
1041.0,1045.0, And then they try to look you hit him in the eyes so they don't pop back down because they could look you.
1045.0,1048.0, And then they try to sneak back up and get a look to see where it was coming from.
1048.0,1051.0, But then you got like hurry up and get up before they can see you.
1051.0,1053.0, And then we also he had like a.
1053.0,1058.0, He was in a musician so he had some guitar and a papyrus and we had this voice modulator that made you sound like an alien.
1058.0,1065.0, So we would like put the speaker up into the window and it would bounce the acoustics would bounce across the other side of the wall.
1065.0,1067.0," And we'd be like, I am an alien."
1067.0,1070.0, The thing I like best about earth is it's color.
1070.0,1073.0, It's just like talk talk out there all night.
1073.0,1075.0, But so he was all into it.
1075.0,1077.0, He never got me into it.
1077.0,1079.0, They would always be in like the little lounge playing.
1079.0,1084.0, But the thing I took away from it is I was quiz on like what's the most valuable cards and stuff.
1084.0,1087.0," And way back when he was always saying like, oh, dude, you got to get the black lotus."
1087.0,1088.0, You got to get the black lotus.
1088.0,1092.0, So I was able to use that knowledge like when I was in the line for.
1092.0,1094.0," Oh, here's another confession."
1094.0,1096.0, I wasn't ready to give.
1096.0,1101.0, I was reliant to see the ghost in the shell movie when that came out.
1101.0,1103.0, Again with another group of people like that.
1103.0,1106.0, And so the line was just smelly as all hell.
1106.0,1110.0," But so I started talking out loud about how yeah, you know, my little brother."
1110.0,1115.0, He just went to college and he gave me this huge stack of those magic cards that people are always talking about.
1115.0,1117.0, And he says some of them might be worth money.
1117.0,1119.0, So there's like a bunch of black lotus is not good stuff.
1119.0,1121.0, I just want to get them out of my house.
1121.0,1126.0," Immediately everyone in the line, not everyone literally but quite a few people, you know, like three or more."
1126.0,1131.0," Oh, I could not help here and you talk that you have some magic cards."
1131.0,1137.0, So you're one friend got the squalphide.
1137.0,1140.0, The other one's lost far too early on.
1140.0,1141.0, Yeah.
1141.0,1143.0, So this is like a failed Vegas trip or something.
1143.0,1150.0," Yeah, but the one friend that kept on going for like four rounds, each round is like an hour and 15 minutes or something like that."
1150.0,1156.0, So I ended up being there for like five hours before I finally just gave up that we weren't going to hang out and left.
1156.0,1157.0, Did you drive?
1157.0,1158.0," Yeah, I drove."
1158.0,1159.0, Why don't you leave him there?
1159.0,1161.0," Oh, well, they had a car too."
1161.0,1162.0, I drove myself.
1162.0,1163.0, Why don't you just leave?
1163.0,1165.0, Because I was hopeful that you were up.
1165.0,1166.0, I don't want to see these people.
1166.0,1168.0," Yeah, most of them still live in Davis."
1168.0,1173.0, So can you go sit there next to them on their point or is it like roped off to like just it wouldn't matter.
1173.0,1177.0," No one, it's like the it'd be like watching chess or something like no one talks."
1177.0,1179.0, Everyone sits in very silent.
1179.0,1182.0," Oh, yeah, you can't stand next to him and got dude."
1182.0,1187.0," You know, that's the fact that the whole time I wanted to walk behind and don't play that."
1187.0,1190.0," I wanted to walk behind and be like, he has three cobblants and walk away."
1190.0,1192.0, What are they going to do?
1192.0,1193.0, Kick me out like I'm big.
1193.0,1195.0, I'm trying to kick me out.
1195.0,1198.0," Although I did see one person get taken away in handcuffs, but I don't know why."
1198.0,1199.0, Really?
1199.0,1200.0," Yeah, that's awesome."
1200.0,1201.0, A big barely dude.
1201.0,1204.0, The cops like four cops just came in and handcuffed him and he's very calmly.
1204.0,1208.0, That's what I was asking about the age because I just I would just love to see like some.
1208.0,1213.0," Some grown man, you know, it's 40 some dude like me like getting in like an argument with some like 13 year old boy."
1213.0,1218.0," He told the judge, he's like, if I was the ex-men's gambit or this card in your face."
1218.0,1222.0, And they're like that's it for you.
1222.0,1225.0, My big problem was with all these things.
1225.0,1226.0, It's just the same damn thing.
1226.0,1230.0, It's the money sink of this that just it just fundamentally.
1230.0,1233.0, Probably to me from it's a brilliant business game.
1233.0,1236.0, It really is like a great car how much.
1236.0,1247.0," Yeah, yeah, like it doesn't take long for you to get to a point where you buy a pack and you open it up and you have every single damn card and you're just like, wow, that was just I just might as well throw in two dollars and 50 cents out the window."
1247.0,1255.0," Yeah, but don't they make it so that you can't win with the two to buy them right you have to upgrade along with everybody else."
1255.0,1260.0," Well, and out on their website, they sell individual cards at like market value prices as well."
1260.0,1264.0," Wow, for people that are like, I really just want this one card you can buy it."
1264.0,1271.0," Wow, have you have you guys ever spent a week grinding for some some drop in World of Warcraft and didn't get it."
1271.0,1277.0," No, um, I mean, there's times that we've gone on a raid and then the item didn't drop after I spend a lot of hours."
1277.0,1280.0," I mean, yeah, we can submit a point of trying to make it."
1280.0,1281.0," Yeah, I mean, yeah, for sure."
1281.0,1285.0," I mean, times where you just are doing something that never does."
1285.0,1286.0, But there's something different.
1286.0,1287.0, Ever.
1287.0,1290.0," Yeah, well, they're really, they're paying up monthly fee."
1291.0,1299.0," But the month you're paying the money anyway, right? You're not paying to, you know, but if you did, if I'm just like if you're like a cable TV thing,"
1299.0,1300.0, you spent that week grinding.
1300.0,1303.0," Yeah, and you really didn't want to do it. You just wanted the item."
1303.0,1305.0, You just wanted the loot.
1305.0,1307.0, You didn't get the loot.
1307.0,1309.0, Better be some good Lord to make up.
1309.0,1312.0," Well, there's other aspects."
1312.0,1315.0," Yeah, World of Warcraft and particular doesn't really."
1315.0,1318.0," Yeah, it's taken out where you're grinding for that law."
1318.0,1320.0, I definitely had that same only.
1320.0,1321.0, You do.
1321.0,1323.0, The duration of your subscription fee.
1323.0,1325.0, Like one really bad one.
1325.0,1326.0, What did you do?
1326.0,1331.0," Oh, it was just like, there was this one item I wanted for my, my ogreshaman."
1331.0,1332.0, Was it your epic?
1332.0,1336.0," No, I used only like level 30, but it was like the best thing I could get for a level 30."
1336.0,1339.0, And I knew it dropped in this one place.
1339.0,1340.0, And it never quest.
1340.0,1342.0, It was all just like random spawns and something drops.
1342.0,1346.0, It isn't like in World of Warcraft or at least it wasn't when I played.
1346.0,1351.0," And so my roommate got on and he dual boxed, which is where he was playing two accounts at once."
1351.0,1353.0, And I was playing one account.
1353.0,1356.0, And our computer said about four feet across each other.
1356.0,1360.0," And then like, I don't even think we had any food so we'd just date rice or something."
1360.0,1362.0," We're like, and like we committed that morning."
1362.0,1364.0," Like we're staying here until it drops, right?"
1364.0,1365.0," And he's like, yes."
1365.0,1370.0, And then like literally I'm not joking 15 hours later as when it dropped.
1370.0,1372.0, So we set their doing the same area.
1372.0,1376.0, Killing the same 10 things and then waiting half hour for them to reappear.
1376.0,1377.0," Wow, killing them again."
1377.0,1387.0," See, Warcraft has this mechanic with the Draeds where there's there's going to be certain items you really want like a weapon, but they're always in the raids and the raids have like a week or a three day reset time."
1387.0,1391.0," So you can you can't grind it for that long, but you have to wait a whole week."
1391.0,1394.0, It was basically in a month in your $15 worth of time.
1394.0,1397.0, You can give it you have four chances at it.
1397.0,1399.0, So that's that's I'm in more sense.
1399.0,1402.0, Like that's like getting the your desk and card or whatever the little one.
1402.0,1404.0, But that's what makes it so much so precious.
1404.0,1408.0, That's that's we've been in we've been in fantasy discussion for a while.
1408.0,1409.0," Yeah, I want to have it along."
1409.0,1411.0, Don't make us leave Sean.
1411.0,1413.0, We can come back to it.
1413.0,1414.0," We'll be like, look at the clock."
1414.0,1417.0," It's like, that's 40 foot four minutes of yield."
1417.0,1418.0, Only 25.
1418.0,1420.0, We like it here.
1420.0,1425.0," So we're going to talk about, you know, just games we're looking forward to that that are coming out."
1425.0,1434.0," No, we've had looks at stuff later on, but before we hit that either you guys got got some currently playing stuff that that isn't."
1434.0,1437.0, Isn't that this is a real fantasy.
1437.0,1439.0, I'm still on my civil or obsession.
1439.0,1441.0, So there you go.
1441.0,1445.0," Yeah, I mean, I installed civil after your your thing."
1445.0,1450.0," Do your blog post in your rat lunch week, but it's just sitting there installed and I have not clicked to start it."
1451.0,1462.0, It's that's just I got to say I continue to just blow me away. It just have crazy deep it is. I was playing it last night for a long time and I got utterly obsessed with with
1462.0,1471.0," Making sure every single tile on my map was was maximize to its its full usage, which is not even I mean, that's."
1471.0,1479.0," It's not a sub game, but you know, you can get if you want to get bogged down in the minutia of managing every city you have you can."
1479.0,1485.0," I had avoided doing that because I haven't done that since, you know, post college."
1485.0,1492.0, And now I've been playing for so many hours that just the idea of just conquering the world is now no longer enough.
1492.0,1496.0, Now I need to conquer the world with maximum efficiency.
1496.0,1500.0, So it's taking up even more even more hours now.
1500.0,1502.0, Start blogging about your progress.
1502.0,1506.0, It's terrible. I've just got I've just got it running because it doesn't take up that much RAM.
1506.0,1511.0, I've just been sitting there in the background all the time the same game. I'm just all tabbing.
1511.0,1529.0," You know, I'd like be in the office with my wife and you know, supposed to be working on, you know, quick and or whatever around the house, but you know, it's like, you know, having your boss or teacher around as soon as she's either the room I'm all tabbing and getting a few turns and back to the staff that is pinball."
1529.0,1540.0," Yeah, I just was great game. I was continuing my console kicks when I went to dwell on that on GFW radio, but finished Mario finally and I went back to Drake's fortune, which I had abandoned for a while."
1540.0,1543.0, I was going to buy Pat upon this weekend. I did buy Pat upon.
1543.0,1546.0," And I'm kind of, film how I was."
1546.0,1547.0," Yeah, I feel like how you were."
1547.0,1557.0," It's kind of actually once you get a little later into it, you get a couple levels where you can kind of see some quote strategy emerging just because you start reading what a boss might be doing."
1557.0,1561.0," And like, okay, it's wearing its heads. It's where I have to hit the defend thing."
1561.0,1566.0," But it is really if you reduce it down to its basic core, you have three buttons and that's it."
1566.0,1568.0, You just have to load the song.
1568.0,1570.0," It's just, yeah, it's a little bit smaller."
1570.0,1573.0," Yeah, I watched the trailer and it made me want to play it."
1573.0,1577.0," When you first play it, you said you're like, this is, I mean, this is one of the special gaming moments."
1577.0,1578.0," Oh, special moments."
1578.0,1582.0," Yeah, and yeah, so you, you want to love it."
1582.0,1586.0," It, it just like, like, catamar convinces you that you, that this is something you want to love, but then you keep playing."
1586.0,1588.0, And it kind of fades away.
1588.0,1590.0, But isn't it just 20 bucks?
1590.0,1591.0," Yeah, this is 20 bucks."
1591.0,1597.0," Which is the one piece of level that almost made me throw it out was the, the desert crossing level."
1597.0,1598.0, Did you do that?
1598.0,1599.0, I don't know.
1599.0,1601.0," Yeah, you have to make it rain or something like that."
1601.0,1612.0," Yeah, that one suddenly all of a sudden you're rhythm matching skills have to be on a whole other plane because you have to get in the fever mode and like be in there constantly and then do this rain dance, which they teach you."
1612.0,1623.0," And if you don't, the earth starts on fire and all of your guys just burned a death and you're not and like if to keep repeating this and you have to keep getting the fever mode and then keep doing it and then if you screw up once, you might as well start over."
1623.0,1626.0," So that is the one that made me go, okay."
1626.0,1628.0, I don't know if I like this.
1628.0,1629.0, You.
1629.0,1633.0, The other piece of the game I started playing was a god of war.
1633.0,1636.0, But I got to dumb down the difficulty level.
1636.0,1641.0, I'm afraid because I can't beat the very first boss who's five minutes into the game.
1641.0,1642.0, Like literally.
1642.0,1649.0," It's happened to me with the first double make cry, but I have an excuse that nubbed to my PSP broke off."
1649.0,1650.0," Well, the nub is crap anyway."
1650.0,1652.0, It's a little plate thing.
1652.0,1653.0, Yeah.
1653.0,1657.0, So it's just like a steak and it hurts my thumb to press on that thing.
1657.0,1659.0, Can't you like a guy for it?
1659.0,1661.0," Yeah, I guess I could."
1661.0,1663.0, I was wondering if they sell replacement nubs.
1663.0,1664.0, They do.
1664.0,1665.0, Yeah.
1665.0,1668.0," I don't know if you can buy from the store, but now you can pick them up."
1668.0,1669.0, Really?
1669.0,1671.0, Quite the niche market there.
1671.0,1673.0, It's because it happens a lot.
1673.0,1674.0, Okay.
1674.0,1676.0," Maybe I can get in now, but it's like, you know, a Final Fantasy 7."
1676.0,1678.0," This walking the garden, it's office and pop on up on the one."
1678.0,1681.0," Shane, I could probably get a bulk discount from Shane."
1681.0,1683.0, So when you supplier.
1683.0,1688.0, It's a thing that we were both playing front lines.
1688.0,1690.0, I have been talking about.
1690.0,1691.0, I talked about a little bit last week.
1691.0,1692.0, Now my review.
1692.0,1695.0," I don't know if it's up yet, but I turned it in yesterday."
1695.0,1696.0, So it should be online.
1696.0,1697.0, It's not the conscious.
1698.0,1700.0," Yeah, just as on there."
1700.0,1703.0, We had high hopes for front lines.
1703.0,1704.0, We did.
1704.0,1705.0, And I still do.
1705.0,1709.0," So after all that, I've talked about some of the things that work well with it."
1709.0,1710.0, It's first let me get in.
1710.0,1712.0, I'm just going to get right into it now.
1712.0,1714.0, Like here's the change.
1714.0,1717.0, Is that the game wasn't ready for release.
1717.0,1718.0, It's buggy.
1718.0,1720.0, And I'm in for the course of the review.
1720.0,1721.0, I played it on this.
1721.0,1722.0, I played it on XP.
1722.0,1726.0, I played the box copy and also played steam copy.
1726.0,1728.0, And this was on each of my machines.
1728.0,1729.0, I did both.
1729.0,1730.0, And the steam one.
1730.0,1734.0, I really feel bad for people that purchase it over steam because it just does not work.
1734.0,1737.0, It crashes the moment you you open it over and over again.
1737.0,1743.0," Eventually without doing anything, I was able to get it to start running at work on steam."
1743.0,1745.0, And then now it's kind of sporadic.
1745.0,1747.0, But sometimes it's an autocrash sometimes it doesn't.
1747.0,1748.0, There was a patch.
1748.0,1749.0, So I installed that.
1749.0,1750.0, There was a vista.
1750.0,1752.0, The vista version was doing the same thing.
1752.0,1753.0, The box copy.
1753.0,1754.0," I mean, that the vista version."
1754.0,1755.0, But it's the same game.
1755.0,1756.0, But I was playing on a vista machine.
1756.0,1758.0, It was doing the same thing.
1758.0,1760.0, I installed a hot fix.
1760.0,1763.0, And I don't know what that did because now on that version.
1763.0,1765.0, I can know of the online maps.
1765.0,1767.0, There are only two that I'm able to join.
1767.0,1769.0, Every other every other map I tried to join.
1769.0,1770.0, And this was weird.
1770.0,1771.0, It was frustrating.
1771.0,1773.0, And at first I thought it was everything.
1773.0,1774.0," And then I was like, wait."
1774.0,1775.0, This is not a coincidence.
1775.0,1777.0, It's just these two maps that I'm all out of.
1777.0,1779.0, Join without crashing the game.
1779.0,1781.0," So now if I'm on a server, whatever."
1781.0,1783.0," And I join when it's on like, say for example,"
1783.0,1788.0, there's one of the maps I have access to on that machine and on that version.
1788.0,1793.0," Uh, if we finished that round and the server changes map's blue middle crush to desktop,"
1793.0,1795.0, that was truly bizarre.
1795.0,1797.0," Um, on the XP version."
1797.0,1801.0," The server browser has this thing where sometimes just hitting a lunch won't do anything,"
1801.0,1803.0, it'll just make the noise and that said it won't work anymore.
1803.0,1806.0," And then if you hit back, then it just kind of crashes."
1806.0,1808.0, It just sticks there forever.
1808.0,1809.0," Sean, it's just all for multiplayer."
1809.0,1811.0, You're talking to those all for multiplayer.
1811.0,1812.0," Except for of course, when I'm talking to some people."
1812.0,1815.74, I'm talking about a crash to desktop when you try to open the game.
1815.74,1816.64, That's for single players.
1816.64,1818.34," Well, that just means you can't play the game."
1818.34,1819.64, That's for the steam version.
1819.64,1821.44, OK.
1821.44,1824.36, Then they had the issue to patch and then they
1824.36,1826.52, within 24 hours of it being out.
1826.52,1826.84, Right.
1826.84,1831.84, But then it was like another couple days before they issued the same patch for steam users.
1831.84,1835.8," But that didn't fix the issue because I got, you know, afterward."
1835.8,1838.68, The set thing is it's labeled a game for Windows game.
1838.68,1839.88, It's right on the box.
1839.88,1841.32, That's a symbol of quality.
1841.32,1843.32, This doesn't like it.
1843.32,1845.6799999999998, So this doesn't like the game.
1845.6799999999998,1847.6799999999998, Other little bullshit technical things.
1847.6799999999998,1852.9199999999998, The crazy thing is chaos studios who developed this are former battlefield 1942
1852.9199999999998,1853.9199999999998, monitors.
1853.9199999999998,1855.36, They have to have played battlefield two.
1855.36,1857.8799999999999, They were actually part of dice before dice sold them for a while.
1857.8799999999999,1859.76, I don't know what happened there.
1859.76,1863.2," So to my knowledge, I mean, really, you know, enterprise and guys."
1863.2,1865.9199999999998," And it's like, I want to see them succeed."
1865.9199999999998,1870.56," But at the same time, you're like, did you not learn any lessons and all that experience with"
1870.56,1871.56, battlefield?
1871.56,1876.2," Because it's notoriously shitty browsers, which they ended up fixing by the time 2042 came"
1876.2,1877.2, out.
1877.2,1878.2, They fixed a lot of issues.
1878.2,1880.1599999999999," But so, you know, there's no friends list."
1880.1599999999999,1885.3999999999999," There's no, when the server list, when you hit refresh, just continues to update itself."
1885.3999999999999,1886.56, But there's no stop refresh.
1886.56,1889.76," So what happens is it continues to jump around and say you see a game, you're like, oh,"
1889.76,1892.24," look, 20 ping, 20 players out of 30."
1892.24,1893.48, That sounds perfect.
1893.48,1894.48, You click it.
1894.48,1896.56, So you can't double click it and join it.
1896.56,1900.08, You have to highlight it and then move your arrow down to the bottom and hit launch.
1900.08,1902.56, That between no matter how fast you are now.
1902.56,1905.24," And I'm like, I've got a pretty quick house in."
1905.24,1906.24, You highlight the thing.
1906.24,1910.28," And by the time you get your arrow down to the launch button, it's already jumped to something"
1910.28,1911.28, out.
1911.28,1912.72, You can't stop the refresh.
1912.72,1913.72, No.
1913.72,1917.12," And then so when it's jumped to something else, then you could really be fucked because"
1917.12,1921.6, it's like 60% of the servers underpeng list like X's.
1921.6,1922.8, And I still don't know what that means.
1922.8,1925.8799999999999, But it's guaranteed to crash or it's guaranteed to just kick you back.
1925.8799999999999,1929.1999999999998, So then you got to wait for it to attempt to load that and then kick you back.
1929.2,1931.0800000000002," And it takes, you can just wait."
1931.0800000000002,1933.1200000000001, You have to wait out the refresh.
1933.1200000000001,1935.76, And it will still always do a little movement.
1935.76,1937.48, But it will stop the major jumping around.
1937.48,1939.44," But it might take like a full five minutes, right?"
1939.44,1940.64," I mean, you're sitting there."
1940.64,1941.64, It takes a while.
1941.64,1944.96, You can't even if you can't put on filters to limit the amount coming back.
1944.96,1949.1200000000001, Or do there are some filters and I have a mom like don't show me empty servers.
1949.1200000000001,1951.48," Don't, you know, and even with those, there's still quite a few servers out."
1951.48,1954.8400000000001," You know, more than enough to fill the screen."
1954.8400000000001,1957.0800000000002," So that, that kind of shifts crazy."
1957.08,1961.12," And then when you're in the game, when you hit tab, you can't see your ping."
1961.12,1965.56, This is the thing where PC players that get this are our suspicious because they know it
1965.56,1967.4399999999998, was a multi platform release.
1967.4399999999998,1971.1599999999999," And they're like, oh, see you guys made a console game."
1971.1599999999999,1972.4399999999998, And they did and they didn't.
1972.4399999999998,1973.9199999999998," Those ways they clearly did, right?"
1973.9199999999998,1974.9199999999998, You can't see your ping.
1974.9199999999998,1976.1599999999999, You can't see the server IP.
1976.1599999999999,1977.8," So when you're in the game, there's no friends list."
1977.8,1980.12, And you're trying to tell your friends who you're talking to and event.
1980.12,1983.1999999999998," And then trying to tell Anthony, getting this game, what is it?"
1983.1999999999998,1984.52, I don't know.
1984.52,1985.6799999999998, I can't find out.
1985.6799999999998,1987.04, It doesn't show anymore.
1987.48,1989.68, It doesn't show up on the screen while you're in the game.
1989.68,1993.52," No, that information's not no longer available once you're in the game."
1993.52,1997.48," So that kind of shit is, you know, I talk about how I hate to review."
1997.48,2000.92, I wonder if you games as entertainment software and stuff.
2000.92,2003.1599999999999, And I don't want to do the whole consumer important.
2003.1599999999999,2007.04, But it was unavoidable in this case because if you bought this game and you had no
2007.04,2012.92," for warning of these issues that you most definitely will be facing, I would be furious."
2012.92,2014.8," I would be like, get me my fucking money back."
2014.8,2016.8, I don't want shit to do with this anymore.
2016.8,2021.56," And people in the message boards for their, for their message boards were pretty vocal about"
2021.56,2023.84," Yeah, and that's saying well, how they got fucked."
2023.84,2024.84," Yeah, we've got it."
2024.84,2025.84," Oh, yeah."
2025.84,2029.56," Everything that I've mentioned and more there, if you go to the PC Help form, it's just loaded."
2029.56,2031.12, And it's so universal now.
2031.12,2034.72," And the console, it's another story, but it's got a lot of issues as well."
2034.72,2036.36, But you like the Wikipedia page.
2036.36,2038.0, It's like the very first part of the entry.
2038.0,2041.12," It's talking about how what a, a business will train wreck."
2041.12,2043.24, This launch has been for it.
2043.24,2045.44," And it's got to be, I mean, I don't know."
2045.44,2047.3600000000001," I mean, it will clearly came out too soon."
2047.3600000000001,2048.36, It was baited.
2048.36,2051.8, There was a PC public beta test through file planets.
2051.8,2053.04, So that's bizarre.
2053.04,2057.0," And the reason none of this would matter if the game was shit, it's up the game can be a whole"
2057.0,2058.28, lot of fun.
2058.28,2063.44," What I figured figured out is that for me, the big maps, which is oil field and the"
2063.44,2068.76," other one called solar farm, they're basically battlefield style maps, there's planes,"
2068.76,2072.4, there's helicopters and tons of real estate.
2072.4,2074.76," There, they're not so much fun."
2074.8,2077.1200000000003, You get into all the old problems that you haven't battlefielded.
2077.1200000000003,2078.6000000000004, Except these guys haven't corrected them.
2078.6000000000004,2081.88, The one that they tried to address is the sea sign capture points.
2081.88,2085.0, And that's where you have all these capture points across the map.
2085.0,2088.0800000000004," And your team is just like, let's just spread out and cap these."
2088.0800000000004,2089.0800000000004, And it's just nonsense.
2089.0800000000004,2092.32, Now they have a front line where there might be three in that front line.
2092.32,2095.28," But once that's held, you have to just focus on those."
2095.28,2097.7200000000003," But outside of that, I mean, down to the smallest things."
2097.7200000000003,2102.1600000000003," Like, what about the two launch, grenade launchers were, it's insanely abused."
2102.1600000000003,2103.5600000000004, Everyone was just using them.
2103.6,2107.12," And the classic new tube happens in a lot of like, so-called tactical shooters."
2107.12,2110.04," And in this game, it's a non-stop grenade launcher kills."
2110.04,2111.52, And it's annoying as hell.
2111.52,2112.52, That's there.
2112.52,2116.2799999999997," Old battlefield things like, what do you do when you're, say, you're in a helicopter"
2116.2799999999997,2120.16, in your passenger and the pilot crashes or something?
2120.16,2124.08, And it attributes to kill to the pilot or sometimes to the passengers.
2124.08,2125.7599999999998," It's like, we've been flying and we get blown up."
2125.7599999999998,2128.88," And it's like, it'll say, Rory or whoever was the gunner killed me."
2128.88,2130.7999999999997, And then he loses points for that.
2130.88,2131.96, Bizarro stuff.
2133.0800000000004,2137.36, Other technical things I didn't want to mention this because this is really weird.
2137.36,2140.2400000000002," Unreal Engine 3 so far, every multiplayer game I played on that."
2140.2400000000002,2143.2400000000002, It tends to load the textures in as you're playing.
2143.2400000000002,2146.8," On the upside, it means unlike Balfa 2, you're not spending a 10 minutes"
2146.8,2147.96, waiting to get in the game.
2147.96,2148.96, You load very quickly.
2148.96,2154.88," But when you get in the game, if your PC is not just flat out top of the line,"
2154.88,2159.6000000000004, it chugs after you've been spawned into the world and all the textures are blank.
2159.6,2161.8399999999997, And then it's like loading them onto the thing.
2161.8399999999997,2166.3199999999997," So what this means and this is for me, I don't know if it's just a VISTA issue or"
2166.3199999999997,2170.96," what, but I have an 8800 video card, it's a really good machine."
2170.96,2171.96, It's pretty much the same.
2171.96,2172.7999999999997, The art.
2172.7999999999997,2176.48, But I get this big lag and then everyone else that's in the game world can see you stuck
2176.48,2177.7599999999998," there and they know, oh, great."
2177.7599999999998,2178.7599999999998," Gosh, you're that fool."
2178.7599999999998,2181.8399999999997," It's like, stuck in a scare, a scare-cross position."
2181.8399999999997,2184.08," And then furthermore, when you get in a vehicle, like,"
2184.08,2187.8399999999997, since it doesn't automatically have like the textures for the vehicle cockpit and
2187.84,2189.52," stuff loaded, it'll do it again."
2189.52,2191.8," And you get out of the vehicle, it'll do it again."
2191.8,2194.48," If you switch to a drone, it'll do it yet again."
2194.48,2199.28," So it's like, in a multiplayer game like this, I'm willing to really people are willing"
2199.28,2204.0, to sacrifice any sort of visual fidelity and detail for performance.
2204.0,2205.28, Because that's really what it comes down to.
2205.28,2208.96, Like the difference between when I play here on the XP machine is insane.
2208.96,2210.88, I feel completely empowered.
2210.88,2214.6800000000003," All the kills that I all, all the battles that I feel I should win, I win."
2214.6800000000003,2216.8, And then you go home and all this frustrating stuff happens.
2216.8,2220.0," Like, it just lagged for performance reason."
2220.0,2221.44," You know, CPU lag or something."
2221.44,2224.04," And I didn't get my kill instead, I got killed."
2224.04,2225.32," So that kind of stuff, it's weird."
2225.32,2230.04," It's like, I don't know if there's some solution for that that's patchable or what,"
2230.04,2231.6000000000004, but that's kind of annoying.
2231.6000000000004,2234.2400000000002, But so did you turn down your graphical settings in the Vista?
2234.2400000000002,2237.7200000000003," Oh, God, on the Vista machine at home, so playing considering that I'm playing"
2237.7200000000003,2241.92," on an 8800, I'm only playing like 1028 and it like all set setting set to medium."
2241.92,2246.0," Of course, no anti-aliasing, no, which is bad because it's a jag yes, like"
2246.0,2251.44," UE3 engine is like really jagged if you're, if you're not running anti-aliasing, especially"
2251.44,2256.24," at that resolution, the thing game runs like very poorly on the Vista machine."
2256.24,2258.64, That's why I'm thinking it's Vista type issues going on.
2258.64,2260.84, It just doesn't make any sense.
2260.84,2262.84, But so despite how fast is your CPU?
2262.84,2264.64," I'll have to check, I forget."
2264.64,2265.64, But it's good.
2265.64,2269.32," It came out like just last year mid, you know, 2007."
2269.32,2272.92, It was brand new at that time.
2272.92,2277.2400000000002," And so the fact that I still willing to say, I like this game, despite all that, shows"
2277.2400000000002,2280.2400000000002," it like when they get stuff right, they're really getting it right."
2280.2400000000002,2284.4," And that's like, so instead of the big giant maps with all the issues and stuff, all"
2284.4,2288.84," the smaller maps, give the game this originality in this space that's unique."
2288.84,2293.08," Instead of just being a battlefield clone made by former battlefield modders, it feels"
2293.08,2297.48," like something in between like college D.D.4, which is much smaller, everything feels"
2297.48,2301.56," bigger and stuff, but it's because it's like, you know, just straight infantry."
2301.56,2304.32, And then the full battlefield experience with the vehicles.
2304.32,2307.92, And that's because all those bots and remote control drones they have end up serving the
2307.92,2312.2," same purpose that the vehicles do for tactical variety, just all the different kind of things"
2312.2,2313.2, you could do.
2313.2,2316.56," And just changing up the experience all the time, the trickery and stuff."
2316.56,2322.16," But without the issues of the other of the full vehicle, things I was talking about, fighting"
2322.16,2326.0," over who gets it, one seemingly overpowered, finding just, you know, really good ways"
2326.0,2327.0, to exploit it.
2327.0,2328.6, And also just making it feel unique.
2328.6,2333.08," So I think if they had focused just on that, maps like this one called street or mount"
2333.08,2336.7999999999997," top or village, and if they just took that scale and said, let's focus on this, that's"
2336.7999999999997,2341.24," focus on the bot use, let's make it so people can personalize them, upgrade them, give"
2341.24,2345.24," it the persistence that call D.D.4 has, that's, you know, gone over so well with their"
2345.24,2346.24, audience there.
2346.24,2350.8399999999997," Instead of trying to do everything, it's like their map size, they try to do COD4 style"
2350.8399999999997,2356.8399999999997," maps, they try to do maps that are just like remakes of from the desert combat mod, battlefield,"
2356.92,2360.52," they try to cover all bases and it's just, you know, I think they should have focused"
2360.52,2362.7200000000003, on the bot thing.
2362.7200000000003,2364.6400000000003, What are the map sizes?
2364.6400000000003,2366.76, 64 players if you want.
2366.76,2368.96," Supposedly, but I've never seen a match."
2368.96,2369.96, Have you seen?
2369.96,2374.36," I have, I avoid them because I try to play the smaller maps and so it's like I don't want"
2374.36,2377.7200000000003," 64 players in playing street, you know."
2377.7200000000003,2378.7200000000003, And here's why it's cool.
2378.7200000000003,2382.1600000000003, I think it's best to just give you an example of gameplay.
2382.16,2387.7599999999998," So like if you're running around in this world and someone does combine in a light vehicle,"
2387.7599999999998,2393.04," they combine in an APC with a gun under or something, you go and hide behind a building and"
2393.04,2397.24," normally in a battlefield scenario, if you're not the right class, if you don't have a rocket,"
2397.24,2399.8399999999997," you're pretty much fucked or if you're not spec ops where you can throw something on,"
2399.8399999999997,2401.2799999999997," and then you know, see for on it."
2401.2799999999997,2404.92, So you kind of hide back there until splash damage eventually kills you or someone else
2404.92,2406.8399999999997, comes along and distracts them.
2406.8399999999997,2412.12," But here you're able to go back there, switch to a little RC buggy and then drive it back"
2412.12,2415.7999999999997, around the corner and then run it right underneath his vehicle and blow it up and it will
2415.7999999999997,2416.7999999999997, blow up his vehicle.
2416.7999999999997,2419.8399999999997," If you're the drone class though, that's the thing."
2419.8399999999997,2421.68," Oh, so you do have to be a certain class."
2421.68,2425.08," You have to be a certain class, but they're only, these are like, they're not even classes"
2425.08,2428.72," there for like main classes and then like sub, yes, the classes."
2428.72,2431.0, And it's the drone thing goes over so well.
2431.0,2432.4," I mean, that's another fault of the game."
2432.4,2436.0," It's like, that's all you ever want to do is that thing."
2436.0,2440.68, And it works fine because there's there's six drones total three for each team.
2440.68,2442.68, And do you go on to the point of view of the drone?
2442.68,2443.68," One, two."
2443.68,2444.68," Yes, you do."
2444.68,2445.68, And you can do first person or third.
2445.68,2452.56, And that's what's so cool is like say someone's like stalking you or something.
2452.56,2456.2799999999997," Or you're out driving around or flying around in the drone and you just notice, oh, they're"
2456.2799999999997,2460.64, going to someone and he's heading to where I'm actually standing and controlling this thing.
2460.64,2464.7599999999998, Do I switch back and get ready to fight him or do I chase him with the drone?
2464.7599999999998,2468.24, And then so maybe you chase him and you see he's just about to like come up and clock
2468.24,2469.8799999999997, you in the face and kill you with melee.
2469.88,2470.88, And you get up just in time.
2470.88,2473.48, So he falls at your feet even though you like remote.
2473.48,2474.48, He did it.
2474.48,2475.48, His cool experience.
2475.48,2478.08," You know, or like, or say someone's sniping, that's normally the bitch."
2478.08,2481.88," Like fuck, there's like, there's, I mean, you, you complain about how you got snipers."
2481.88,2484.88, Where's that shithead again that just goes and lays down for the whole game.
2484.88,2485.88, Uh-huh.
2485.88,2486.7200000000003, And just sits there shooting a dickhead.
2486.7200000000003,2490.88," So you, with this guy, I mean, with this game, you can get a drone and then you fly"
2490.88,2492.6800000000003, it around and you find the guy.
2492.6800000000003,2497.04, And then like you have the scenario where suddenly he was in this position where he could hurt
2497.04,2498.36, people with relative impunity.
2498.36,2499.36, Right?
2499.36,2501.6800000000003, And then you have a sniper rifle or grenades or something.
2501.6800000000003,2506.1200000000003," Now, you're the one who can hurt him with impunity because if he shoots down your drone,"
2506.1200000000003,2507.6800000000003," whatever, you're not going to die."
2507.6800000000003,2511.96," And you have these red games where he's, say, he's out on a balcony and he sees your drone"
2511.96,2515.92," coming and he runs inside the hallway so that, you know, when your drone's going to pass"
2515.92,2518.7200000000003," through the hallway, he'll be able to shoot it when it's kind of silhouette in the door."
2518.7200000000003,2523.1600000000003, But then you kind of go around and go in another window and come down the hallway behind him
2523.1600000000003,2526.1200000000003, and then blow him up from behind with the drone or something.
2526.1200000000003,2527.1200000000003," And that, that stuff's red."
2527.1200000000003,2528.1200000000003, They fly through the sky.
2528.1200000000003,2529.1200000000003, They all die quickly.
2529.12,2530.12, They're shooting a flying drone.
2530.12,2533.12, It'll blow up so it has a cool down or anything.
2533.12,2538.52," I mean, you have a level up or something like you have to do so much before you'll get"
2538.52,2540.0, the ability to use it.
2540.0,2543.52," And when you have it, doesn't stay alive until it gets shot down."
2543.52,2547.3599999999997, And it has a signal distance to prevent you from cruising the entire map.
2547.3599999999997,2548.3599999999997, Okay.
2548.3599999999997,2551.68," And then once it's blown up, it has a long recharge rate so you can't just boom throw it out"
2551.68,2552.68, again.
2552.68,2556.04," But you might have the other ones recharge so then you could say, if you just did a flyer"
2556.04,2560.44, drone and that worked then suddenly you could switch to a little tank type thing and cruise
2560.44,2561.44, around with that.
2561.44,2564.48," And so far I'm really happy with the balance because like I was saying the aircraft,"
2564.48,2566.72," you shoot them, two hits and they blow up."
2566.72,2569.88, And then the maps are made so that there's all this dust and debris floating around and
2569.88,2573.68, it's rad because you're always scanning for little movement in this game which is kind of
2573.68,2574.68, unusual.
2574.68,2575.68, So you're like freaking out.
2575.68,2577.68," Trash goes by and you're like, pop out and shoot that."
2577.68,2578.68, But that part's balanced.
2578.68,2582.8," The little tanks, they might rip you up and their heart is held to shoot."
2582.8,2585.2," But however, the turret traversals fairly slow."
2585.2,2589.16," So when you see one, you can run at it full speed and then you do do donuts around it"
2589.16,2592.72," and it's turret can't hit you and then since the physics works, I've actually knocked"
2592.72,2595.7599999999998, them over just by like bumping up against them and it's like a turtle or something
2595.7599999999998,2600.0, you've flipping on it side or you can just go around stabbing it or whatever.
2600.0,2604.48, And it's just so all the kind of like play that emerges from that is super fun.
2604.48,2610.64, And if it just performed well and consistently we could play the maps we want and this
2610.64,2611.64, is the other weird thing.
2611.64,2616.68, That map shit where I can't play certain maps on certain machines.
2616.68,2618.56, Rory in it and I don't I can't have it.
2618.56,2621.68, Rory has it but it's on the whole different set of maps.
2621.68,2624.44, So on the overlap there's only one map that we could both play.
2624.44,2627.7999999999997, So we ended up playing like nah from that machine the whole weekend.
2627.7999999999997,2631.68," Yeah, whereas mine runs fine on every map I've ever tried."
2631.68,2632.68, Right.
2632.68,2635.8799999999997, So it sounds like basically they put it out to early.
2635.8799999999997,2637.08, So they good game that way.
2637.08,2639.7599999999998, Which is fucked up because I was telling Sean it's like one of those things.
2639.76,2647.6000000000004, It's like people that may be there like getting back into PC gaming or this is like their first experience at PC gaming or like fuck this.
2647.6000000000004,2648.6000000000004, I buy these games.
2648.6000000000004,2650.1200000000003, They don't even work.
2650.1200000000003,2652.92," Like I hate when developers are just like, oh, we'll patch it later."
2652.92,2653.92," Yeah, it's that."
2653.92,2658.2400000000002, Precisely this scenario that you're describing is precisely the scenario that the Microsoft
2658.2400000000002,2660.0, launched the games for Windows and they should do it.
2660.0,2661.0, To get rid of it.
2661.0,2662.0," Yeah, right."
2662.0,2664.2000000000003, And here it is on official games for Windows game.
2664.2000000000003,2665.2000000000003, Yes.
2665.2000000000003,2666.92, Very frustrating.
2666.92,2668.5600000000004, It's like.
2668.56,2669.56, And I don't know.
2669.56,2671.52," Hey, like I'm not pointing the finger at anyone."
2671.52,2674.36, I could have been the developer could have been the publisher.
2674.36,2675.7999999999997, And my that could have been like whatever.
2675.7999999999997,2681.4," Just the corporation was like, hey, our stock plan just count depends on us having a product"
2681.4,2682.4, out in this quarter.
2682.4,2683.4, Right.
2683.4,2684.4," I mean, the freehouse of it."
2684.4,2685.4, I don't want to blame anyone.
2685.4,2688.7999999999997," But it's like in the end, it just completely fucks you over to do that."
2688.7999999999997,2690.96, Because now the word is spreading.
2690.96,2692.32, You look around and you bring it up.
2692.32,2694.68, The forum responses are all negative.
2694.68,2696.2, And it's like people getting bogged down on that.
2696.2,2697.2, But there's like a great game.
2697.2,2700.2799999999997, And this is a good game underneath there.
2700.2799999999997,2703.8799999999997," But this can be totally deadly to a game like this, right?"
2703.8799999999997,2707.3199999999997," I mean, once you get this reputation, it's really hard to come back."
2707.3199999999997,2708.3199999999997, Yeah.
2708.3199999999997,2711.72," I mean, even if like we've all heard those stories about a game having to go out"
2711.72,2715.3199999999997," for stock reasons or whatever, but it ends up so shooting themselves on the fucking"
2715.3199999999997,2716.3199999999997, foot every time.
2716.3199999999997,2719.3199999999997, Because you can't recover from that kind of reputation.
2719.3199999999997,2723.48," I mean, how good is how good can have to be now before any of us are going to get"
2723.48,2724.48, a shot.
2724.48,2727.44, This does hells into what's his name.
2727.44,2728.44, Ironlar guy said.
2728.44,2730.44," Oh, it's a three to no."
2730.44,2731.44, Yeah.
2731.44,2733.92," If we're, well, we don't keep going on this."
2733.92,2735.12," Well, it doesn't mean it's over."
2735.12,2736.12," No, no, okay."
2736.12,2737.12," This is a quick aside, really."
2737.12,2738.12, Yeah.
2738.12,2739.4, Give us a context on who this is.
2739.4,2742.92," So Michael Fitch, let's see from THQ, where did he come from?"
2742.92,2743.92," Yes, he came from THQ."
2743.92,2745.4," Well, Ironlar studio shut down."
2745.4,2750.08," The ones who did Titan Quest and the recent Soulstorm, I'm a expansion for Warhammer"
2750.08,2752.4," 40K, Don't Of War."
2752.4,2755.52, They shut down last week or they announced that they were shutting down.
2755.52,2759.1600000000003, So Michael Fitch posted on quarter to three forums.
2759.1600000000003,2763.0," Pretty much a big rant about, you know, he doesn't need it someplace to vent."
2763.0,2764.0, Yeah.
2764.0,2765.0, Right.
2765.0,2766.0, After this horrible thing happened.
2766.0,2767.0, Right.
2767.0,2768.2000000000003, He's been a longstanding quarter to three member.
2768.2000000000003,2774.6," And he's been very, very visible on those forums with in support of Titan Quest for"
2774.6,2777.12," a long time, like with gameplay tips and stuff."
2777.12,2779.08, So he's always been a great source.
2780.0,2785.36," He was talking about, you know, piracy always comes up as one of these things the developers"
2785.36,2787.2799999999997, are saying are killing PC gaming.
2787.2799999999997,2791.52, But he points out a specific thing that killed Titan Quest.
2791.52,2795.68," And that was people who were pirating their game, they had a copy protection built"
2795.68,2800.68, into the game where it would dump you out of the game and it looks like a crash.
2800.68,2804.52, So they were getting this horrible horrible reputation on the forums.
2804.52,2805.52," Oh, yes."
2805.52,2806.72, Because the game was crashing.
2806.7999999999997,2809.56, And it's also what has been attributed to part of the front lines problem.
2809.56,2810.24, Is that right?
2810.24,2812.04," Well, they're both THQ games."
2812.04,2813.48, So maybe it's the exact same.
2813.48,2816.9199999999996," If something that it sounds like Iron Lord is built into their game, right, but there"
2816.9199999999996,2819.4399999999996," was no message that said, like, you have a pirate and copy."
2819.4399999999996,2821.24, We're kicking you out because of this image is crashed.
2821.24,2825.2799999999997," But all of the people were playing, you know, if they were playing early, they were playing"
2825.2799999999997,2827.04," pirate and cops, right, go to forum."
2827.04,2828.04, I guess right.
2828.04,2829.04," And actually, this is a crash."
2829.04,2830.04, What a crappy game.
2830.04,2831.04, Right.
2831.04,2831.64, And he talks about it and has posted.
2831.64,2833.3599999999997, And so he was saying he said two things.
2833.3599999999997,2834.3599999999997, One is it.
2834.36,2838.92," But before the game was even released, you know, Titan Quest Replication was getting"
2838.92,2844.0," spread in the gaming community that it was buggy and crashy, which was only happening to"
2844.0,2846.36, them because they're playing fucking pirate copies.
2846.36,2847.36, That's far.
2847.36,2851.88," But then the other part, too, was he was talking about at least one totally vocal member who"
2851.88,2857.1600000000003," went on the official forums and did this whole rant about how, okay, yes, I did have a"
2857.1600000000003,2859.84," pirate copy, but I'm such a fan that I then went out."
2859.84,2866.2000000000003, And I bought the the the real retail copy and installed it and I'm having the same problems.
2866.2000000000003,2869.36," But as they kept talking to the sky and trying to figure out what went wrong, it turns"
2869.36,2875.2000000000003, out that he never got rid of everything off of the all of the pirate game.
2875.2000000000003,2880.0, So the problem never went away with the attributing to the pirate copy.
2880.0,2883.88, So I mean he kept the rewrite to the retail copy.
2883.88,2884.88, So right.
2884.88,2885.6000000000004," I mean, yeah, that's an example."
2885.6,2892.04," I mean, in Titan Quest case, you know, you don't know if that's all that went down here."
2892.04,2895.6," No, no, but that just, but it definitely just shone on the right."
2895.6,2896.6, The reputation you get.
2896.6,2901.4," Here's another little bit of information I want to share about I mean, piracy because"
2901.4,2902.4, you do it.
2902.4,2904.2," It's like, you know, that we don't want to blame everything."
2904.2,2909.0," I don't want to, there's no like single explanation for why games that ought to sell more"
2909.0,2911.8399999999997, don't sell.
2912.1600000000003,2914.96," On the piracy thing, you know, make of it what you will."
2914.96,2922.52," The guys at relic were telling me that they had over 800,000 downloads of their latest patch"
2922.52,2925.4, in just in China alone.
2925.4,2928.2000000000003," And of course, I mean, that's all there is in China's piracy."
2928.2000000000003,2929.2000000000003, This is of what?
2929.2000000000003,2930.2000000000003, That's the company.
2930.2000000000003,2931.2000000000003, The latest company here is patch.
2931.2000000000003,2932.56, And then that was just off.
2932.56,2938.6000000000004," So if you imagine 800,000 and if they had 800,000 extra sales to whatever they've done,"
2938.6000000000004,2940.28, the thing would be like multi-plat.
2940.28,2941.28, Yeah.
2941.28,2944.96," Also, it's like that's just from the official site."
2944.96,2949.1600000000003, And the majority of people in China don't get even patches and stuff from the official
2949.1600000000003,2950.1600000000003, site.
2950.1600000000003,2952.6400000000003, They get it from friends giving them links and stuff and just downloading it.
2952.6400000000003,2956.5600000000004, So that's part of the reason why they're making the Chinese version.
2956.5600000000004,2958.2400000000002," But that's not going to be, you don't buy the thing."
2958.2400000000002,2962.52," It's free and you pay through other means because it's like, I mean, there's so, there's"
2962.52,2966.5600000000004, so many potential sales that they're just losing on worldwide.
2966.5600000000004,2967.5600000000004, And that's just China.
2967.5600000000004,2968.5600000000004, So damn.
2969.56,2973.52," But on the front lines, I don't know how much else to say how much else I have to say"
2973.52,2974.52, about it.
2974.52,2978.16," I mean, I can talk about the single player, but other than to say that it's got the"
2978.16,2981.92," score it does and I would love to give it more and it's like they, I assume they're"
2981.92,2982.92, going to patch it.
2982.92,2983.92, They're used to that.
2983.92,2985.92, They're their monitors and they patched and updated.
2985.92,2987.7599999999998, Desert combat all the time.
2987.7599999999998,2989.0, The game just developed.
2989.0,2990.24, It got more maps.
2990.24,2996.12," All these things, I assume as much will happen for front lines if it sells well enough to justify."
2996.12,2999.64," But like you were saying at the same time, most people have already made up their mind."
2999.64,3004.52, I think if I wasn't so persistent because I had to just keep going back to it because I needed
3004.52,3007.12," to review it, that's why I tried so many different rigs."
3007.12,3008.6," It was like, okay, I can't stop."
3008.6,3010.72," But normally, I would have just uninstalled it."
3010.72,3013.52," And if I couldn't take it back, I would have just thrown it in the Empire."
3013.52,3015.88," Well, who has the time of patience for that nonsense?"
3015.88,3016.88, Right.
3016.88,3021.88," If the game doesn't work and you give it a good college try, I mean, fuck it."
3021.88,3026.96," I absolutely would, if I wasn't reviewing a game like that, I would give up and want my"
3026.96,3027.96, money back.
3027.96,3028.96, Yeah.
3028.96,3033.6," I mean, I used to say it at the magazine that I used to feel like any game like that should"
3033.6,3035.6, just get a zero.
3035.6,3041.28," It's like, if your product doesn't work, you compare it to, we have this kind of conversation"
3041.28,3042.28, all the time.
3042.28,3044.96, You compare it to any other product and any other business.
3044.96,3046.28, And it doesn't work.
3046.28,3047.8, You return the fucking thing.
3047.8,3049.2000000000003, Your refrigerator doesn't work.
3049.2,3051.2, You don't go in there and start fixing it yourself.
3051.2,3052.2, Yeah.
3052.2,3053.2, You know?
3053.2,3055.8399999999997," Well, I guess I'll just have my food half cold."
3055.8399999999997,3058.8399999999997, It doesn't really alway for them to put me my refrigerator pad.
3058.8399999999997,3061.8399999999997," But at least the door fits my milk nicely, even though it's going to spoil it."
3061.8399999999997,3062.8399999999997, Yeah.
3062.8399999999997,3063.8399999999997, The other thing.
3063.8399999999997,3064.8399999999997, It's not really their fault.
3064.8399999999997,3068.3199999999997, The other thing to come out of this is that the 360 version has got its own share
3068.3199999999997,3072.04, bugs and then like online latency issues and other performance things.
3072.04,3074.16, It's got its own host of browser problems.
3074.16,3077.52," And there, they're already talking about the patch too."
3077.52,3082.24," And that's funny because prior to the hard drives and stuff coming to consoles, everyone"
3082.24,3083.96, was worrying about this.
3083.96,3084.96," Well, it's great."
3084.96,3085.96, There's the whole debate.
3085.96,3087.48," Well, it's great to get these new Halo maps."
3087.48,3090.88, But it's the deal with the devil going to be that you're going to get these shitty
3090.88,3094.68," lawn games that come out and that you have to wait like, fuck four, three or four more"
3094.68,3095.96, months from actually working.
3095.96,3096.96, Yep.
3096.96,3097.96, It's my view.
3097.96,3098.96, The answer.
3098.96,3104.4," You know, and that's now they can suffer the same way we did."
3104.4,3105.4, Yeah.
3105.4,3106.4," Well, hey, it's not just the players."
3106.4,3107.96, It's everyone that loses in it.
3107.96,3108.96, Everyone.
3108.96,3112.6," So it's like again, the more of the story finished the fucking finish your fucking"
3112.6,3113.6, shit.
3113.6,3114.92, They work and then put them out.
3114.92,3115.92, Yep.
3115.92,3117.64," That's another one of my pet fives, pews."
3117.64,3122.84, The guys who get angry when a game gets delayed because it needs more time.
3122.84,3127.6800000000003," The guys who are going to boycott Blizzard, because of the latest Starcraft delay, whatever."
3127.6800000000003,3130.1600000000003," It's like, would you like them to put it out now on the finish?"
3130.1600000000003,3134.36, You're going to boycott because they're not getting a new product when they're going
3134.36,3135.36, to go out.
3135.36,3136.36," Yeah, they're not going to go out."
3136.36,3137.8, They're not spending a fine on that fan.
3137.8,3141.52, It's been that go go edit your fanfic for the next three months or whatever.
3141.52,3146.08," Speaking of fanfic, remember what you found with the frontlines, like the one good thing"
3146.08,3147.08, to come out of the frontlines.
3147.08,3148.08, Fanfic?
3148.08,3153.2400000000002, I spent time on the frontlines forms for the tech issues and they've got a designated
3153.2400000000002,3154.2400000000002, fanfic form.
3154.2400000000002,3155.2400000000002, Awesome.
3155.2400000000002,3158.88, I was surprised to see that it's got fanfic in it.
3158.88,3161.36, What this soon is our sex in it?
3161.36,3162.36, No.
3162.36,3164.36, I didn't even read that much.
3164.36,3166.36, It's just funny.
3166.36,3170.1200000000003," It's just like, yeah, just like the had a half-leaf shitting writing."
3170.1200000000003,3175.36," This one guy, he's like the first to post his videos in the moonlight sitting in the moonlight."
3175.36,3178.6800000000003, It's really like that.
3178.6800000000003,3180.92, So this fool post this thing.
3180.92,3182.6400000000003, And then he's even like critiquing himself.
3182.6400000000003,3185.6400000000003," He's like, it's pretty decent if you ask me."
3185.6400000000003,3188.6400000000003," Then someone else, then the next person post a story."
3188.6400000000003,3190.6400000000003, It's arguably better.
3190.6400000000003,3191.6400000000003," You know, whatever."
3191.64,3193.08," He's like, it's all right."
3193.08,3196.0," Your storylines are okay, but your storylines are cliche."
3196.0,3198.08, Like he says that like he keeps contradicting himself.
3198.08,3199.08, The same.
3199.08,3202.08," Yeah, so the guy who wrote the piece of shit first one is in there ripping on the next"
3202.08,3203.08, one.
3203.08,3204.08, And then he's the veteran.
3204.08,3207.96," And in addition, he tells him that his grammar is messed up all over the place."
3207.96,3211.92, So the first guy didn't even understand the fucking meaning of the word.
3211.92,3213.92," It's like, what are you talking about?"
3213.92,3219.08," On top of that, then one of the mods of the forum, his picture is a furry or something."
3219.08,3221.16," It's always telling him, like, this is good stuff."
3221.16,3222.16, Keep it coming.
3222.16,3223.16, Keep it coming.
3223.16,3224.16," Yeah, but that's his job."
3224.16,3225.16, I want to rip on that opportunity.
3225.16,3228.16, I can't excuse his furry avatar.
3228.16,3234.7599999999998," But I mean, that's pretty, that's his job is to get these kids to do what you're talking"
3234.7599999999998,3235.7599999999998, about our game.
3235.7599999999998,3238.04, And you're not bitching about the fact that it doesn't run.
3238.04,3239.04, Carry on.
3239.04,3242.68, I'm like two more stories.
3242.68,3243.68, Yeah.
3243.68,3244.68, Yeah.
3244.68,3245.68, What would the angry people?
3245.68,3248.68," What would it be like, what would you do if you could get this game running?"
3248.68,3250.68, That would be a good fan.
3250.68,3251.68," Well, play a happy customer."
3251.68,3253.68, She could both have fan-faceted.
3253.68,3257.68, Let's start off.
3257.68,3260.68," They're both in Starbucks on laptops, like next week's other."
3260.68,3263.68," So when you're right over there, you're right over there."
3263.68,3267.68, But you meet too.
3267.68,3273.68," So I did want to put in one little word for Iron Lord, just back to that."
3273.68,3275.68," Oh yeah, that I was."
3275.68,3277.68, Looks like another Gary Guygeck's moment.
3277.68,3279.68, Another loss for Iron Lord.
3279.68,3283.68," Because those guys were totally, were great developers."
3283.68,3284.68, Titan Quest.
3284.68,3290.68," And I think I said this at the time that we gave Titan Quest our RPG the year was it last year,"
3290.68,3294.68," 2006, I don't know, whatever."
3294.68,3302.68, That I felt like it was the first air-coated Diablo clone to be worthy of not actually being called that.
3302.68,3306.68, I felt like it was so much at a higher level than any other game.
3306.68,3311.68," And Diablo, that it was completely worth just not being stuck with that stupid little."
3311.68,3316.68, Really quality like World and Map editors too for users to create their own quests.
3316.68,3319.68," Yep, it had, yeah, it was like going for Quest."
3319.68,3322.68," Yeah, so it's probably you could increase the Titan Quest."
3322.68,3325.68, So you can probably still find it out there.
3325.68,3326.68, Sure.
3326.68,3327.68," Yes, you can."
3327.68,3328.68, You can probably steam is already on price.
3328.68,3329.68, It was on steam.
3329.68,3330.68, It was on steam.
3330.68,3335.68, If you have any interest in an action RPG Diablo's style gaming.
3335.68,3336.68, And didn't check it out.
3336.68,3337.68, I highly recommended.
3337.68,3341.68," Doesn't do the iron lower guys much good now, but it was a great game."
3341.68,3343.68," Last thing, I thought of it too late."
3343.68,3345.68, I always say the last thing.
3345.68,3350.68," For front lines, they need to add a class or like an unlock where it's like workhorse"
3350.68,3354.68," on it because you know, on the single player Anthony, it's like the whole story is told by the WorldCarsbundet."
3354.68,3355.68, You mean for fanfic?
3355.68,3359.68," Yeah, where you basically go laid out somewhere in the battlefield and you bring up your little"
3359.68,3360.68, little light.
3360.68,3361.68, Just take pictures for folks flying out.
3361.68,3366.68," And right, they can make a hit post and it puts sense out of the game and puts it right there on the form."
3366.68,3367.68, That'd be great.
3367.68,3370.68," So if I was like a war car spawn it, I could just like follow you around."
3370.68,3372.68," I could be like, yeah, you're banana right now."
3372.68,3374.68," How you feeling now, Mr. Royale?"
3374.68,3376.68," Dude, how to feel the shoot that guy."
3376.68,3383.68," If there's like opportunity for banana, I jokingly set up Anthony for the like the front lines version of banana writing."
3383.68,3384.68, Yeah.
3384.68,3386.68," And now it's like, you remember this, Anthony?"
3386.68,3389.68," Well, when I was holding the helicopter for you, like I'd said at the spawn."
3389.68,3391.68, Make sure you get the helicopter when it's snowing out there.
3391.68,3396.68," That too, but mainly when I'm like, all right, guys, I'm going to use the drone."
3396.68,3397.68, I want you to guard my body.
3397.68,3398.68, Oh yeah.
3398.68,3399.68," Oh, sure."
3399.68,3404.68, She just stay around and make sure no one shoots my body when I'm flying my drone.
3404.68,3407.68, Just keeps reminding me if I have kill rug.
3407.68,3409.68, I hate to say it.
3409.68,3413.68," Oh, the, or like spell quiet, a quiet, wow moment."
3413.68,3415.68," Yeah, the drones it operates on the game."
3415.68,3417.68," You're a buff of, let's take it back to Geigex."
3417.68,3419.68," That's a rip off of the eye, the holder isn't it?"
3419.68,3420.68, Mm-hmm.
3420.68,3421.68, The holder's an enemy.
3421.68,3422.68, Right.
3422.68,3425.68," I mean, you're not this is just a spell that you control it eye."
3425.68,3426.68, The eye has killed it.
3426.68,3428.68," Check guys, you didn't workcraft, too."
3428.68,3429.68," Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
3429.68,3430.68," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
3430.68,3431.68," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
3431.68,3432.68, It's been around for a while.
3432.68,3434.68, I know it was back and I should know this.
3434.68,3436.68," I mean, the design is obviously nothing special."
3436.68,3437.68, It's an eyeball.
3437.68,3438.68," Well, yeah."
3438.68,3439.68," Yeah, I don't mean the actual eye-flime."
3439.68,3440.68, I mean the mechanic.
3440.68,3441.68, Yeah.
3441.68,3446.68," I mean, it's purposes you're going to a separate mini avatar and control it for a while."
3446.68,3447.68, Right.
3447.68,3450.68," But you don't have any, you don't have any like, separate spells or anything."
3450.68,3451.68, You just find it.
3451.68,3452.68, Right.
3452.68,3453.68," No, that was an FPS."
3453.68,3455.68, You control a drone.
3455.68,3460.68," Enemy territory quickwares, but ultimately all conventions and shooters come back,"
3460.68,3466.68," held back to the fantasy world where in historical times a witch's familiar,"
3466.68,3467.68, you might be a raven or a cat.
3467.68,3469.68," And through these, she would see the world."
3470.68,3471.68, Keep going.
3471.68,3472.68, Keep going.
3472.68,3473.68, Keep going.
3473.68,3474.68, I got no more.
3474.68,3475.68, Got it.
3475.68,3478.68, That's trying to bring it back.
3478.68,3479.68, Got it.
3479.68,3481.68," So, lad, do you want to talk about some games that are coming out?"
3481.68,3482.68, Let's look at breakfast.
3482.68,3486.68," Oh, we'll take a break and we'll talk about, come back and talk about the future."
3486.68,3487.68," Yeah, yeah."
3487.68,3488.68, Good job.
3488.68,3489.68," Three, two, one."
3489.68,3490.68, You're the best.
3490.68,3491.68, All right.
3491.68,3493.68, Look at the matter.
3493.68,3498.68," Listen to EGM Live, the weekly podcast for electronic gaming monthly,"
3498.68,3506.68, available every Monday for download at EGM Live.1up.com or podcast.1up.com or the iTunes music store.
3506.68,3508.68, Sweet the leg.
3508.68,3510.68, Sweet the leg.
3510.68,3512.68, We're back.
3512.68,3517.68," We, during the break, we actually went into the future and we saw what is coming out."
3517.68,3519.68, So now we can report on what we saw.
3519.68,3520.68, Yeah.
3520.68,3522.68, Some more lost stuff again.
3522.68,3523.68, Yeah.
3523.68,3526.68, So what I already looking forward to the most.
3526.68,3527.68, I'm going to go first.
3527.68,3528.68," You go to fly minutes, silly."
3528.68,3530.68, Go to the board to go.
3530.68,3532.68, What do you think me for?
3532.68,3535.68, I'm saying that for not for left for dead.
3535.68,3537.68," That is, I think, number one PC game."
3537.68,3541.68," I mean, I, I, the obvious one for me would have been a lich king, but I won't go there."
3541.68,3542.68, Good.
3542.68,3544.68, But you're taking steps.
3544.68,3545.68, I am.
3545.68,3546.68, Thank you.
3546.68,3547.68, Even the less the truth.
3547.68,3551.68," But yeah, I want to play the hell out of left for dead."
3551.68,3555.68, And that's because I realize I just need more co-op games.
3555.68,3560.68," It's true, but at the same time, I know Sean's going to hate me for this, but there's like,"
3560.68,3562.68, that's one of those games I'm going to have to buy twice.
3562.68,3566.68," Because like, I want it for PC, obviously, to play with Sean and Roy and all of them."
3566.68,3570.68, But I have a lot of friends that don't play PC and they're going to want to play with me on 360.
3570.68,3571.68," Oh, man."
3571.68,3572.68, Take off your head.
3572.68,3573.68, So you're going to have to do that.
3573.68,3576.68," You're going to have to take your, you're going to have to take your friends, man."
3576.68,3578.68, It's like Orange Box.
3578.68,3582.68, This is the first thing I ever bought for both for that.
3582.68,3583.68, Honestly though.
3583.68,3588.68," I don't want to be like platform showmanist, but I think that game."
3588.68,3590.68," I don't know, man."
3590.68,3593.68," It's pretty nice to be able to like, oh, it's everything like square in the face."
3593.68,3594.68, The same way.
3594.68,3596.68," Oh, it's going to be made seems like a fast."
3596.68,3597.68," It's like, you just for friends."
3597.68,3601.68, And you know that they're designing it while they're making console version like the orange.
3601.68,3602.68, Right now.
3602.68,3605.68," Right now, we're always banning my IP from the trailer."
3605.68,3607.68, I'll try and connect tonight.
3607.68,3608.68, Yeah.
3608.68,3612.68, I can just picture like a moment where like you're free to being dragged up like the tongue news.
3612.68,3615.68, And you can't fucking hit the guys tongue and knock them back down.
3615.68,3616.68, Right.
3616.68,3620.68, The zombies are so fast and agile and they come from so many different directions.
3620.68,3623.68," And even the, well, the jumping is fine."
3623.68,3625.68, That works fine with the controller.
3625.68,3629.68," You know, if they put it on like this stick or something because you do want to, you like to get up on top of things a lot."
3629.68,3633.68," And, but you know, every time I played, it's like all about that."
3633.68,3634.68, That's part of the fun.
3634.68,3638.68," The simple fun is just like target acquisition and then just boom, nail them, boom."
3638.68,3643.68," And, but really rapidly because you know how many there are, you know, faster moving."
3643.68,3644.68, Yeah.
3644.68,3646.68," The fast zombies, not those slow down."
3646.68,3650.68," But yeah, but the cool cool up thing, I just more and more of these days."
3650.68,3651.68, Mm-hmm.
3651.68,3655.68, If a game is going to be just like me in front of the computer by myself.
3655.68,3658.68," And I think it just might be the situation I live in, you know."
3658.68,3661.68," But if like my boyfriend can't play with me, it's sometimes just like, ah, fuck this."
3661.68,3663.68, It's not going to be a single game.
3663.68,3664.68, It's hard to play a single game.
3664.68,3667.68," Even when I play stalker, I still sit there and vent with everyone a lot of times."
3667.68,3668.68," Yeah, really?"
3668.68,3669.68, Yeah.
3669.68,3670.68, Just because...
3670.68,3672.68," So, I don't have a hive mind to talk about."
3672.68,3673.68," So, yeah, I guess."
3673.68,3675.68," You should get in on our own or a cipher, man."
3675.68,3678.68," So, you guys are sometimes just sitting on vent just like the same thing."
3678.68,3679.68, Yeah.
3679.68,3680.68," Oh, yeah."
3680.68,3681.68, We're on the very cool.
3681.68,3683.68, Those fuckers were grinding loads of the rings.
3683.68,3686.68," And we're like, we just talked shit to each other."
3686.68,3689.68," Two of us are like, might be in company heroes or three of us."
3689.68,3692.68, We're screaming and yelling about all the shit we need to do there.
3692.68,3693.68, They're arguing about low-trou.
3693.68,3695.68, Someone else is playing Counter Strike and a tournament.
3695.68,3696.68, Like James.
3696.68,3699.68," See, that is a very uniquely PC thing."
3699.68,3700.68, You're just...
3700.68,3702.68," Yeah, it's a very modern world, too."
3702.68,3703.68, I approve.
3703.68,3704.68, That's fun.
3704.68,3707.68, I recommend that everyone do that.
3707.68,3709.68, Find a ventrilo or a team-speak cipher.
3709.68,3710.68, Play your games.
3710.68,3711.68," I mean, because yeah, because I was using..."
3711.68,3715.68," Well, for a while there, I was using MMOs, like, as the way I communicated with people."
3715.68,3716.68, I no longer lived near.
3716.68,3717.68," Like, sure."
3717.68,3718.68, We would play...
3718.68,3720.68, I've requested together or whatever.
3720.68,3722.68," It's like, you guys live across the country."
3722.68,3724.68, And this is the only time I ever talked to you.
3724.68,3726.68, Very modern.
3726.68,3728.68, I'm sorry that I said that I would...
3728.68,3730.68," Oh, I don't even care, dude."
3730.68,3731.68, I was just joking.
3731.68,3733.68, You could still get a ventrilo play on Xbox.
3733.68,3734.68, My point of view is...
3734.68,3737.68," Like I said, I really don't want to seem like platform-shown-ish on it."
3737.68,3741.68," It's just that, like, for me and talking to you, because I know you play PC shooters."
3741.68,3743.68," Yeah, the control isn't what it's about."
3743.68,3745.68, It gives you a really just-
3745.68,3748.68," Yeah, but for everyone else out there, dude, by all means, like,"
3748.68,3750.68," hop on, I'm sure it's gonna be great there, too."
3750.68,3751.68, It was talking for...
3751.68,3752.68," Just between us, man."
3752.68,3753.68, You're upsetting me.
3753.68,3754.68, I'm upsetting me.
3754.68,3755.68, I'm not doing men.
3755.68,3756.68, I'm not doing men.
3756.68,3757.68, I'm not doing men.
3757.68,3759.68, What are the games?
3759.68,3765.68," I'm looking forward to, uh, a left-for-date, and then, like, my version, of course, uh, of your guys,"
3765.68,3767.68," is Lord of the Rings, Lich King."
3767.68,3768.68, Is the...
3768.68,3769.68," Is Lord of the Rings, Lich King?"
3769.68,3770.68, Company heroes?
3770.68,3771.68, Eastern Frontest Fetchers.
3771.68,3777.68, It's all been confirmed when Josh was scared from where I was on the last week.
3777.68,3780.68, All but been confirmed meaning it hasn't officially been.
3780.68,3781.68, He kind of just...
3781.68,3782.68, Whatever.
3782.68,3783.68, I'm taking...
3783.68,3784.68, I'm choosing...
3784.68,3785.68, I'm choosing...
3785.68,3788.68," Yeah, I'm choosing to believe that this is what's coming next, and so that is..."
3788.68,3789.68, That's not pretty.
3789.68,3790.68, That's not pretty.
3790.68,3792.68," It'd be just my number one, most anticipated game."
3792.68,3794.68," But, uh, the..."
3794.68,3796.68," Fallout 3, I'm so excited for it."
3796.68,3803.68," And this is weird because I never played any fallout games, but I have seen it now, and I, like, you know, when they last brought it in, they showed us some of the gameplay."
3803.68,3810.68," But just the idea of, like, RPGs, now and then I'll really enjoy playing them, like Western style ones, you know?"
3810.68,3811.68, The...
3811.68,3813.68," The blivy and was great, and that was the last, you know, one really played."
3813.68,3820.68," But the thing is, is that they always have this, like, de facto, it's got to be 40 hours, or, like, I don't want to spend four hours."
3820.68,3821.68," Yeah, and it's..."
3821.68,3823.68," It's like, it's like an MMO and miniature, right?"
3823.68,3828.68," 40 hours of the same bullshit over and over again, with these artificially imposed, like, ways to keep you."
3828.68,3829.68, Mm-hmm.
3829.68,3830.68, Keep you playing.
3830.68,3839.68," But the whole point of, like, design direction with fall of 3 is to say, take this maybe it's just 20 hours max, but every decision and everything that goes in here is consequential."
3839.68,3849.68," It is meaningful to the outcome of the game, so it's, like, you know, if you play it again, the example that everyone's heard because they've showed us, you know, very little of the game at this point in time has been this town with a bomb in it."
3849.68,3865.68," And if you set off the atom bomb, the town's gone, if you diffuse it and keep it around the town's there, and that radically alters the outcome of, you know, your adventure, whether you accept subsequent missions inside that town, or whether you have to go elsewhere to do the things that you otherwise would have in that town."
3865.68,3870.68," So that notion of playing around, like, even if it's 10 hours, sounds fucking great to me."
3870.68,3876.68," You really fit, you should, I didn't know if it, you could still find it anywhere, but the first one for sure in the second one too."
3876.68,3878.68, And then you definitely worth playing.
3878.68,3883.68," They have, they just re-released them as, like, fall out one and two in a box set for, like, $19."
3883.68,3884.68, Jid Day.
3884.68,3885.68, It's absolutely worth it.
3885.68,3894.68," And for a lot of the reasons you're talking about, I mean, these are a couple of the RPGs that I remember where playing through more than once, absolutely could make a total difference."
3894.68,3898.68, And it makes a total difference in the way the game ultimately worked out in the end.
3898.68,3901.68, My other one making real choices in how the world would be.
3901.68,3906.68, My introduction to the Fallout universe was on the Xbox game Fallout Brotherhood of Steve.
3906.68,3908.68," Oh, yeah, that shit does what you have."
3908.68,3911.68," I know it's the town, but that game, it made a mind grinding."
3911.68,3912.68, Yeah.
3912.68,3915.68," It was like the very first level, it was kill scorpions."
3915.68,3916.68, I'm not lying.
3916.68,3922.68," So you kill scorpions, and then the first dungeon is to go into the dungeon and eradicate all, like, whatever, 100 scorpions."
3922.68,3924.68, You have to get every last one.
3924.68,3927.68," And then when you do, you're treated to a boss fight with a giant scorpion."
3927.68,3931.68," Well, I will tell you that you will kill scorpions and fall out one and two."
3931.68,3935.68," However, don't forget, this was 1998."
3935.68,3936.68, And it looked cool.
3936.68,3937.68, Yes.
3937.68,3941.68," You could choose to aim at there like antenna or, you know, right, that's how it worked back and forth."
3941.68,3943.68," For my guess, it's bitter, right."
3943.68,3945.68, And it wasn't really grinding.
3945.68,3947.68, Those aren't actual grinding then.
3947.68,3949.68, You weren't doing repetitive tasks then.
3949.68,3952.68, You were just making a way to maps.
3952.68,3953.68, Yeah.
3953.68,3954.68, The way it looked to it.
3954.68,3956.68, The random encounters if we were wondering the desert too.
3956.68,3957.68, There were random encounters.
3957.68,3958.68, Yeah.
3958.68,3966.68," Three, it has like the Deus Ex, BioShock vibe, where, you know, like, the example to show you're trying to get through the subway and there's these automated ticket takers."
3966.68,3978.68," But then there's also, you know, like mutants rolling around through there, and you're able to actually reprogram the automated ticket taker to let you through and then protect you and, or you could do something else."
3978.68,3980.68, You could fight it and all that just seemed cool.
3980.68,3984.68," I mean, every bit about it, there was so much and like BioShock, it had the art direction down there."
3984.68,3985.68," Like, let's think about this."
3985.68,3988.68," What is, you know, how are we going to communicate information in this game?"
3988.68,3995.68, The whole way that it sets you up that you're actually born in there and that you choose your appearance when you're looking at photos of your childhood and stuff.
3995.68,4000.68," Very, you know, perfectly natural integration of backstory into the actual gameplay."
4000.68,4005.68," And then, just the art direction."
4006.68,4010.68," You can, you can glimpse at the world and it communicates what this place is, what it's about."
4010.68,4022.68," And it's not just here's a generic wasteland with scorpions, giant scorpions and shit in it, but like, it's very specifically built on kind of like 50s, you know, world of tomorrow type shit, but given a dystopian, dystopian veneer."
4022.68,4031.68," I think it has, it looks, I mean, I don't know, it may be it'll suck, but everything I've seen so far just gives me reason to be excited about it is what I'm saying."
4031.68,4040.68," And then the other thing, or that cheat and say, too is because basically, if you give you guys chance, maybe Anthony talk about soccer if you wanted, but um, stalker clear skies."
4040.68,4048.68," I said they don't know enough about it, but it's like one of those games that just over the year, I keep thinking about it and like, you know what?"
4048.68,4052.68, That was really one of the greatest gaming experience I had last year.
4052.68,4059.68," And you're like, because you're not remembering, you know, you're more charitable and retrospective, you're not remembering all the times it crashed on you are the bugs or some of the annoying stuff, you know."
4059.68,4071.68," And you're just thinking about like, the experience of being in that game world stuck with me, like how creepy it was or how atmospheric it was and the cool thing is going on there and I'm glad that they're making another one."
4071.68,4074.68, You had great stories about it back when we were podcasting about it.
4074.68,4081.68," Yeah, I also like did that was another thing where it was like I gave it an eight and it was kind of like I don't know if people thought that that wasn't a high score because of the usual, why so low thing."
4081.68,4096.68, It was it's a great game. I'm really tempted to go back and play it and then Robert Ashley's also playing it now and he he told me that he was up to 4 a.m. last night because he went to bed couldn't stop thinking about it and said fuck it got up back back on.
4096.68,4097.68, Damn.
4097.68,4099.68," Hi, praise and deed."
4099.68,4101.68, I gotta play that that's on my that's on that.
4101.68,4102.68, I'm still there.
4102.68,4108.68," But I almost like I installed it and I keep almost playing it, but then I'm just like, no, I want to do something."
4108.68,4110.68, I think I'm going to go have a pop PC.
4110.68,4111.68, Some stuff.
4111.68,4112.68, It's so bad.
4112.68,4114.68," Yeah, there's so many awesome."
4114.68,4119.68," Just like even that first, you know, just the first part, I know like it was bringing the memories back when it was talking about about it."
4119.68,4131.68," The first section you come out and you need to cross basically either underneath this real bridge or up over the hill and it's got, you know, these various things to keep doing it and like you can go and fight the guards."
4131.68,4133.68, You could bribe the guards.
4133.68,4151.68," There's this other tunnel you can go through, but it's loaded with atmospheric anomalies and you got to look at PDAs and stuff and find out what the other guy's research about how he got through there and work it out like puzzle or you just look around the environment long enough just being explore and you can just find a way that you can just get right through on your own and that kind of thing is just it's just great."
4151.68,4153.68," I don't know, I just love that type of game."
4153.68,4162.68," I'm like this everything and then the next step, it's like you you encounter some guy playing guitar in a shitty house and he talks to you or he tries to trick you and it's like it's just it's so organic and natural the way that one."
4162.68,4177.68, thing leads to another and there's never this sense of this is the exact story so I wanted to tell me they're so determined to tell it to me in this specific order and make sure that I didn't miss a single thing that it just feels stale and like very ungame like.
4177.68,4181.68," Oh, yeah, that's my second recommendation for that game."
4181.68,4182.68, Cool.
4182.68,4183.68, Anthony.
4183.68,4184.68, Starcraft 2.
4184.68,4186.68, It's what I'm looking forward to.
4186.68,4187.68," Okay, fair enough."
4188.68,4192.68," I mean, I do like, or what are you saying, you want me to talk about stocker?"
4192.68,4193.68," No, no, that's like perfect."
4193.68,4195.68," I'm saying, I'm glad you brought it up."
4195.68,4197.68," Yeah, I mean, I'm just going to be mine."
4197.68,4198.68, You beat me to it.
4198.68,4203.68," I mean, I'm not really looking forward to the multiplayer only because I wasn't I was never good at the multiplayer the first one."
4203.68,4207.68, But that those games like the Blizzard RTS games even workcraft 3.
4207.68,4210.68, I like like from start to finish just for the single player.
4210.68,4212.68, So the single player campaigns are awesome.
4212.68,4213.68, I really good.
4213.68,4220.68," Like even that one they did for a Warcraft 3, which was like that one that was download only where you played is the Beast Master guy."
4220.68,4221.68, I can't remember.
4221.68,4222.68, I can't play that one.
4222.68,4223.68," Oh, yeah, Rex R. Yeah."
4223.68,4224.68, Who you see.
4224.68,4226.68, Who you see.
4226.68,4227.68, I see one.
4227.68,4228.68, He wanders.
4228.68,4230.68, He wanders that one's and I can't think what's called.
4230.68,4233.68," But yeah, I'm just saying like they've always had really good stories."
4233.68,4241.68, So and just what I've seen like learning more about the characters and the way they've changed since the last expansion 10 years ago.
4241.68,4248.68, They showed at BlizzCon for the single player campaign gave me serious and I mean this in all the good ways and not the bad ways.
4248.68,4254.68, Wing commander vibes like the way they set up the ship and how in between exactly you get to go in the ship.
4254.68,4261.68, You're wandering in between all the different you know very familiar decks and then people had moved around and they have you know new stories to tell you.
4261.68,4266.68, I thought it was daring for them especially to do to go in that direction.
4266.68,4277.68, Like I definitely had a sort of crumudgently like what why are you changing things so you know and I know I wasn't the only one in the room at BlizzCon you felt that way.
4277.68,4285.68, I mean I have faith that they'll pull it off but that was they're really taking that that presentation in a different direction with that campaign.
4285.68,4290.68," Yeah, I mean the presentation in the other one was always very linear and straightforwardly."
4290.68,4291.68, Very weird.
4291.68,4296.68, And these specific story sequences you played out but I'm kind of curious how that played out.
4296.68,4311.68, Yeah and I'm interested to see like the way that the fighting has changed because you know they're making more use of terrain rather than it's just that there's a ramp that you can get onto a higher level having the units that can traverse train and stuff.
4311.68,4313.68, I think it's going to make a really big difference.
4313.68,4315.68, Hopefully that comes out this year.
4315.68,4319.68, Most people in the office don't seem to think it's going to be an O8 game.
4319.68,4322.68, Yeah and when it's probably with them really think so.
4322.68,4329.68, Really the screens I mean that that just I don't know if their bull shots are not but the screens make it look like it's pretty pretty.
4329.68,4334.68, Sure but they take a lot of time with their beta testing which they haven't even started yet.
4334.68,4339.68, But you know they're also trying to get a litch king out the door and they very traditionally go one game at a time.
4339.68,4342.68, Well in litch king seems like the more obvious choice for them.
4342.68,4346.68, I mean starcraft two will sell whenever but they already have some subscribers.
4346.68,4350.68, You think they would sit on because they obviously two separate teams working out.
4350.68,4354.68, I mean they saw them cross over like you know with the big guys like Metson and Parano or Paralympic and both.
4354.68,4359.68, But you think they would sit on starcraft two if it wasn't ready if litch king was coming out the same month.
4359.68,4361.68, I don't think they do know.
4361.68,4362.68, I don't think they would.
4362.68,4363.68, I think they would.
4363.68,4364.68, I think they would.
4364.68,4365.68, I think they would.
4365.68,4367.68, I think they would.
4367.68,4368.68, I mean they would they would.
4368.68,4369.68, I know I'm think they would.
4369.68,4370.68, I know I think they would.
4370.68,4371.68, I'm just joking.
4371.68,4374.68, I have no idea what activation thinks of an idea.
4374.68,4377.68," Oh, that's what I'm looking for right."
4377.68,4378.68, What's the connection?
4378.68,4382.68," I mean, but if you've got two games and the right card."
4382.68,4384.68," Yeah, they know that's a marketable studio."
4384.68,4389.68, I don't think they'd be they'd be too heard if they decided that they were capable of putting out two games a year.
4389.68,4390.68," Yeah, right."
4390.68,4392.68, Luckily for that game I have enough.
4392.68,4396.68, And a friend's interested because it like like you whenever I went online
4396.68,4399.58," line it was just like, screw this, I can't play."
4399.58,4400.9800000000005," Yeah, I would never play much."
4400.9800000000005,4403.4400000000005, Incredibly awesome gaming memories.
4403.4400000000005,4407.62, Without doing it over land in our house with six other people.
4407.62,4409.12," Plus, it was awesome."
4409.12,4412.18, I hope there's a really good map editor in it because it was always cool.
4412.18,4416.72," The first time around to see like, like, I never played like when I would play"
4416.72,4417.400000000001, multiple of that.
4417.400000000001,4421.34," It seems we didn't even play traditional like, like, quick matches where we were"
4421.34,4422.76, just fighting each other.
4422.76,4427.08," We'd always do like the ones that were like, I don't know, tailored around like a"
4427.08,4428.72, theme or something like that.
4428.72,4431.16," Like, just seeing what the people would create."
4431.16,4434.56," Like where it might just be like, you have like two really powerful space means"
4434.56,4439.8," and you have to hold out against like waves of you know, I can't believe you're suggesting"
4439.8,4440.8, that.
4440.8,4445.2," And like, unless they have to have something in place where like someone on their"
4445.2,4449.320000000001, forums or something could teach them and there's some kind of like score.
4449.320000000001,4450.320000000001, You can attach to them.
4450.4,4452.28," Because otherwise, you just make stacked maps."
4452.28,4455.599999999999," It would be like, there's a co-level editor and it would be like if we made one"
4455.599999999999,4457.88, with like a plus 60 fuel right out there.
4457.88,4458.88, I don't know that.
4458.88,4460.12, But these ones are all plus five.
4460.12,4464.04," Yeah, but these ones were these ones were always just people versus PC and stuff like"
4464.04,4465.04, that.
4465.04,4467.599999999999," Like they would make like, yeah, they would make like weird theme to one's."
4467.599999999999,4468.599999999999, Yeah.
4468.599999999999,4469.599999999999, Yeah.
4469.599999999999,4470.599999999999, No.
4470.599999999999,4471.599999999999, Because I was in areas.
4471.599999999999,4472.599999999999," Once in workcraft, too."
4472.599999999999,4474.12," Well, but plus I mean labeled the server high gold."
4474.12,4478.08," I think I've told this for, but just I'd not to you labeled the server high gold."
4478.16,4482.16," And then of course, the mind's got like two, two fucking clean get it to."
4482.16,4486.0, But I'm just saying like the ones that are really good will get passed around.
4486.0,4489.6, Like I just think that some point the community also weeds out a lot of them.
4489.6,4490.6," Yeah, that's what I mean."
4490.6,4492.48, They have some sort of like community filter.
4492.48,4493.28, I would like that.
4493.28,4495.92," I mean, that would be cool to have more maps."
4495.92,4498.6," But then again, it's tough when you want to play an RTS competitively."
4498.6,4502.4, I don't know if Starcraft is that way that is map knowledge like all important.
4502.4,4503.08," Oh, of course."
4503.08,4503.28, Yeah.
4503.28,4503.64, Okay.
4503.64,4504.64, So there's there's gold.
4504.64,4506.28, There's only so many that you want to learn.
4506.28,4510.599999999999," And if you're going to invest your time learning it, you want to be sure that other people are going to want to play it."
4510.599999999999,4511.599999999999," You know, right."
4511.599999999999,4511.96, Right.
4511.96,4512.16, Right.
4512.16,4515.4," Knowing which crystals to go for and which, you know, best peeing."
4515.4,4516.92, I just didn't play Starcraft for that.
4516.92,4517.92, Yeah.
4517.92,4522.36," Well, I mean, dude, even, well, you will, when we play the win, that's competitively."
4522.36,4523.36, Yeah.
4523.36,4526.5599999999995," Even against friends like tournament, you're advancing at the same pace."
4526.5599999999995,4527.5599999999995, Okay.
4527.5599999999995,4529.4," Like when we play, we don't we want to win."
4529.4,4530.719999999999," Yeah, but we just,"
4530.719999999999,4532.2," Oh, it's totally different world."
4532.2,4533.5199999999995, It's not a same box.
4533.5199999999995,4536.24," I never, I never felt like I was going to have an end."
4536.24,4537.88, I've been in your eyes and playing Starcraft.
4537.88,4540.48, There are times of company here.
4540.48,4543.44, That you guys are like Anthony is still there.
4543.44,4545.44, And it's because I'm sitting there talking to myself.
4545.44,4548.92, I remember maybe we're going to play Starcraft and the shot.
4548.92,4550.679999999999," Yeah, that's what's telling you to get in the cycle with us."
4550.679999999999,4552.48, There's times you don't want to be in there.
4552.48,4553.48, Yeah.
4553.48,4555.0, Because people start losing their shit.
4555.0,4557.2," And it's like, all of us get quiet."
4557.2,4559.639999999999, And there's just one person fucking screaming and ranting.
4559.639999999999,4560.96," Oh, and the rest of us are quiet."
4560.96,4566.12," And we're all wanting to say we're waiting for someone to be like, well, because we're having a gaming tantrum."
4566.12,4567.599999999999," Yeah, I turn my gun fed."
4567.599999999999,4568.599999999999, It's not just a game.
4568.599999999999,4569.599999999999, It's just a game.
4569.599999999999,4570.599999999999, Yeah.
4570.599999999999,4571.599999999999, Yeah.
4571.599999999999,4572.599999999999," Yeah, you're struggling."
4572.599999999999,4575.24, I don't press my talk button when I'm doing that.
4575.24,4576.24," Oh, when you're having a game."
4576.24,4577.24, Leave that to myself.
4577.24,4578.24," Yeah, I used to have it."
4578.24,4580.599999999999, We used to play poker with all this guys.
4580.599999999999,4582.36, I used to play cards with all these guys.
4582.36,4584.92, And those one guy who would always be having fucking rage fits.
4584.92,4585.92, War.
4585.92,4590.36," And you know, we're talking like, you know, nickel-dime quarter."
4590.36,4592.24," So we're not, it's not high money."
4592.24,4593.88," These are, we're all working guys."
4593.88,4594.88, All adults.
4594.88,4596.76," You know, he's got a decent job."
4596.76,4600.92," And he gets in this thing where he's like, the cards are against him."
4600.92,4602.24, But he's saying it out loud.
4602.24,4603.52," Like, there it is again."
4603.52,4605.24, I can't get three of a kind.
4605.24,4606.24, Did that go?
4606.24,4607.24, Exactly.
4607.24,4608.24," You know, that kind of thing."
4608.24,4610.6," And where he's like, basically hijacked to the whole experience."
4610.6,4614.92," Because we're all sitting there like, you know, and like every hand starts to being about"
4614.92,4615.92, him.
4615.92,4618.76," Of course, once again, I can't get the straight."
4618.76,4622.36," And we're like, dude, first of all, you lost 50 fucking cents."
4622.36,4623.36, Okay?
4623.36,4624.36, That's all you lost.
4624.44,4625.36, 50 cents.
4625.36,4626.36, That's not going to fall.
4626.36,4629.44, Six other people at the same table also lost.
4629.44,4632.639999999999, Only one guy won the hand.
4632.639999999999,4634.96, So it's not just about you losing the hand every time.
4634.96,4635.96," Oh, god."
4635.96,4637.96," Tell me, sorry, I'm ran because I know."
4637.96,4638.96," No, go."
4638.96,4639.96, It does.
4639.96,4642.12," It just, that kind of poor sportsmanship pisses me off so much."
4642.12,4645.36," It's like, if you're not prepared to lose, then quit."
4645.36,4646.36, Yeah.
4646.36,4647.799999999999," You know, because you're going to lose."
4647.799999999999,4650.2, Sometimes it's fun though to egg them on like a share.
4650.2,4654.32," I used to love doing a fighting games when you just, do you be the, I don't know,"
4654.32,4655.84, I'm not saying it would be as whole.
4655.84,4659.12, Now I'm all self-conscious about it because people post on forums about how I'm in
4659.12,4660.12, asshole.
4660.12,4661.12," Like, no, I say things to you."
4661.12,4662.12," Like, I saw someone with this thread."
4662.12,4665.12," Someone was like, yeah, they were talking about how they fell asleep with"
4665.12,4666.12, their computers.
4666.12,4669.719999999999," Oh, I saw this fucking caustic asshole compared to cheating their pants."
4669.719999999999,4671.44," It's like, you guys know me."
4671.44,4672.719999999999, You know that it's totally joke.
4672.719999999999,4674.4," It's like, I'm not like, I don't really care."
4674.4,4675.5599999999995, I don't really think that up.
4675.5599999999995,4676.5599999999995," Well, we played with some."
4676.5599999999995,4677.5599999999995, Or we might.
4677.5599999999995,4678.5599999999995, We had a great way of it.
4678.5599999999995,4679.5599999999995, We fell asleep with the computer.
4679.5599999999995,4681.0, You know how superior I am in you?
4681.0,4682.0," Like, there's none of that."
4682.0,4684.2, And the other side of it is I might agree with you.
4684.76,4685.679999999999," Okay, they're side of it."
4685.679999999999,4688.12," As if I'm falling asleep with my computer playing a game,"
4688.12,4689.679999999999, that's kind of a sad moment in my life.
4689.679999999999,4691.04," Yeah, we could make fun of it."
4691.04,4692.84, But people I'm willing to admit that.
4692.84,4694.5599999999995, Apparently they're close to home for that guy.
4694.5599999999995,4695.88," Yeah, they don't understand it."
4695.88,4696.679999999999, It just don't get this.
4696.679999999999,4699.72," So, but so the story I'm telling,"
4699.72,4701.12," but I think, oh, that's the thing."
4701.12,4701.8, What a prick.
4701.8,4703.5599999999995," But you know, you're playing fighting for the friend."
4703.5599999999995,4706.5599999999995," And it ultimately works because when there is so pissed off,"
4706.5599999999995,4708.639999999999," you're just like, how does it feel just to be like,"
4708.639999999999,4709.16, you have a tip?
4709.16,4712.24," Like, have you ever, have you ever imagined what it's like to win?"
4712.24,4714.719999999999, Do you ever just think about how it feels to win a game?
4714.719999999999,4716.719999999999," Yeah, I mean, just talk to him like that entire time."
4716.719999999999,4719.84," And eventually, then they just like have to laugh, you know?"
4719.84,4720.96, Or they don't have to.
4720.96,4723.04," Or then they start challenging, you know, fist fight,"
4723.04,4725.0, which is happening a few times over like Mortal Kombat
4725.0,4725.84, and stuff like that.
4725.84,4729.16," Yeah, there's one guy in computer gaming world in the old days."
4729.16,4731.719999999999, We used to all be really into high heat baseball.
4731.719999999999,4734.32, The time that was good on the PC from 3D.
4734.32,4736.32," Oh, there was a year or two there where that was just"
4736.32,4738.04, the greatest PC baseball game.
4738.04,4740.84, And it was so good that the entire staff played.
4740.84,4742.24, And we had like a lead going on.
4742.24,4744.92," And this is people who weren't even in the sports or baseball,"
4744.92,4748.24, but the game was just so fun that we set up a lead.
4748.24,4749.6, And I don't want to name them.
4749.6,4751.2, You might listen to the podcast.
4751.2,4753.32," You know, I actually love you, man."
4753.32,4754.4800000000005, But you kind of a poor.
4754.4800000000005,4757.76," So that story that you heard, huh?"
4757.76,4760.360000000001, That involves naming names.
4760.360000000001,4761.360000000001, Which one?
4761.360000000001,4764.04, We'll have to go off my camera and post.
4764.04,4765.2," Oh, that's something else."
4765.2,4766.4800000000005," Yeah, okay."
4766.4800000000005,4768.4800000000005, But on the other side.
4768.4800000000005,4769.96, On the baseball thing.
4769.96,4773.6," This guy, he was poor sport in that same way."
4773.6,4777.28, Because we would do is just one on one matches.
4777.28,4778.32, But we would play them.
4778.32,4780.92," So like the whole, especially as a season was winding down"
4780.92,4783.96," to baseball season, our league baseball season was winding down."
4783.96,4785.44, And every game was important.
4785.44,4789.24, And so you hear this guy versus this person was up.
4789.24,4790.64, And so we'd all be in there watching
4790.64,4792.36, because it would be epic.
4792.36,4795.2, And this one dude was such a poor sport.
4795.2,4796.6, He was just a classic.
4796.6,4800.96," Like if he was winning, he could not stop the trash talking."
4800.96,4803.92," And he'd be like, oh, yeah, there it is again."
4803.92,4804.92," Oh, yeah."
4804.92,4808.280000000001," You know, because they went to the game when replay big moments"
4808.280000000001,4809.280000000001, in the game.
4809.280000000001,4810.6, And he would make you sit through it.
4810.6,4812.6," No, but you could just get the ass like, you know,"
4812.6,4814.280000000001," the announcer is saying, did you hear that?"
4814.280000000001,4815.4800000000005, You're talking about me?
4815.4800000000005,4816.4800000000005, Right.
4816.4800000000005,4817.4800000000005, He's not talking about you.
4817.4800000000005,4818.4800000000005, Right.
4818.4800000000005,4822.88," But if he was on the losing end, not only would he just be"
4822.88,4825.96, utterly quiet and like his face would be all beat red.
4825.96,4829.36, But if like the other person who was who was beating him would be
4829.36,4831.32," like getting those moments, he'd be just be going, push the"
4831.32,4833.32," button, push the button, skip it."
4833.32,4834.32, We don't need to see this.
4834.32,4838.08, And he had no self-conscious awareness of the discrepancy
4838.08,4840.8, between the way he was acting when he was winning or losing.
4840.8,4844.28," To the point where, you know, it was no fun, what first it was"
4844.28,4846.4800000000005, no fun playing him because he would be that way and you just
4846.4800000000005,4847.72," be like, I'm sorry."
4847.72,4849.96, I'm beating you dude like Jesus.
4849.96,4851.72," You know, I would lose."
4851.72,4852.4, I would lose.
4852.4,4853.52, So you would be happier.
4853.52,4854.68, So we could all be happier.
4854.68,4856.16, But actually I'd like to win.
4856.16,4859.240000000001, But he was actually so bad at it that it did kind of get that way.
4859.240000000001,4861.92, It would get to where like he'd be getting his ass kicked and all
4861.92,4862.52, the rest of us.
4862.52,4866.200000000001, We'd like a couple of us would be outside there and I'm going good.
4866.200000000001,4869.16, And then we'd go in and we'd all be sort of enjoying his tantrum.
4869.16,4873.240000000001, And there was one day where there was one woman on the staff at the
4873.240000000001,4874.64, time who was a cop yetter.
4874.64,4878.360000000001," And she was, and just, it's just so I worked out."
4878.360000000001,4880.52," It's a stereotype, but it's just the way it was."
4880.52,4883.8," In this particular case, she was terrible at it."
4883.8,4885.04, She didn't know baseball.
4885.04,4888.4400000000005," So, you know, I hate to say it, but it was like quote unquote kind of like"
4888.4400000000005,4891.92," typical girl, you know, you had to be a little bit like, here's how I"
4891.92,4893.76," don't, I'm putting that in big quotes."
4893.76,4895.08, It's just creating a hustle.
4895.08,4898.360000000001," She was absolutely that like, well, what does that guy do?"
4898.360000000001,4899.76," You know, that's the picture."
4899.76,4900.4400000000005, That sort of thing.
4900.4400000000005,4902.04, So she wasn't very good.
4902.04,4904.92, And she was only in it because the whole staff was doing it.
4904.92,4907.4800000000005," So when you played a game against her, you would just go easy on it."
4907.4800000000005,4911.04," Because she wasn't really in competition, right?"
4911.04,4912.12, So you don't apologize for it.
4912.12,4914.12," Like, she snucked in high heat."
4914.12,4915.32, And she was a woman.
4915.32,4919.84, I've lived in Berkeley too.
4919.84,4920.84, I lived in Berkeley too.
4920.84,4921.84," I lived in, okay."
4921.84,4923.4," Man, this kick sucks."
4923.4,4924.4, Okay.
4924.4,4930.84," So anyway, so that was one game where it was just one of those horrible, the stars were"
4930.84,4933.44, a line sort of thing where she goes in there.
4933.44,4935.84, She's up against this guy.
4935.84,4938.5599999999995, And she starts randomly kicking his ass.
4938.5599999999995,4941.92, It's just one of those moments where he just like a pitcher who's having a in real
4941.92,4944.08," life, who just can't throw straight."
4944.08,4945.36, He just having one of those days.
4945.36,4947.2," Well, this guy was having one of those."
4947.2,4948.52, And he was getting his ass kicked.
4948.52,4949.96, And it was going all around the floor.
4949.96,4951.84," Like, oh my god, she's kicking Dave's ass."
4951.84,4952.84," Well, I said his name."
4952.84,4954.84, I'm taking his ass.
4954.84,4957.28," So he was, and he was getting more and more map."
4957.28,4960.68, But he was so mad that he couldn't say anything.
4960.68,4963.0," Instead of, he couldn't even do it like push a button."
4963.0,4964.68, He was sitting there like taking his lobster.
4964.68,4966.4800000000005, He was like beaten down as a human.
4966.4800000000005,4967.4800000000005, Nice.
4967.4800000000005,4968.76, And then the game ended and he just walked it.
4968.76,4970.36, He threw the controller.
4970.36,4972.04, And they threw it gently.
4972.04,4973.04, Walked out of the room.
4973.04,4974.04, And we're all just sitting there.
4974.04,4974.88, He hasn't said one word.
4974.88,4977.32, And then we hear boom.
4977.32,4981.599999999999, When he gets outside and he had kicked his trash can basically in half.
4981.599999999999,4983.24, He kicked his soul hard.
4983.24,4984.24, Wow.
4984.24,4985.24, Right.
4985.24,4986.24, Yeah.
4986.24,4988.24," It's like, we had this like in office."
4988.24,4989.24, So caliber two tournament.
4989.24,4993.24," And I was telling like, Kimmy, who is a community manager at the time to play the character"
4993.24,4994.24, Raphael.
4994.24,4997.679999999999," And if you just hold forward and mesh, it was like, may or be."
4997.679999999999,4999.5599999999995, And you just basically do a series of pokes.
4999.56,5002.160000000001," You're able to like as soon as you're done, there's a slight pause."
5002.160000000001,5005.360000000001, And then you resume another series of like advancing pokes.
5005.360000000001,5007.72, And so she beat a few people in the tournament that way.
5007.72,5009.120000000001, And then she got the shoe.
5009.120000000001,5011.320000000001, Who's actually a good soak up player.
5011.320000000001,5015.56," And he was one of the hopefuls for, you know, likely to be in the finals."
5015.56,5018.56, And I think it was like the first to win three games.
5018.56,5020.72, And she beat him to the first two.
5020.72,5021.72, And then he turned it around.
5021.72,5023.64, But he was like sweating all the time.
5023.64,5024.96, Just from that same bullshit.
5024.96,5029.320000000001," And then all around like I was standing and getting everyone to go like, hey, hey, hey,"
5030.32,5031.5199999999995," hey, hey, hey."
5032.92,5036.719999999999," Again, I got tons of situations, but specifically with fighting games,"
5036.719999999999,5039.16, we're like someone steps in and there's a total button mask.
5039.16,5040.12, You have no idea what they're doing.
5040.12,5040.719999999999, Yeah.
5040.719999999999,5043.719999999999, And they're beating like the one who's always playing the same character and always wins.
5043.719999999999,5048.24," And they're just like, it's up, it is tough because sometimes a true"
5048.24,5052.96, measure who's just like really going all over the buttons is so.
5052.96,5054.4, There absolutely unpredictable.
5054.4,5054.679999999999, Mm-hmm.
5054.679999999999,5058.4, They're also no fun because right because you can't you can't psych them out.
5058.48,5061.32," I mean, though all the fun of so-called reason conditioning people, right?"
5061.32,5064.599999999999," So you hit them with the series of high, I mean, this is a rudimentary example."
5064.599999999999,5067.28, You hit them with the series of high texts until they learn to block high.
5067.28,5070.0," Then you hit them with a low throw like if you're nightmare or something,"
5070.0,5073.44, or you hit them with like a low attack or a mid attack or a crumple stun or something.
5073.44,5076.5599999999995, Or vice versa you do with low is but you can't condition a measure.
5076.5599999999995,5080.96, And you can't like predict like you can't they're not going to fall into a pattern
5080.96,5084.5199999999995, where you can start like garden pack them or side step them and counter.
5084.5199999999995,5085.5599999999995, So they're no fun to play it all.
5085.5599999999995,5087.5199999999995," Yeah, they totally can upset."
5087.52,5088.360000000001, And then it's annoying.
5088.360000000001,5091.84, Would you fucking didn't it's not always like your specific characters where it worked.
5091.84,5093.080000000001, I really well with it.
5093.080000000001,5095.080000000001, That's again a play I am.
5095.080000000001,5098.200000000001, I don't really play that genre and everyone's in a while.
5098.200000000001,5100.4800000000005," Not so much anymore but like back on the first song,"
5100.4800000000005,5104.4400000000005, Robert and Salt Cowbert 2 came out and I would hang out with like the OPM guys who would ever
5104.4400000000005,5106.4400000000005, and they would have me play and I didn't.
5106.4400000000005,5108.6, I literally I didn't know what anything did.
5108.6,5111.96, I just be holding the control and just hating every button and sometimes I'd win.
5111.96,5113.64," No, like that's this is cool."
5113.64,5115.280000000001, It happens the times that way.
5115.280000000001,5116.280000000001, Yep.
5116.28,5121.639999999999," Like yeah, it's not like an FPS or an RTS where."
5121.639999999999,5123.5199999999995, Machineink and the do shit for it.
5123.5199999999995,5126.92, There was an incident with a dead ero I think is dead alive too.
5126.92,5130.5199999999995, Or one person didn't know anything about it but someone else taught them how to counter.
5130.5199999999995,5133.48, So they were just doing counter back in the back in counter and there were different
5133.48,5134.48, of the director.
5134.48,5135.48, They were a dead ero.
5135.48,5136.96, Like dead ero like winning every time.
5136.96,5143.2, That's why I was like garden packs more because the counters like guaranteed damage on it.
5143.2,5145.96, So it's like well why not just sit there and try counter.
5146.04,5149.52, That's the first and all that's all that they knew about the game was how to counter because
5149.52,5151.72, that's all that they were taught by the other person and they'd win.
5151.72,5154.88, They want constantly because you just be spamming counters.
5154.88,5155.96, It's a knowing shit.
5155.96,5156.96, Yeah.
5156.96,5162.8," So, oh wait I guess Anthony did you have more of anticipated games or we got way off."
5162.8,5165.08," No, Starcraft's here one and follow."
5165.08,5166.08, You have to pick a new one.
5166.08,5167.72, To pick a new one.
5167.72,5169.92," Yeah, what definitely was Starcraft."
5169.92,5175.12, That's going to say I had a great memory so playing battle at the beginning.
5175.12,5178.32, Because it was kind of the good old days if you were in on it from the beginning when
5178.32,5180.2, it wasn't all pro yet.
5180.2,5182.599999999999, You actually could just do a random battle net.
5182.599999999999,5183.599999999999, I mean that's all I would do.
5183.599999999999,5187.2, I'll just go into the lobby and just say I want to be in a two on two or four or
5187.2,5189.36, whatever and I could play and keep up.
5189.36,5194.0, I wouldn't be great and I'd fact that usually lives because even then people are just.
5194.0,5199.12," Well, in the early in the early days of, you know, any RTS's lifespan, it's kind of"
5199.12,5200.12, still the learning phase.
5200.12,5204.4," And if you get in there, some games are just like teaching each other in some ways."
5204.4,5206.44," Yeah, I've had battles go like that."
5206.44,5208.44, And now I wouldn't dream of going on battle net.
5208.44,5211.04," That would be like, I like, I like up."
5211.04,5212.04, I like up.
5212.04,5213.679999999999," You know, you're playing a say like a four V4."
5213.679999999999,5214.679999999999, Yeah.
5214.679999999999,5217.44," And in that game, you're able to like just basically call a truce with someone."
5217.44,5220.719999999999, And there are people that are stat hores and they just never want to lose.
5220.719999999999,5223.48, So then you have to start begging you to ally up.
5223.48,5224.48, Yeah.
5224.48,5226.96, So I guess you weren't saying that you know what you do.
5226.96,5227.96, So no.
5227.96,5230.599999999999, He doesn't make friends.
5230.599999999999,5233.639999999999, I don't talk to people.
5233.64,5237.84," So other than that, when am I looking forward to, well, I'm definitely looking forward"
5237.84,5242.360000000001," to another RTS would be, and I guess it's probably not officially announced."
5242.360000000001,5246.320000000001," And it, and I don't even know for sure whether it's actually happening for real, but I assume"
5246.320000000001,5248.04, there's going to be another dawn of war.
5248.04,5252.64," Oh, from relics, other franchise, which I've always been very into."
5252.64,5257.6, So some looking forward to that.
5257.6,5266.04," And the other big one, fault three other than that, would probably be buyers next game,"
5266.04,5268.64, which we have heard nothing about on the PC.
5268.64,5272.84," Yeah, Dragon Age since way back when we first wrote about it over a year ago."
5272.84,5274.240000000001, Yeah.
5274.240000000001,5275.64, I want them.
5275.64,5276.64, I love borrow games.
5276.64,5279.92, And I hope they learn from Mass Effect.
5279.92,5285.76," Yeah, I have to say I've not, you know, I didn't play Mass Effect long enough to decide"
5285.76,5287.2, if it didn't grab me.
5287.2,5290.2, So I let it go very early into my experience there.
5290.2,5291.2, It's coming to PC.
5291.2,5292.2, I'm going to try it.
5292.2,5296.4400000000005," I'll try it again, but I wish it's one of those games I wish I had waited because it's"
5296.4400000000005,5300.2, not a huge difference between the console one and the PC one.
5300.2,5302.2, But there's enough little tweaks that may be okay.
5302.2,5306.280000000001, That would have been better if I just held out a little longer since you're probably
5306.280000000001,5307.280000000001, going to review it.
5307.280000000001,5308.52, You probably wish you waited too.
5308.52,5312.88," Well, you know, I actually have been half meaning to play it again, but then like I"
5312.88,5314.56," started and like wait, why don't I want to play this again?"
5314.56,5316.8, Something about it is bringing me back.
5316.8,5320.28," So I'm just going to wait for the PC one because I want to play through, you know, being"
5320.28,5321.8, the good guy.
5321.8,5322.8, Yeah.
5322.8,5325.92, There's tons of other games too that we're not remembering.
5325.92,5327.88," Oh, don't be that bad for not just that."
5327.88,5330.64," You know, we have chance to talk about one right."
5330.64,5335.2, So I'm actually pretty interested in Far Cry 2.
5335.2,5336.2, Yeah.
5336.2,5337.2, It looks pretty cool to me.
5337.2,5338.2, Really good.
5338.2,5342.84," Now, just announced the alien's game and like the ringer box to be on 12."
5342.84,5346.2," Years old and you know, the first there's an arm cell highway, too."
5346.2,5348.08, I want to play that board of land.
5348.08,5350.68, Everything the gearbox is going to be so far from gearbox.
5350.68,5351.68, Yep.
5351.68,5352.68, Got my interest.
5352.68,5353.68, Yep.
5353.68,5358.64," And whatever Ken Levine has up its sleeve next, which we have a pretty decent idea about,"
5358.64,5359.64, but we can't say.
5359.64,5361.96, And it will be total speculation anyway.
5361.96,5362.96, Yeah.
5362.96,5367.72," But it will make, if it's what we think it is, it'll make people pretty damn happy."
5367.72,5372.4400000000005, You could probably Google or Wikipedia didn't get some good clues because that's about
5372.5199999999995,5373.44, all we have to.
5373.44,5376.0," But if it is what we think, then we're all happy."
5376.0,5378.0, The working on a fire shock sauce.
5378.0,5379.32, That's that for a big help.
5379.32,5383.36," Which will be interesting to see what comes to that of what, sorry, on a bio-shock"
5383.36,5384.36, sequel.
5384.36,5386.24," It's all, it's a we know if that's called geoshock."
5386.24,5388.879999999999, It's actually set in the the bowels of the earth.
5388.879999999999,5391.759999999999, And then they have a plan is a trilogy in arrow shocks to third one.
5391.759999999999,5394.0, And there's basically like best been cloud city.
5394.0,5395.0, Cool.
5395.0,5396.32," You're totally, but it's not totally bullshit."
5396.32,5397.32, I know you're.
5397.32,5398.32, Geoshock.
5398.32,5399.32, Geoshock.
5399.32,5400.32, It's all the concept.
5400.32,5401.32, Son of a bitch.
5401.32,5402.32, Yeah.
5402.32,5403.32, You got it.
5403.32,5404.32, You got it.
5404.32,5405.32," For you like, I've been waiting for the air."
5405.32,5408.32," The more serious Sean Lacks, the more he's bullshitting."
5408.32,5409.32, I know.
5409.32,5410.32, If I remember just like straight face.
5410.32,5412.639999999999," Well, it was like one time in a company here as a child."
5412.639999999999,5416.92," We were playing a map and Sean was like, oh shit, this shitty map where you got to use"
5416.92,5418.679999999999, boats across the river.
5418.679999999999,5419.92," And I was like, oh shit."
5419.92,5421.32," All right, first thing I got to do."
5421.32,5422.32, I'm off to the boat.
5422.32,5423.32, There's no boat.
5423.32,5424.32, There's no boat.
5424.32,5425.32, You know what?
5425.32,5426.32, You're right.
5426.32,5427.32, You were.
5427.32,5428.32, It's so fresh.
5428.32,5429.32, I didn't see you.
5429.32,5432.32, I think you're I look like what are you doing over there.
5432.32,5435.32, Trying to get the boat.
5435.32,5437.32, And half of episode three.
5437.32,5438.32, Oh yeah.
5438.32,5439.32, Thank you.
5439.32,5440.32, Cliff anger there.
5440.32,5441.32, Poor little follow up.
5441.32,5442.32, Yeah.
5442.32,5444.32, They're talking about counter strike two.
5444.32,5445.32, Hmm.
5445.32,5446.32, Which will be interesting.
5446.32,5448.32, It's never got into counter strike.
5448.32,5453.32," I think they're still in the either Doug and Barney and Val is, you know,"
5453.32,5457.32," Marking director there is just kind of like teasing people, showing the world that, yes."
5457.32,5460.32, CS source is not the end of the CS series.
5460.32,5464.32," But saying that like, yeah, it'll be different."
5464.32,5468.32, It's not worth seeing source was basically just counter strike with a new engine.
5468.32,5469.32, Resconding.
5469.32,5471.32," And of course, tournament players don't shoot me."
5471.32,5474.32, I know how much bullets bread and all that's affecting you.
5474.32,5476.32, And you think it's an entirely different game.
5476.32,5480.32," But for the rest of us that don't play tournament level, it's basically the same game with like"
5480.32,5481.32, Freedom tires.
5481.32,5484.32," Freedom tires, the tire that rules down the street."
5484.32,5487.32, It's just a state of staying in the same place in the matter.
5487.32,5489.32," But yeah, it sounds like they're, they're, they're,"
5489.32,5491.32, want to do something with it.
5491.32,5495.32," They're considering, you know, should they do like a TF2 style thing, not visually,"
5495.32,5502.32," but for the extent to which team boarders to differs in gameplay from team boarders classic, you know."
5502.32,5504.32, So that'll be interesting.
5504.32,5511.32," I hope they do change it though, because like you say, I don't play counter strike because it's so, it's so specific."
5511.32,5513.32," It's just so counter strike, you know."
5513.32,5517.32," That was another game that I got in, like people tried to get me into a two-late."
5517.32,5518.32, Yeah.
5518.32,5520.32, You get shot and you die and hit the end.
5520.32,5521.32, Right.
5521.32,5524.32, And that is the most off-putting thing for someone who's just jumping in.
5524.32,5525.32, Yeah.
5525.32,5526.32, It's no game to learn in.
5526.32,5527.32, Yeah.
5527.32,5528.32, Yeah.
5528.32,5529.32, It's infuriating to go in.
5529.32,5533.32," But conversely, you feel great when you start getting, when you get to the point where you start getting kills in the game."
5533.32,5534.32, Yeah.
5534.32,5535.32," Because you're like, holy shit, I got a kill."
5535.32,5536.32, Yeah.
5536.32,5538.32, Then you get the last 20 seconds.
5538.32,5541.32," But then it's always still like even when, you know,"
5541.32,5542.32, you get decent.
5542.32,5544.32," It's kind of like, it's just so specific."
5544.32,5545.32, The maps are so small.
5545.32,5548.32, It plays out in like a set number of ways.
5548.32,5552.32," People are always going to be in the same spots and it's going to be like, are they a better shot than you and answers?"
5552.32,5554.32," Always someone is, you know."
5554.32,5558.32," So, and then you got to wait and watch the people that are better than you."
5558.32,5562.32, Proved to you how much better than you they are for the rest of the rest of the round.
5562.32,5563.32, It's pretty rad.
5563.32,5564.32, Yeah.
5564.32,5565.32, That's all they got.
5565.32,5568.32," But if they're good, they'll give you some spray tanks that are entertaining."
5568.32,5573.32, We've been countered meetspin in our last encounter in Team Fortress 2.
5573.32,5574.32, Meetspin?
5574.32,5575.32, Meetspin?
5575.32,5576.32, I don't know what is that.
5576.32,5578.32," It's basically like, kind of no."
5578.32,5579.32, No.
5579.32,5585.32," It's like, it's like, it's two guys having sex, but it's just a close-up of the janitailia."
5585.32,5589.32," And the meat is like spinning around, like wagging around."
5589.32,5590.32," Wait, this is a tag."
5590.32,5591.32, A tag?
5591.32,5592.32, This is a tag.
5592.32,5594.32, But he's got like a mini line like a tag.
5594.32,5595.32," Yeah, it's a good tag."
5595.32,5596.32, Okay.
5596.32,5597.32, So you're going to have animated gift tags?
5597.32,5598.32," Oh, yeah."
5598.32,5599.32," Oh, you're getting asked?"
5599.32,5600.32," Oh, I didn't know."
5600.32,5603.32," There's like, there's all kinds of like, scat stuff going on."
5603.32,5606.32," I mean, the funny thing was, you just put it in and put it on the wall."
5606.32,5608.32, And it's there for an entire time.
5608.32,5609.32, For half hour it was in this one.
5609.32,5612.32," But yeah, but the funny thing was, is that like everyone was like,"
5612.32,5613.32," Oh, my God."
5613.32,5614.32, Why is this here?
5614.32,5615.32," And Sean was like, I want to see."
5615.32,5616.32, I want to see.
5616.32,5617.32, It was on the other team.
5617.32,5618.32," Oh, wow."
5618.32,5620.32," He would kill everyone and be like, I got through seconds."
5620.32,5621.32, I got through seconds.
5621.32,5622.32, I tried running.
5622.32,5623.32, I saw it.
5623.32,5625.32, I don't know.
5626.32,5628.32, I didn't know you could do animated gift.
5628.32,5629.32, So let's just do it.
5629.32,5630.32, Can you do that?
5630.32,5631.32, You can do it.
5631.32,5635.32, And all the games you could do counter strike and do it in team four.
5635.32,5636.32," Yeah, wow."
5636.32,5637.32, And all the valve games.
5637.32,5638.32, Okay.
5638.32,5639.32, So it can lead that.
5639.32,5640.32, That basically no one.
5640.32,5642.32, Online content subject to subject to change.
5642.32,5643.32, But they have that.
5643.32,5644.32, You're ready.
5644.32,5645.32, It can go.
5645.32,5646.32, He has to also go.
5646.32,5647.32, Yes.
5647.32,5648.32, I'm talking about.
5648.32,5649.32, Tell me.
5649.32,5650.32, You're talking about counter strike.
5650.32,5651.32, They sprayed it in their spawn.
5651.32,5653.32, And you don't have to end when you get to go into their spawn.
5653.32,5654.32, I didn't have to go into their spawn.
5654.32,5657.32," So I went in there to kill him and I was like, oh, what if we got here?"
5657.32,5660.32," So I was like, tell my team."
5660.32,5661.32, I didn't tell him what it was.
5661.32,5662.32," I'm like, do get in there."
5662.32,5663.32, They're some good shit in there.
5663.32,5666.32," But I was like, I ain't fucking go back in there."
5666.32,5667.32, So they went.
5667.32,5671.32," But of course, Rory, who's like the internet sage."
5671.32,5674.32," Basically every, you know, like the person in this office."
5674.32,5675.32, I'm kind of that way.
5675.32,5676.32," Like someone sends me a link and I'm like, old."
5676.32,5677.32, Yeah.
5677.32,5678.32, Is that way about doing that?
5678.32,5679.32, Everything.
5679.32,5680.32," I call him, you know, Batman."
5680.32,5681.32, There's the character Oracle.
5681.32,5682.32," And she's like,"
5682.32,5686.32," knows like, she's who Batman goes to when she, when he needs like any information."
5686.32,5687.32, Yeah.
5687.32,5688.32, Though anything she's already been there.
5688.32,5689.32, Right.
5689.32,5690.32," This was like, how scooter used to be here."
5690.32,5691.32, Yeah.
5691.32,5693.32," So he'll be like, dude, that shit fucking sold."
5693.32,5695.32, He knows that that's why I knew what it was called.
5695.32,5697.32," I was like, oh, that's what it was because I,"
5697.32,5700.32," Well, when you described her, like, I was like, oh, yeah, I've seen that."
5700.32,5701.32, Yeah.
5701.32,5705.32," I heard of like the name, but I knew it was something I never wanted to click on."
5705.32,5708.32," You know, like when people would bring it up, I'll be like, okay, just watch for that."
5708.32,5710.32, Never go to do it.
5710.32,5714.32, You need to click on any link anyone ever sends you for the shit you've sent everyone.
5714.32,5715.32, No kidding.
5715.32,5716.32, No kidding.
5716.32,5718.32, Your carmen needs to catch up with you.
5718.32,5719.32, Yeah.
5719.32,5720.32, Yeah.
5720.32,5721.32, Yeah. I've been hooking.
5721.32,5722.32, I can go to something this week alone.
5722.32,5724.32," We had, uh, there's the one."
5724.32,5730.32," That's already old, but the guy who wraps his unit in tin foil sticks to tip and do a light socket."
5730.32,5731.32, What?
5731.32,5732.32, I said you that this morning.
5732.32,5736.32," See, I don't click on every link of yours anymore because of, I'm worried."
5736.32,5738.32, Don't get hurt.
5738.32,5739.32, The other one.
5739.32,5740.32," If you're like, scare me."
5740.32,5741.32, That was old because you're not hitting.
5741.32,5743.32, So that's why you're getting it.
5743.32,5744.32, Okay.
5744.32,5747.32," But the other one, I sent you, you did watch about the, the Zoolffers."
5747.32,5749.32," Yeah, I did watch it, see?"
5749.32,5750.32, You sent me a link.
5750.32,5751.32, I didn't know what it's about.
5751.32,5757.32," I click on it and then sure enough, it's two people talking about having sex with animals."
5757.32,5759.32, And then Sean wonders why I don't click on it.
5759.32,5761.32, But then I kicked you a freestyle about it though.
5761.32,5762.32, Yeah.
5762.32,5763.32, You did.
5763.32,5764.32, And that was funny.
5764.32,5766.32, That's what it's all about.
5766.32,5767.32, Yeah.
5767.32,5769.32, How we doing on time and so are we done?
5769.32,5770.32, We should be done.
5770.32,5776.32," We just went on to get a random set of, um, having told stories from my past."
5776.32,5777.32, Yeah.
5777.32,5778.32, I got some random ones.
5778.32,5779.32, All right.
5779.32,5780.32, Yeah.
5780.32,5781.32, That's just to be the last one.
5781.32,5782.32, I just figured somehow it's never come up.
5782.32,5788.32," I've talked about like, Corey and all these other figures in my history who played games with and everything."
5788.32,5792.32," And somehow Alvin Walter Broils, the third hasn't come up."
5792.32,5795.32, And that name should make you smile.
5796.32,5798.32," It's a good name because, um,"
5798.32,5800.32," Basically, I need this kid all growing up."
5800.32,5804.32, So for elementary school on and he was always like a total punk.
5804.32,5808.32," He was he was like, be like, alphabetally in our group."
5808.32,5811.32," And he was, he was the kind of kid, like, if you're walking by a puddle, you could be like best friends."
5811.32,5813.32, Maybe there's like four of you or something.
5813.32,5816.32," He'll just stop in it, like in your direction to soak you in the shit."
5816.32,5820.32," Or like, and then he'll apologize, but come on, calm."
5820.32,5821.32, Sorry.
5821.32,5823.32, And then there'll be like a big plant like they call a bushwilly.
5823.32,5828.32," Like basically in Southern California, like a big stock and it's loaded with just like furry crap that like this was like come off."
5828.32,5834.32," Yeah, then he was like grab one of those and they're like six feet long and then like feather you with that after he'd already like,"
5834.32,5836.32, Or let's tardy with the mud puddle.
5836.32,5839.32," So, or like a cat or there'll be a rotten cactus apple."
5839.32,5845.32," I mean, there's a time when if you saw anything rotten on the street or anything, you would run immediately before he saw it."
5845.32,5849.32," Because there's like time even that, you know, in school, I remember."
5849.32,5855.32," He even did to me, I was eating like this burrito. I mean, we had burritos for school lunch and it had like a hot dog in it."
5855.32,5857.32, And what in the burrito?
5857.32,5860.32," Yeah, it had a hot dog and that was a nasty surprise for everyone."
5860.32,5862.32, So it would be like beans and there's just a hot dog in it.
5862.32,5866.32," And then he just like, look, said it takes a bite and then throws it right on my fucking shirt."
5866.32,5869.32, What the fuck was that?
5869.32,5871.32, So we were always getting fights and shit.
5871.32,5877.32," I mean, our whole youth was, you know, us like wanting to fucking beat each other up and he was always a little bigger though."
5877.32,5880.32," I would get, I would lose most of the time."
5880.32,5889.32," But so I grew up with him and high school was crazy because then he started, he was like the first one in our group, you know, start trying drugs and everything."
5889.32,5894.32, And so he would just start coming to class in the home room and high school. He would drop acid or shit.
5894.32,5899.32," And then here's the things with him. Like he, we had like a school assembly one time."
5899.32,5904.32," You know, everyone goes into the gym and you're in the bleachers and there's an assembly and they started playing like some Nirvana."
5905.32,5915.32," And he, he was on acid that day and he's wearing like Doc Martins and shit and he's up in the bleachers and he just starts rolling over everyone's head like he said in Nirvana concert."
5915.32,5922.32," Right, but you got to imagine it's all these like high school girls and shit, you know, they're just chilling and like, what's going on?"
5922.32,5924.32, Like all of a sudden like just boots and this fool.
5924.32,5929.32, It's just like elbows and knuckles rolling over everyone's head like he's like at the Nirvana concert.
5929.32,5931.32, I'm not making this up at all.
5932.32,5941.32," Now he's a CEO somewhere. No, I'll get to like his story. I do do a quick chronology. So then later that same year he was in the high school air band thing."
5941.32,5949.32," And this was the big year, like in addition to the town show, they'd have an air band thing. And it's basically you put up your whatever your choreograph stage presence."
5949.32,5952.32," You lip sync to a song, but you have like the full. It's basically guitar here."
5952.32,5955.32, Sure. You all get up there and pretend that you actually know how to play.
5955.32,5963.32," So he somehow got through the screening, um, napa, napa, I'm deaf song. And that's like this like obnoxious death metal."
5963.32,5969.32," And he brought like, so it's all most of it's what you would expect in a high school air band."
5969.32,5976.32," It's a bunch of girls and like, in, you know, like all the whatever civic courses and stuff that are doing yellow submarine and they got a big cardboard yellow submarine."
5976.32,5980.32, They're all cutely dancing behind and stuff. So he comes up there with that.
5980.32,5985.32," And it's like the PTA, you know, like parents are in the judges table and the front and stuff. And it starts playing."
5985.32,5994.32," And then a bunch of us started like washing, but it was all like chairs, you know, foldable chairs. And then that started going bad because like the coaches and shit at that time that we're kind of hanging out there."
5994.32,5998.32, They didn't know what the fuck we were doing. They thought we were just starting a riot or something.
5998.32,6001.32, So they came in and just started grabbing us by the scruffs of our neck.
6001.32,6006.32," But before that happened before I like I got grabbing some other people else with, we see Alvin."
6006.32,6010.32, He's spinning fake blood all over the stage. He wasn't supposed to do that.
6010.32,6014.32, But then he opens his like his jacket and he's got like a beef kidney. He got from a safe way.
6014.32,6018.32, And he throws it smack right at the fucking PTA judges.
6018.32,6023.32," They're like, they don't get it's cool. And he's banging his head and shit pretending he's playing. They can't tell."
6023.32,6026.32," Like, you know, like that kind of bullshit."
6026.32,6028.32, They throw it that at them.
6028.32,6032.32, So the same guy ended up becoming a massive methadic.
6032.32,6035.32," And then we couldn't tell. Like we got to this point where we were all like,"
6035.32,6037.32, And he dropped out of high school of course.
6037.32,6040.32," And like, we still, we start drifting away and you see him."
6040.32,6046.32, More often than not out front of the local liquor store where he's trying to fish for alcohol or something.
6046.32,6051.32," And then, but we'd still kind of insist like he'd want to come over and hang out."
6051.32,6054.32," And we were like, he's just crazy. And I didn't know what at the time."
6054.32,6057.32," I was like, this meth really, that fucked up."
6057.32,6061.32," And then I had like a bunch of other friends and my, my half brother that we're like,"
6061.32,6064.32," meth junkies. And then I was exposed to it more and I was like,"
6064.32,6068.32," There's something else here. And I figured out, ultimately, he clearly had to have been schizophrenic."
6068.32,6070.32," And it was just at that time, right?"
6070.32,6073.32," You know, laid out a lesson like early adulthood."
6073.32,6076.32, And he had that. And a lot of times people that our scripts get to
6076.32,6080.32, Frank and up doing a bunch of drugs like around that time too before hand.
6080.32,6082.32," And it's kind of like confusing for, you know,"
6082.32,6085.32, for family and stuff to sort out what it was.
6085.32,6087.32, Did the drugs make them go crazy?
6087.32,6091.32," Now it's just classic. Now that I know like I've had, you know, like an edex girlfriend,"
6091.32,6093.32," his brother or skits. So I told you, Corey's brother and it up,"
6093.32,6097.32," he got me skits. So, but so, at the time when I still didn't know this,"
6097.32,6099.32, we would try to hang out with them now on that.
6099.32,6100.32, And he'd go on to these runs with them.
6100.32,6102.32," Well, let's just go to a friend's house."
6102.32,6104.32, Now is about the most coherent thing you'd say.
6104.32,6108.32," It's half time. He'd try to tell you how like he, he learned in the jutsu."
6108.32,6110.32," And you're like, well, what did you, what do you mean?"
6110.32,6114.32, And he's telling the story. And it's one of those like dream-like senses of logic
6114.32,6115.32, that makes no sense whatsoever.
6115.32,6119.32," And you ultimately figure out that he's saying that he became so good at guitar,"
6119.32,6121.32," playing guitar, he also learned in jutsu."
6121.32,6124.32," He was like one of those kind of, so yeah, we go to this house."
6124.32,6126.32, Okay. And he wanted to hang out with this guy.
6126.32,6129.32," Because I told you, it was kind of, it's one of those things."
6129.32,6132.32," You know, say you're like, whatever, your 19 or 20 or something."
6132.32,6135.32, And you'd spent your whole life in knowing this person.
6135.32,6136.32, Yep.
6136.32,6137.32, Yeah.
6137.32,6139.32," I think you can see the point where you're like, I hate getting hang out with you anymore."
6139.32,6141.32, This is what I'm telling you about the last episodes.
6141.32,6142.32, So we go to this house.
6142.32,6145.32," It's a total fucking shit hole, like a total druggy house."
6145.32,6147.32," You know, like you don't even know how they're paying rent."
6147.32,6150.32, It's like broken windows and crap. There's no furniture or anything.
6150.32,6152.32, And there's just a shitty TV there.
6152.32,6155.32," And we're all just sitting around. I'm like, dude, we trying to tell him like,"
6155.32,6159.32, waiting for the other guy that live there to go into the bathroom or something.
6159.32,6160.32," Like, that's fucking go, you know."
6160.32,6162.32, But you were sitting there.
6162.32,6164.32, And as a guy's just talking about how much he loves this TV.
6164.32,6168.32," And I'll even tell him, man, we gotta go and take this TV and pawn it."
6168.32,6171.32, Because he wanted to take it and pawn it to get money for some more meth.
6171.32,6174.32," You know, we wanted to get another eight ball. And then because I said, I love this TV."
6174.32,6179.32," Man, I love this. And I can understand why I was the only thing in his entire house other than the shitty couch."
6179.32,6182.32," All of a sudden, Alvin picks up the phone."
6182.32,6185.32, It hit him. He hadn't wronged or anything. He picks up the phone.
6185.32,6188.32," And then he looked as face goes just like,"
6188.32,6189.32, he looks as though expression.
6189.32,6191.32," And he looks at us and he's like, oh shit."
6191.32,6192.32, We got to run.
6192.32,6193.32, And then he hangs it up.
6193.32,6194.32, And we're all running.
6194.32,6197.32," Next thing I know, we're all just fucking hauling us out this house."
6197.32,6198.32, And we get like two blocks.
6198.32,6201.32," And at that point, as I was running, I was like, okay, I think I figured it out."
6201.32,6204.32, But we shouldn't still be running according to the way I figured it out.
6204.32,6206.32, And that would be he wanted us to all.
6206.32,6209.32, He wanted to try to get the kid out of the house so he can go back and take the TV.
6209.32,6211.32, So then he can go pawn that.
6211.32,6215.32," So then I ask him, that I'm like, are you going to get the TV or what are you doing?"
6215.32,6217.32," And he's like, what are you talking about?"
6217.32,6220.32, And by the time we just kind of slowed into a just a walk from the run.
6220.32,6223.32, And then he didn't have any explanation or anything.
6223.32,6225.32, That was just it.
6225.32,6227.32, So that's an anthropometric end of the story.
6227.32,6229.32, You don't know why you were running.
6229.32,6230.32, There was just no idea.
6230.32,6232.32, It's just that it's sometimes.
6232.32,6233.32, That just happened.
6233.32,6234.32, Wow.
6234.32,6235.32, Yeah.
6235.32,6236.32, This is like a Tarantino movie of the sun.
6236.32,6237.32, It's good for it.
6237.32,6238.32, Yeah.
6238.32,6240.32, But the last time you ever saw it.
6240.32,6241.32," No, we would see him."
6241.32,6242.32, They're always stories about him.
6242.32,6244.32, So we would see him at this beach or that beach.
6244.32,6248.32, Or he was on like the local news because they were doing a story about that same liquor store out.
6248.32,6249.32, Would sell the miners and shit.
6249.32,6251.32, He was on there like yelling at the camera.
6251.32,6253.32, This doesn't shane is it.
6253.32,6256.32, You want you to tell a shane story?
6256.32,6258.32, I don't know how many shane stars.
6258.32,6260.32, What is it?
6260.32,6261.32, I don't have any.
6261.32,6262.32, All right.
6262.32,6264.32, I don't know if we should tell what we got.
6264.32,6268.32, I got we all got word of a particularly incriminating one today.
6268.32,6269.32," Oh, that one."
6269.32,6271.32, That's not our place.
6271.32,6272.32, All right.
6272.32,6273.32, Okay.
6273.32,6274.32, That's not that.
6274.32,6275.32, That's not everybody wondering.
6275.32,6276.32, Yeah.
6276.32,6279.32, I am going to end the rumor though that I'm Shane's father though.
6279.32,6280.32, That Shane started.
6280.32,6281.32, Is there a rumor?
6281.32,6282.32, Yeah.
