0.0,7.6000000000000005, Hello and welcome once again to everybody's favorite half hour of the week.
7.6000000000000005,9.6," Yes, it's the CGW podcast."
9.6,17.44," This is Jeff Green, the editor-in-chief of CGW and with me today as usual are the following."
17.44,22.88," Brian Scott, Roko, Sean Elliott, and Darynglatsom, and Scott Osmol."
22.88,23.88, Hi guys.
23.88,27.32," Hi, hi Jeff."
27.32,34.04," First of all, let me just say that this next half hour is going to be a wee free zone."
34.04,38.6, I think every single person's podcast this week has been about the wee.
38.6,40.6, And I'll do we need to chime in on that.
40.6,43.44," Now that I said it, the puns on it, they got to stop the jump."
43.44,44.44, The jump trains over.
44.44,45.760000000000005, We have much better stuff to talk about.
45.760000000000005,48.04, So we're not going to wee here.
48.04,50.44," Actually, I just did it."
50.44,51.760000000000005, Free start this thing.
51.760000000000005,52.760000000000005," God, no."
52.760000000000005,53.760000000000005, Okay.
53.760000000000005,54.760000000000005, We'll move on.
54.760000000000005,56.44, No wee from the CGW editors.
56.519999999999996,62.519999999999996, What we will talk about is this was actually a good week for some PC game releases.
62.519999999999996,67.12, So we've been happy little gamers playing our games.
67.12,72.0," Let's see, we had Guild Wars factions went live officially."
72.0,77.4," I've been playing a lot of Heroes 5, which is not out yet, but I did get the goldmaster"
77.4,78.4, because I'm special.
78.4,80.44, So I've been playing a lot of that.
80.44,84.08, We had Ottawa Salt from NCSoft.
84.16,86.44," Yeah, then they came out, was it a couple weeks ago?"
86.44,89.16," A couple weeks ago, right."
89.16,92.16, And what we just talking about paradise?
92.16,96.75999999999999," Paradise, right, from the guy who made Siberia, which none of us have started to get,"
96.75999999999999,98.75999999999999, but we're excited about some of us.
98.75999999999999,104.75999999999999, And we also just got into the Gold Masters for Ghost Recon Advance Warfighter PC and
104.75999999999999,106.84, an IGF at a couple of IGF physics cards.
106.84,111.72," And to top it off, Hidden Beta 3 came out, which is a source mod that's really cool."
111.8,114.08, We've talked about it before in the show and the latest version came out.
114.08,114.92, That's really nice.
114.92,118.56," Right. So all of a sudden, lots, lots of games to play."
118.56,120.68, And no time to play them.
120.68,125.44, Ryan has been knee deep in factions.
125.44,128.28, And he's been yamoring kind of incoherently about it ever since.
128.28,131.44," So Ryan, you told us you had a rant."
131.44,136.28, You wanted to unleash about factions.
136.28,138.32, Since you rarely rant.
138.32,140.48, We're giving you the chance now.
140.56,141.32, We want to rant.
141.32,142.16, Yeah.
142.16,148.64," All right. Well, the big thing about factions is the two new classes that the game introduces."
148.64,154.35999999999999," There's the assassin, which is sort of like a rogue type character."
154.35999999999999,155.39999999999998, He was our IGN cover.
155.39999999999998,156.23999999999998," Faber, right?"
156.23999999999998,156.39999999999998, Yeah.
156.39999999999998,157.07999999999998," Yes, assassin."
157.07999999999998,158.23999999999998, He was.
158.23999999999998,159.23999999999998, Right.
159.23999999999998,160.67999999999998, All right.
160.67999999999998,162.51999999999998," And those guys, they do a lot of damage."
162.51999999999998,164.72, They have no armor.
164.72,168.88," And in the ritual, it's just kind of like this weird hybrid spellcaster type of character."
168.88,170.56," Kind of a summoner thing, right?"
170.56,171.56, Yeah.
171.56,174.51999999999998, Sort of like a healer summoner.
174.51999999999998,177.2," Is it kind of like a hybrid of like basically, you know, the, it's like a monk,"
177.2,179.79999999999998," necromancer, ranger, sort of jack of all trades."
179.79999999999998,180.79999999999998, Okay.
180.79999999999998,182.24, We're a little weak in twist.
182.24,186.64, What's the weird thing on its head?
186.64,190.92," It's got like, you know, it's like a scarf, but it's like around its eyes."
190.92,191.92, Right.
191.92,194.44," Well, there's supposed to like be seeing into the spirit world or something."
194.44,195.44, Yeah.
195.44,196.68, It's like a voldo or something.
196.68,197.68, Yeah.
198.20000000000002,201.92000000000002, So who are you playing as or what are you playing?
201.92000000000002,204.36, I'm playing as an assassin.
204.36,206.32, That's my new character.
206.32,208.0, And so is everyone else.
208.0,209.16, Aha.
209.16,210.8, Which is the problem.
210.8,212.8, You'll get into groups.
212.8,216.76000000000002," You know, eight man group is routinely going to have like five assassins."
216.76000000000002,218.76000000000002, And like the rest of them will be ritualized.
218.76000000000002,219.76000000000002, Which is what it's just about.
219.76000000000002,221.96, What do you expect out of an expansion?
221.96,224.36," I mean, everybody wants to try the new."
224.36,227.64000000000001," Yeah, but you don't actually get anything done that way."
227.64,234.92, And a lot of the people who play assassins aren't really playing them correctly.
234.92,235.92, Correct.
235.92,236.92, Correct.
236.92,238.2," According to you, people assassins are not warriors."
238.2,243.07999999999998, I'm sure a lot of the people on the Guild Wars message board will agree with me.
243.07999999999998,244.07999999999998, Assassins are not warriors.
244.07999999999998,248.83999999999997," A sat people tend to play them, you know, brush straight into combat, first man in,"
248.83999999999997,253.32," and also first man to die because, you know, assassins aren't supposed to be tanks."
253.32,255.95999999999998, So they're supposed to what your supposed to stealthy your way through.
256.28000000000003,257.56, They're kind of like hitting run.
257.56,260.72, They've got a lot of that kind of teleport spells.
260.72,261.28000000000003, Mm-hmm.
261.28000000000003,263.0, To help them get in and out of danger.
263.0,265.64, Which people don't seem to use very often.
265.64,267.16, So are you complaining about the game?
267.16,268.8, Or are you complaining about the people playing the game?
268.8,270.28000000000003, I'm complaining about the people.
270.28000000000003,272.92," Like how it makes the game, though, does that mean if you're playing the game with a bunch of"
272.92,275.48," shows, you've got to totally ruin the experience?"
275.48,280.92," Well, I'm hoping that the excitement for the new classes kind of dies down after a couple"
280.92,282.92," months, you know, and people."
282.92,284.28000000000003, And we're just on.
284.35999999999996,287.64," We're just telling me yesterday that, you know, because I was playing the original Guild Wars,"
287.64,288.64, and I didn't get it.
288.64,291.76, Never got a chance to finish the original campaign.
291.76,294.84," I could just not even bother with that and just start with this new,"
294.84,297.32, start with a fresh character in the new.
297.32,298.32, You could.
298.32,299.32, Yeah.
299.32,301.32," I mean, it's like, you don't even have to own the original game to play this."
301.32,302.32, It's a whole new.
302.32,303.32, Right.
303.32,304.32, Right.
304.32,307.03999999999996," And you can create any of the character classes in the new one, right?"
307.03999999999996,308.03999999999996, Right.
308.03999999999996,309.32, Not just assassins and ritualists.
309.32,310.32, Right.
310.32,314.23999999999995," So Monk is going to be in demand again, like always in every one of these games."
314.88,317.2," The Monk that you know, that's one of the surprising things."
317.2,320.32, It was like a lot of the groups that I've been in on the story mission.
320.32,325.72," There have been no, there's been a real shortage of healers, which is very weird for a game like this."
325.72,330.56," Well, what happens when you, because you stole the secondary thing, one of the distinguishing aspects of Guild Wars is that,"
330.56,332.56," you know, you can have a secondary spin in the hands per T."
332.56,338.40000000000003," So what if you, you know, a warrior with an assassin as your secondary specialty,"
338.40000000000003,340.28000000000003, you see anything like that?
340.32,345.23999999999995," A lot of the assassin characters I've seen have been like primary assassin, you know,"
345.23999999999995,346.23999999999995, something like that.
346.23999999999995,348.79999999999995, Could you do it like a primary assassin in secondary?
348.79999999999995,352.55999999999995, Why are you or something with that fix a problem of the tank issue or no?
352.55999999999995,359.35999999999996," Well, the problem with with assassins, whatever your primary class is, that's like the armor that you"
359.35999999999996,361.96, stuck with and they have very low armor.
361.96,362.96, Right.
362.96,364.15999999999997," So, right."
364.15999999999997,369.47999999999996," So yeah, I mean, you're right, probably after a little while, the novelty will die down and people will"
369.56,372.24," be in need for all the other character classes again, right?"
372.24,373.24, Right.
373.24,375.92, Sounds like a good game to start fresh in any way.
375.92,376.92, Right.
376.92,379.84000000000003," You're talking about how you can level up in six hours, get up to 18 or something."
379.84000000000003,380.84000000000003," Well, the good thing, yeah."
380.84000000000003,385.96000000000004," I mean, like the pacing of this game is hands down better than the original game."
385.96000000000004,390.48," There's really, unless you're like attached to the face graphics from the first game,"
390.48,394.48," there's really no reason to start a character, a new character in that game anymore."
394.72,400.96000000000004," This faction is so much better as far as, um, she's like, you level up really fast."
400.96000000000004,405.20000000000005," Before I ever got off the newbie island, I was level 17 and like when he 20s the ceiling."
405.20000000000005,406.20000000000005, Let's go.
406.20000000000005,407.20000000000005, Okay.
407.20000000000005,408.20000000000005, Okay.
408.20000000000005,409.20000000000005, So why is that good though?
409.20000000000005,413.84000000000003, Why is it good that you got to level 17 on the newbie island with the level 20 cap?
413.84000000000003,419.84000000000003," Well, the whole logic behind Guild Wars has always been that, you know, like the grind"
419.84000000000003,422.36, for the grind to be as minimal as possible.
422.44,426.36, Like that whole leveling up is just a very small part of the experience.
426.36,432.72," And it's sort of something, it's not really what the game is about."
432.72,437.72," I mean, I know like, wow, you know, it's just like a constant race to get to the next level."
437.72,440.6, That's just kind of like what the whole game is.
440.6,444.28000000000003," You know, same with like ever quest and other typical games."
444.28000000000003,445.28000000000003, So what are you doing?
445.28000000000003,447.28000000000003, He's breaking my mind.
447.28000000000003,450.28000000000003, I haven't broken any of my shit.
450.28000000000003,451.28000000000003, You broke my silver guild Wars?
451.32,452.11999999999995, So what are you doing?
452.11999999999995,452.32, Yeah.
452.32,453.32, You're doing missions?
453.32,455.11999999999995, You then you just play the missions in the campaign.
455.11999999999995,456.52, You play through the story missions.
456.52,458.84," And then there's, there's a lot of skills not unlock."
458.84,462.67999999999995," You know, I mean, like the whole thing in Guild Wars, Guild Wars is all about your character"
462.67999999999995,464.0," skills, right?"
464.0,465.2," Each class has, right?"
465.2,469.4, Some of the between 75 and 100 skills.
469.4,471.47999999999996," And I mean, you can have a level 20 character."
471.47999999999996,475.15999999999997," If you don't have a good skill combination, you're still pretty worthless."
475.15999999999997,476.76," Damn, that's a lot of skills."
476.76,480.03999999999996," It's kind of like, um, is it kind of like managing the gathering?"
480.04,482.40000000000003," That's, yeah, they're picking out what skills you want to listen to."
482.40000000000003,484.28000000000003, That's always what I've kind of compared it to.
484.28000000000003,485.6," Yeah, that's a lot of work."
485.6,486.44, Having it is fun.
486.44,489.76000000000005, It's fun when you get like a really effective combination.
489.76000000000005,492.20000000000005," But isn't it kind of funny though, like you could say, like, you can play"
492.20000000000005,494.52000000000004, wow until level 60 and you don't consider that a problem.
494.52000000000004,498.24," And then like, just a matter of saying, okay, you hit max level, but I want to just"
498.24,499.8, go around and earn the skills afterwards.
499.8,500.8, Right.
500.8,501.32000000000005, It's weird.
501.32000000000005,506.16," I mean, because, right, I like, I like the having the gold, the leveling."
506.16,510.40000000000003," But in, wow, like I still deceive the same weapon I always use."
510.40000000000003,514.6800000000001," I use the same spells I always use, but that doesn't, that doesn't bore me for whatever"
514.6800000000001,515.6800000000001, reason.
515.6800000000001,517.9200000000001, Like I like the goal of the leveling.
517.9200000000001,522.28, And I think I get overwhelmed by the choices of having to make skill choices.
522.28,523.28," You know, really?"
523.28,527.6, I always like playing with new skills when I get them just to see what else my character
527.6,528.6, can do.
528.6,532.5600000000001, The whole leveling had always been sort of like this boring hamster wheel kind of experienced
532.5600000000001,533.5600000000001, to me.
533.5600000000001,534.5600000000001, Yeah.
534.5600000000001,535.5600000000001," Well, I'm like a hamster."
535.56,536.56," Yeah, why?"
536.56,542.3199999999999," All right, we got the peanut gallery over here is talking behind our backs here."
542.3199999999999,544.56, Do you have something to share with the class over here?
544.56,545.56, Yeah.
545.56,547.56, We're going through the most recent issue now.
547.56,552.4399999999999," Just point out all the, oh, they're in steep involvement in the realms of ever quest"
552.4399999999999,553.4399999999999, never quest to.
553.4399999999999,554.4399999999999, Yeah.
554.4399999999999,558.1199999999999, It's a teaser for June.
558.1199999999999,562.88," I actually, I voluntarily set in the pit and was a GM for a day."
562.88,565.3199999999999," Well, actually, yeah, a weekend, actually."
565.32,566.32, And busted a gold farmer.
566.32,568.5200000000001, That was a great idea.
568.5200000000001,569.5200000000001, That story.
569.5200000000001,570.5200000000001, Yeah.
570.5200000000001,571.5200000000001," Yeah, that was a lot of fun."
571.5200000000001,573.32," And actually, I got a shout out to the guys over here."
573.32,574.32, So they were really cool.
574.32,576.7600000000001," Let me just, you know, there just be a jerk for a couple days."
576.7600000000001,577.7600000000001, Right.
577.7600000000001,580.48," So, right, Darren spent a day, a full day."
580.48,582.7600000000001," Well, it was actually two days, two days."
582.7600000000001,589.2," Down at Sony online, plugged in as a GM, a game master in their online game."
589.2,594.36, And he fielded questions and petitions from people playing the game who did not know that
594.36,595.36, he was a CGW editor.
595.36,600.0, So we got a really cool and funny sort of behind the scenes at what these poor people
600.0,601.4, have to deal with day in and day out.
601.4,605.88," And actually, I say the biggest surprise from that story was that everyone that I dealt"
605.88,608.84, with was so actually pretty cool about it in reasonable.
608.84,612.88," I busted some guy who's last name, who does it from behind."
612.88,617.48," And he was like genuinely surprised that like, you know, that someone was offended by"
617.48,618.48, the name.
618.48,619.48, So really.
619.48,620.48, Yeah.
620.48,621.48, Exactly.
621.48,623.84," Apparently, well, he was a, he was a, what an assassin, a hunter I forget."
624.84,627.1600000000001," So he changed the, he changed his name with, you know, he had no problem."
627.1600000000001,630.1600000000001, She knew I was expecting this huge fight and kind of ironic.
630.1600000000001,635.48," You're a guy who, who set the changes names multiple times in online games."
635.48,636.48, Yeah.
636.48,639.48," And I think the best one was getting tagged in like one, one email with like, I think five"
639.48,640.76, names that were offensive.
640.76,645.44," Did, did, did, did your finger on the red button corrupt you that quickly, though, that"
645.44,650.0400000000001, you were ready to assume the role of Hall Monitor and either made such zeal.
650.0400000000001,651.0400000000001, Right.
651.04,654.5999999999999," It's like, you know, I mean, because think about it, it's like my name is porn to kill"
654.5999999999999,655.5999999999999, in battlefield.
655.5999999999999,659.5999999999999," And like I said, you go into the wrong server and immediately people start, you know,"
659.5999999999999,661.5999999999999, complaining if they don't ban me outright.
661.5999999999999,663.1999999999999, And then now you're that guy.
663.1999999999999,664.5999999999999, I'm that jackass.
664.5999999999999,668.68," Well, you know what, I was, I mean, I just did, I, I basically try to follow their rules"
668.68,669.68, for the day.
669.68,673.28," But then when I got to the file, my, my, my, my, my, my, my tracking down that the, the,"
673.28,676.5999999999999," gold, the Chinese gold farmer, I just said, okay, now I got to screw this guy."
676.5999999999999,678.52," Did you ever feel like, what's it, Skinner?"
678.52,680.52," What was that, what was that thing experiment?"
680.52,683.6," Yeah, I was talking the prisoners in the other room."
683.6,685.6, I think you have the ball.
685.6,688.4399999999999," I don't talk from, uh, my threats exactly."
688.4399999999999,690.4399999999999," You know, I didn't got being with the phone."
690.4399999999999,694.88," According to totally, I kind of was, it's somewhere in some weird way I was kind"
694.88,696.92, of hoping to be that jerk and just totally abused the power.
696.92,701.64," But, uh, that's another part of it is that they actually had these safeguards in place"
701.64,705.4399999999999," so you couldn't abuse the power back when, um, back when it's still, you know, when"
705.4399999999999,710.28," it was, you know, 99 studios or, um, there's like, it was like the wild west."
710.28,714.64," I mean, like, I was talking to one guy who has told me how old GMs would catch some"
714.64,719.4," dude gold farming and they would jump into that character, um, possess them and have"
719.4,720.4, them walk off a cliff.
720.4,722.12," Wow, just imagine awesome."
722.12,723.12, I know.
723.12,724.12," But that can still happen, can it?"
724.12,729.4," I mean, isn't the, like, the wild controversy that happened with the, uh, GBLT thing"
729.4,733.3199999999999, because a GM sort of made a decision on his own to do something?
733.3199999999999,734.3199999999999," Well, right."
734.3199999999999,737.0799999999999," But I mean, like, you know, making a decision like that's one thing, sure."
737.0799999999999,739.4," But actually, like, jumping in and possessing another character."
739.48,742.16," Yeah, we're actually just like typing something that you quilted up a slash kill and"
742.16,743.4399999999999," saying, okay, get out of my way."
743.9599999999999,744.64, Can't be great.
744.64,745.68, I wish I had that power.
747.4,749.6," Totally, I'm the worst person with that skin or box experiment."
751.4,755.64," So yeah, so that's an our June issue along with the, uh, the cover story on"
755.64,758.0," sport, which we're, which we're very excited about."
758.6,759.6, Why I am because I wrote it.
760.4,761.1999999999999, When you got a D.C.
761.1999999999999,766.52," But, um, but, um, but yeah, the cover, if you guys haven't seen it, it's been posted on"
766.52,771.48, my blog and it's on kataku.com and gamingsteaf.com picked it up.
772.1999999999999,775.88," And, uh, you know, I don't think they're showing this game of D3."
775.96,776.4399999999999, Are they?
776.4399999999999,778.36," Uh, you know what, actually, they are."
778.36,779.1999999999999, They are.
779.1999999999999,784.04," I think maybe a little behind closed doors, but, uh, a little insidery stuff, but"
784.04,785.56," like, why are just having a party, actually?"
785.56,786.56," Uh, okay."
786.56,787.1999999999999," And like, we'll write a game."
787.1999999999999,787.72," Oh, that's right."
787.72,788.1999999999999," Well, right."
788.1999999999999,788.92, It's going to be doing it.
788.92,792.4399999999999," But, but this game is not going to get a whole lot of exposure at E3."
792.76,796.3199999999999," So if you want to know about sport, you got to read our magazine."
797.0,797.52, That's right.
797.52,798.56, We're not going to tell you anything about it here.
798.76,799.96," Yeah, not a word."
799.96,800.76, Pay a pitch.
802.04,802.92, Close.
803.64,804.68," Uh, let's see."
805.0,805.8, What else have we been playing?
805.8,807.28," I, oh, I got the heroes."
807.28,811.6," Five builders, I said, and I've been playing a lot of that game and it is really good."
811.72,817.52," So I have to extend major kudos to a Neval interactive and, uh, you'd be"
817.52,823.64," soft for, for actually doing quite a, uh, an amazing magic trick here of, of pulling"
823.64,827.88, a dead franchise back up by its bootstraps and making a good game.
827.88,828.88, Okay.
828.88,829.88, I had no hopes for this.
830.1999999999999,832.92," Man, you know, and actually, well, two things I can't wait for one seeing the,"
832.92,835.4," that might and magic's going to come about with the dark, you know, dark"
835.4,837.16," with the, you know, dark with the eye of the, they should add off recently."
837.72,838.56, That look pretty cool.
838.56,839.56, That game looks awesome.
839.56,843.56," I don't know how it's going to, you know, they actually, they said it ties into the,"
843.56,844.84," like the storyline, right?"
844.84,845.84, Yeah.
845.84,846.84, Yeah.
846.84,849.3199999999999," I forget in the moment, but they, they're, like, basically it's, I guess they're kind"
849.3199999999999,852.56," of you get a some sort of trilogy where the story is, like, one leads into the"
852.56,853.56, other.
853.56,854.56, Yeah.
854.56,858.4799999999999," The story in these heroes games are, is never, maybe they'll do a good job of it in"
858.4799999999999,859.4799999999999, the dark Messiah thing.
859.4799999999999,864.0," The armies of Eric Kesh, the clash with the arm of the Nebel tight pretty much."
864.0,867.68," I mean, all I do is like, hit the, hit the skip button every time and just get to the"
867.68,869.4799999999999," battle, you know, it's like, whatever."
869.4799999999999,874.04," I'm freaking princess has been kidnapped and, yeah, yeah."
874.04,875.68, You say mighty beastly.
875.68,877.68, It gives me stuff to kill.
877.68,881.8399999999999," But, uh, yeah, I mean, coming out of E3 with darkness, I will definitely be seeing a lot"
881.84,883.9200000000001, more of it's one of the things I'm looking forward to the show.
883.9200000000001,885.4," It's got a, a dark Messiah, right?"
885.4,889.32," They'll be showing the multiplayer, which we've talked about in our cover story before, but"
889.32,891.08, we're going to get some hands on time with that.
891.08,892.08, Yeah.
892.08,893.08, Can we just see that?
893.08,894.76, I'm also really looking forward to crisis.
894.76,899.6, Some of the other stuff that's come out of that game is that we didn't talk about quite
899.6,900.6, so much.
900.6,904.1600000000001," It's just the vehicle segments, the parts where, uh, I guess the, the devs are really"
904.1600000000001,908.2," been in Germany, a really big fans of top gun and, and wanted to create that since they"
908.2,910.72, wouldn't flying through clouds and this and that.
910.72,914.76," So it's got, it's got all these dimensions and then just down to the geek level and"
914.76,919.12, in addition to the recent videos we caught coming out of the game developers conferences
919.12,920.12, here.
920.12,923.52," Uh, they're doing a lot of work with animation and something and geek speak known as"
923.52,930.0400000000001," inverse kinematics, which is basically involving, uh, making characters, footfalls kind of"
930.0400000000001,934.4, like place accurately or realistically against the geometry.
934.4,937.5600000000001," So instead of that sliding feeling, you get in so many games, right?"
937.56,940.9599999999999," Especially in shooters and first person games, you know, you see characters kind of skip"
940.9599999999999,945.28," and slide around the environment, but this time, you know, aliens, humans, whatever it is."
945.28,948.28," And it just adds the overall immersion that feel that, you know, you're really there"
948.28,950.52, and it just consequences for actions.
950.52,951.68, I like to skip though.
951.68,952.68, Have they?
952.68,957.64, Have they come out with the information of what the systems are going to need to run
957.64,958.64, crisis?
958.64,959.64," It's, it's scalable."
959.64,963.68," I mean, of course, with, you know, the, the cry, the cry tech guys with Far Cry went"
963.68,966.2399999999999, the other direction where they had this massively scalable game.
966.24,968.04, It would work on a variety of systems.
968.04,974.16," And this one, they do want to push you toward, you know, a direct X 10 type of experience."
974.16,979.04," But at the same time, from what I understand, though, uh, there's going to be a new version"
979.04,983.44, of direct X nine that's going to approximate some of these things that are capable
983.44,984.44, in the other.
984.44,987.6," And so if you want the water down version and you're, you're having upgraded to direct X 10"
987.6,990.32," system, you'll be able to get a degree of that there."
990.32,995.12," Um, but if your computers old or middling right now, I'd say no, but if you can need"
995.12,996.5600000000001, a thousand gigs of RAM.
996.5600000000001,997.5600000000001," Oh, great."
997.5600000000001,998.5600000000001," No, definitely not."
998.5600000000001,1000.2, Just kidding.
1000.2,1001.2, Just kidding.
1001.2,1002.2, 500.
1002.2,1005.12," Now, that game looks pretty amazing."
1005.12,1009.2," Uh, anything else that we're looking forward to, do you think we are going to be a D3 next"
1009.2,1010.2, week?
1010.2,1016.28," We should say all next week, all of the gaming industry, including us here, your humble editors,"
1016.28,1019.04, will be at the E3 convention in Los Angeles.
1019.04,1020.88, And we're actually going to podcast from down there.
1020.88,1024.32, We hope if we can all find each other in the same place.
1024.32,1026.3999999999999, And time from the show floor.
1026.3999999999999,1030.9199999999998, But what else are we really excited about seeing down there?
1030.9199999999998,1036.32," You, I'd say for me, it's like, I always enjoy the surprises that I find in the back corners"
1036.32,1037.32, the halls.
1037.32,1039.8799999999999," Like everyone's like, everyone keeps their eyes for like, you know, the big boo, this"
1039.8799999999999,1040.8799999999999, and stuff like that.
1040.8799999999999,1043.6799999999998," I mean, there's obviously this, like, gothic three and stuff like that."
1043.6799999999998,1044.6799999999998, Yeah.
1044.6799999999998,1047.6799999999998," But I mean, like, even like just diving into like Kenche Hall and looking into, like, this"
1047.6799999999998,1048.6799999999998, is not really stupid.
1048.6799999999998,1053.08," If you look at like one C or book or any of these companies like at a Europe, it's"
1053.08,1056.8," stuff that gets bought up eventually by, by Ubisoft and gets brought to the States."
1056.8,1057.8, Right.
1057.8,1062.04," Chris, you can't just off and has those like weird like device, you know, like the,"
1062.04,1063.04," oh, I love that stuff."
1063.04,1065.6," You know, the, like the hats with, with my son."
1065.6,1066.6, That kind of thing.
1066.6,1069.4399999999998, Creek explanation for the listeners is to what Kenche Hall is.
1069.4399999999998,1070.4399999999998, Yeah.
1070.4399999999998,1071.4399999999998, Okay.
1071.4399999999998,1072.4399999999998, Okay.
1072.4399999999998,1073.4399999999998, Yeah.
1073.4399999999998,1074.72, You guys are frequent visitors to head to you.
1074.72,1079.12," It's like all like the guys who can't afford the big boo, this kind of like the,"
1079.12,1082.72," right, isn't that that's the slang for that's what you can't cheer for."
1082.72,1085.0," That better, both, right, isn't that what you can't call."
1085.0,1088.0, Then there was a little bushbell humor.
1088.0,1091.0," So, thank you, Charlie."
1091.0,1094.8," This is the place where you want, you know, I don't think anybody's going to know"
1094.8,1095.8, that.
1095.8,1096.8, Bushbell.
1096.8,1097.8, Yeah.
1097.8,1098.8, Okay.
1098.8,1103.3600000000001," But you go there if you, if you want to see, you know, $10, kickboxing, Sims and, you know,"
1103.3600000000001,1107.68," product descriptions that are like with product fun time we all have and that, the"
1107.68,1108.68, things that we're going to.
1108.68,1109.96," The English, the English there is awesome."
1110.04,1113.24," Like, I usually, I usually we have a digital photo scavenger, huh, every year."
1113.24,1114.8, And that's where I get all my primataryl.
1114.8,1116.6000000000001," Just, just, just, just, awesome."
1116.6000000000001,1117.44, Don't flip back on it.
1117.44,1120.1200000000001, You're just saying that now that's where the real underdogs come up with.
1120.1200000000001,1122.08," Well, sometimes, you know, that's, that's the case, too."
1122.08,1124.04," But I mean, like, you get a, right."
1124.04,1125.76," Yeah, it's one of the great things about the show."
1125.76,1128.24, It's just seeing the stuff we never heard of.
1128.24,1130.2, We would never expect to see.
1130.2,1133.8400000000001," And I mean, some of it is, is silly and ridiculous, but everyone's in a while."
1133.8400000000001,1135.24, There's something very cool there.
1135.24,1136.24, Who are there?
1136.24,1139.64," No one, Kenche Hall, at least for the couple of, last couple of years has had a very good"
1139.64,1140.64, real T sandwich.
1140.64,1143.76, And there's the Ryan Scott report.
1143.76,1144.92," The hopefully, the hunt for that."
1144.92,1146.88, We know I would like to go to LA this week.
1146.88,1148.88," So, just thinking about that grilled T sandwich."
1148.88,1151.0800000000002, I'm also looking forward to seeing it by our show.
1151.0800000000002,1152.0800000000002," Yeah, meet it."
1152.0800000000002,1153.0800000000002, Definitely.
1153.0800000000002,1154.0800000000002, That's going to go.
1154.0800000000002,1157.4, I think that's my number one must see game there.
1157.4,1159.3600000000001," That, yeah, there's a bunch of games like that."
1159.3600000000001,1160.3600000000001, It kind of got heard about that.
1160.3600000000001,1161.8000000000002," I want to just see an action, huh?"
1161.8000000000002,1163.76, Crisis definitely want to see where that's at.
1163.76,1166.16," Apparently, for Ryan, it's grilled cheese."
1166.16,1168.4, And then what game after the grilled cheese sandwich?
1168.44,1169.48," What's the, what's the, what's the, what's the,"
1169.48,1170.48," like, about that?"
1170.48,1173.64," Do you know your grilled cheese sandwich, what would you like to see there?"
1173.64,1176.76, I'd actually kind of like to see more crisis as well.
1176.76,1178.0800000000002, That game is way to jump on that.
1178.0800000000002,1179.0800000000002, Really pretty.
1179.0800000000002,1180.0800000000002, I think.
1180.0800000000002,1181.92," Well, I'm usually not a big shooter."
1181.92,1182.92," Yeah, you're not."
1182.92,1183.92, That's true.
1183.92,1187.3600000000001, The frustrating thing will be seeing games like the new Wolf and Stein and knowing
1187.3600000000001,1193.0400000000002, that they're being demonstrated as console product first and having to wait for the announcement
1193.0400000000002,1195.64," that, you know, hey, versions of these are coming to PC too."
1195.96,1199.5600000000002," And what about, you know, is there a call of duty coming to the PC at this point?"
1199.5600000000002,1200.4," That's another one, right."
1200.4,1201.0400000000002, All right.
1201.0400000000002,1201.68, Good question.
1201.68,1207.1200000000001," That was, is it just going to be another defector to the console and just, you know, leave us by twisting"
1207.1200000000001,1207.96, into wind exactly.
1208.96,1209.8000000000002, Last word on that.
1209.8000000000002,1214.0, I want to throw a quick aside in there that I called duty to multiplayer.
1214.0,1219.76," I didn't, I didn't do a review at the time for it, but the multiplayer is massively disappointing."
1219.76,1223.8000000000002," And recently, you know, just seeing this past few weeks, they finally patched it through"
1223.8799999999999,1228.6," to, you know, pervasive cheating problems that didn't ship with punkbuster protection or prevention."
1229.08,1233.8," And the crazy thing is within hours of that new patch and the punkbuster coming out,"
1233.8,1238.36, people had already hacked around it to the same old hacks that they had been using prior to
1238.36,1241.36," that basically punkbuster in it, right, with punkbuster in it."
1241.36,1245.9199999999998," So basically, and the game itself is really, it's fun, but it was multiplayer."
1245.9199999999998,1249.72," It was like a step back from the United Defense of Expansion Package, basically call of duty"
1249.8,1250.72, one multiplayer.
1251.0,1253.76, And then now add just the rampant cheating to it.
1253.76,1254.92, And it's been a big disappointment.
1254.92,1255.92, So there's my quick rant.
1255.92,1261.16," Sorry, you know, to pop just, it's not topic, but no, so I like those games."
1261.16,1262.16, I want to see him do it right.
1262.16,1264.96," And it's just a bummer that, I mean, it's not all their fault."
1264.96,1268.4," People need to quit cheating and stuff too, but it's, it's at the point now where if you're"
1268.4,1271.8," not cheating, it's almost cheating is just becoming the new standard for it."
1271.8,1276.76," So ever you can level the playing field by getting the hacks, but you're basically playing"
1276.76,1280.12, World War II with Superman's X-ray vision.
1280.12,1285.28," I think that's, I think Sean just said the most Pauling anish thing I've never heard"
1285.28,1287.12," and say, people need the quit cheating."
1287.12,1289.12, Like that's gonna happen.
1289.12,1293.12, And most of the critical thing I've ever considered to be coming from.
1293.12,1298.68," Yeah, look, she, I, I greaf right, though, and he hacks, but that's a cheat."
1298.68,1299.68, Not will hack.
1299.68,1302.52," I might exploit now, and then that's a whole lot of things."
1302.52,1303.52," That's fine, shades."
1303.6,1310.08," I mean, if you, how, how wicked we are, you know, and exploit, obviously it's there,"
1310.08,1315.16," anyone can do it, you don't need to, yeah, you don't, you don't cheat to win, right?"
1315.16,1317.16," You're not, you're not like, right?"
1317.16,1318.8," I mean, I, I, I, I don't you grieve."
1318.8,1320.16," I don't cheat, yeah, yeah."
1320.16,1321.16, Yeah.
1321.16,1323.44," And that's, and that's more like, I put a positive spin on it."
1323.44,1326.44," It's like, you know, video game jackass or something."
1326.44,1328.6," Right, right, improv."
1329.52,1333.52, So there's a one reader question I wanted to read this week.
1333.52,1340.48," Unfortunately, whoever the doofus was who compiled this, get me, Darren, didn't get the name of the reader."
1340.48,1341.48, So we apologize.
1341.48,1342.7199999999998, I don't have to say anything.
1342.7199999999998,1344.24, You guys do it to yourselves.
1344.24,1345.7199999999998, Classic self-loaters.
1345.7199999999998,1351.8799999999999," So we, we apologize to you, reader X, but this is your question, whoever you are."
1351.8799999999999,1353.24, And we love you.
1353.24,1355.28," All right, curious question."
1355.36,1360.36," Quad, I found myself getting into more console titles the past few years after being"
1360.36,1365.68, mostly a PC exclusive gamer ever since getting a C64 as a kid.
1365.68,1371.36, So I was wondering how often any of you play console games during your free time.
1371.36,1375.04," Also, what are your opinions about console and PC gamers being able to play together with titles"
1375.04,1377.8, like Final Fantasy 11 and the upcoming Huxley?
1377.8,1381.3999999999999," Okay, so do we play console games in our free time?"
1381.3999999999999,1382.3999999999999, Yeah.
1382.3999999999999,1383.3999999999999, Oh yeah.
1383.8400000000001,1386.68, Do we all own all of them currently in existence?
1386.68,1387.16, Yeah.
1387.16,1388.2, It's getting close to it.
1388.2,1388.72, It's a famous.
1388.72,1390.72, I don't own an Xbox 360 yet.
1390.72,1391.72, What mean either?
1391.72,1392.44," Yes, yeah, I don't either."
1392.44,1393.44, Huh?
1393.44,1395.0400000000002," Oh, he's get everything the day comes out."
1395.0400000000002,1395.72, I don't know.
1395.72,1396.6000000000001, Always been the only.
1396.6000000000001,1398.24, I keep waiting for Microsoft to send me one.
1398.24,1403.0, I'll get an Xbox 360 when Street Fighter 2 Turbo goes on Xbox Live.
1403.0,1404.52, It's a coming.
1404.52,1407.0," You can play Uno on it right now, though."
1407.0,1408.92, Do an Xbox Live Arcade on that's pretty cool.
1408.92,1409.68, I got to tell you.
1409.68,1410.3200000000002, This is really cool.
1410.3200000000002,1411.72, Like games on it.
1411.8,1414.32, I'm jealous of the Solar achievements thing.
1414.32,1417.72," The subset for me, I have to say the question, I mean, you know, coming from"
1417.72,1421.3600000000001," EGM, electronic gaming monthly, a console, a mega point."
1421.3600000000001,1425.44, I had been in first and foremost a console gamer who became a PC gamer and then this
1425.44,1429.64," ties into the other part of this question, which is that what about these games where both"
1429.64,1431.32, groups can play together?
1431.32,1434.76, And it was actually in the Dreamcast with Quaker Arena.
1434.76,1435.76, Quaker?
1435.76,1438.72, We already were coming together is when I started making the switch.
1438.72,1443.28, So I started playing that and I saw the advantage that the guys with both on the Dreamcast
1443.28,1445.76, mouse and keyboard on the PC had.
1445.76,1448.88, And then so I went and I bought those peripherals for myself to use them.
1448.88,1451.88," And then after that, that was like, wow."
1451.88,1452.88, This is a nice way.
1452.88,1453.88, It was a real gaming.
1453.88,1456.68, So then I started upgrading my computer and from then the rest was history and I continued
1456.68,1457.68, to play both.
1457.68,1458.68, Your first taste is for a platform.
1458.68,1459.68, It's at the same time.
1459.68,1462.48, But I think that was a really cool thing.
1462.48,1466.16," I kind of wish, I mean, I'm glad that more games are going to be doing that sort of thing."
1466.16,1470.48," Really, it's not an antagonistic way in the way that Quaker Arena was where you're placing"
1470.48,1473.8400000000001, the controller guys against the mouse players.
1473.8400000000001,1477.76, But we're supposed to be in that game interacting and helping one another.
1477.76,1482.2," They might come to us for some assistance on a mission, you know, in a cooperative mission"
1482.2,1486.96," or the, and then, you know, we interact in ways like that without actually being able"
1486.96,1488.1200000000001, to smack them down.
1488.1200000000001,1490.44, But we need this wall to come down.
1490.44,1491.44, Once and for all.
1491.44,1493.72, I'm a severs as a console thing.
1493.72,1494.72, It's ridiculous.
1494.72,1495.72, I think it's old.
1495.96,1500.2," Well, yeah, especially in this day and age, you know, thanks to like 360 with X&A, you"
1500.2,1503.2," could have games that can work really well together, like, like, Huxley."
1503.2,1506.84," I just keep thinking of some scenario where like, you know, there's obviously a vantage"
1506.84,1510.8," of first person, you know, a PC gamer is going to have over a console game with first"
1510.8,1512.3600000000001, person shooter stuff.
1512.3600000000001,1515.3600000000001," So what if like the PC gamer is like, you want to, you want him in your squad as the"
1515.3600000000001,1519.16," gunner, then you have some other dude who's like the wheel man or something."
1519.16,1522.6000000000001," The vehicle thing does actually make sense because especially in cases where, like, you"
1522.6000000000001,1525.68," know, Huxley's going to have, you know, in future combat and vehicle combat."
1525.68,1530.3200000000002," And oftentimes, like a dual analog controller will be the distinct advantage when it comes"
1530.3200000000002,1531.3200000000002, to vehicle control.
1531.3200000000002,1535.4," A lot of people use those on the PC side too for, and they'll switch between that"
1535.4,1537.4, or a flight stick on certain games.
1537.4,1539.4, So that can definitely make sense.
1539.4,1544.04," Yeah, just play with the strengths of the platform is what it is all I'm saying."
1544.04,1548.5600000000002," Which reminds me, just total a slight tangent because I've been playing auto assault recently."
1548.5600000000002,1552.5600000000002, And one thing I really like how they did is that I have a wired 360 controller that I plug
1552.56,1554.08, into my PC.
1554.08,1558.6799999999998," And if you just go into the options menu, check off the use joystick thing and it maps every"
1558.6799999999998,1563.2," single button, every control you need, right to the Xbox controller."
1563.2,1568.0," So the left the right analog stick controls the turrets, the left one does the movement"
1568.0,1570.3999999999999, and you can anything you need.
1570.3999999999999,1572.8, But you can't use a wireless Xbox controller.
1572.8,1573.8, Correct.
1573.8,1574.8, Right.
1574.8,1575.8, It's interesting.
1575.8,1576.8799999999999," We're seeing, you know, less and less of that."
1576.8799999999999,1577.8799999999999, This versus that.
1577.8799999999999,1578.8799999999999," Yeah, you can't."
1578.8799999999999,1579.8799999999999, We're using their controller.
1579.88,1583.48, They've got hard drives now and are getting patches and downloads.
1583.48,1584.48, Right.
1584.48,1585.48, It's nice.
1585.48,1587.1200000000001," It's kind of a generational shift, maybe."
1587.1200000000001,1591.4, Don't you think it's possible that it's time marching on here like everybody has
1591.4,1592.4, everything now.
1592.4,1593.4, Right.
1593.4,1594.4, What are the things that used to be?
1594.4,1598.4, We want the Xbox Lifetime Player Matching and Services.
1598.4,1600.4," They've got the USB ports, but don't use them."
1600.4,1602.8400000000001," I mean, it's all kind of, I got to tell you."
1602.8400000000001,1608.68," When I started that, CJ got a new convergence in 17, what year was it?"
1608.72,1609.68, 49.
1609.68,1611.92, The air of our Lord.
1611.92,1615.5600000000002, There was such an anti-consult bias on the staff.
1615.5600000000002,1618.68, It was like at a control.
1618.68,1623.96, It wasn't considered like the same level playing field.
1623.96,1626.3600000000001," There wasn't a like, well, a pro and con thing."
1626.3600000000001,1629.0," It was just flat out, console gaming sucks."
1629.0,1632.64," But I mean, I've been reading just since the beginning day."
1632.64,1636.8, I remember there being a time when like CJW would be reviewing it like console game
1636.8,1637.8, like Turbo graphics 16.
1637.8799999999999,1640.56," Yeah, so that's in the old old days, like in the 80s."
1640.56,1647.3999999999999," But like by say 1996 or so, and I started in 1997, there was clearly a line drawn."
1647.3999999999999,1653.96," And like I remember when the N64, the day the N64 launched, we got it and there"
1653.96,1657.76," are somebody on the floor, not CJW got it."
1657.76,1659.76, And bought Super Mario.
1659.76,1664.9199999999998, And everybody in the whole floor was looking at Super Mario and a couple of the CJW editors
1664.92,1669.04, walked in while we were all looking at it and just basically scoffed at this game.
1669.04,1673.04," And really, it's kind of mean while Karmac and Romero were looking at saying, wow, how"
1673.04,1674.04, could we do this?
1674.04,1675.04, Right.
1675.04,1676.04, And it was unreal to me.
1676.04,1680.64," I mean, I was at CJW at the time, but I was appalled by that sort of attitude."
1680.64,1681.64, Just because it's on a concept.
1681.64,1683.96, It's still holding the attitude so pervasive.
1683.96,1688.28," On the console side, you get it in finer shades of, you know, oh, I play Xbox games,"
1688.28,1689.28, I play Sony games.
1689.28,1691.92," And then it's the whole, you know, I only read Marvel comics."
1691.92,1693.24, I don't read DC comics.
1693.24,1696.44, But then you can just take the argument just gets more ridiculous.
1696.44,1698.28," It would be like, well, I only see movies."
1698.28,1700.04," You know, I don't watch television or something like that."
1700.04,1704.36," I mean, it's like if you, if you like the medium, read the Marvel comics that are good,"
1704.36,1705.92, read the DC comics that are good.
1705.92,1709.36," If you like games, I think it's a good PC games, quite a good console games."
1709.36,1713.16," You know, you know, I, I draw a lot of times, like, you know, PC gamers to a degree,"
1713.16,1716.8," or kind of like those guys who, you know, drive around, modded cars with the dubs and"
1716.8,1717.96," the new, like, small enough stuff."
1717.96,1719.36, These are the guys who were like the tweakers.
1719.36,1721.0, And they kind of like considered themselves.
1721.0,1722.0, They sit tweakers.
1722.0,1723.0, Totally.
1723.0,1724.0, And then that's that.
1724.0,1725.0," Yeah, exactly."
1725.0,1726.0, Two.
1726.0,1727.0, That's where I am.
1727.0,1729.6," Anyway, but the point is, like, they kind of like have to set themselves with a certain"
1729.6,1730.6," station above others, I guess."
1730.6,1731.6, Yeah.
1731.6,1732.6, The insecure ones at least.
1732.6,1735.24," If I used to write about that a long time ago, it seems less prevalent."
1735.24,1740.68," Now, but I used to, you know, write about that sort of perceived, you know, PC gamers, superiority."
1740.68,1744.84," And I used to say, like, do you know how the whole rest of the world looks at all of us"
1744.84,1749.44," as gamers, you know, like you're no different than them in the eyes of people who don't"
1749.44,1752.96," play games, you know, where all immature losers."
1752.96,1757.8400000000001," You know, so don't set yourself above the guys playing Mario because no one else can tell"
1757.8400000000001,1763.0, that difference between someone playing Mario on an Nintendo and you playing Quake on your
1763.0,1764.0, PC.
1764.0,1766.6000000000001," You know, you hear that?"
1766.6000000000001,1769.56," Yep, you're all losers."
1769.56,1770.56, That's right.
1770.56,1772.2, You on the bus right now listening to this.
1772.2,1776.88," Oh, the other, I thought to myself, some of the convergence topics, like, more and more"
1776.88,1782.16," playing console games on the PC monitor, you know, because they don't have high res"
1782.16,1783.16, TV or whatever.
1783.16,1787.68," And actually, I like being closer now, city, you know, a lot of times console hardcore"
1787.68,1791.0," people will say, you know, I at least like get to relax on the couch or something."
1791.0,1794.96," But I like to be like, have my face right up in every some reason, you know, just like"
1794.96,1796.44," feel more attached, more immersed in it."
1796.44,1798.8000000000002, So it's fun playing them on the monitor too.
1798.8000000000002,1799.8000000000002, Mm-hmm.
1799.8000000000002,1801.8000000000002," Yeah, I got to tell you, I consider saving up some bones."
1801.8000000000002,1806.72," Man, it's totally worth the biggest dilemma I've had recently is debating whether I play"
1806.72,1810.3600000000001," a living in on the PC or the 360, just for one very simple reason."
1810.4399999999998,1814.12," I have a huge has TV that I just invested a lot of money in and I'm like, kind of a huge"
1814.12,1815.12," monitor to them, man."
1815.12,1816.12, That's true.
1816.12,1818.0, Give me the monitor and you can play it on the TV.
1818.0,1821.8," Okay, Darren Glatzon has the world's biggest PC monitor."
1821.8,1825.24," And the biggest thing, I like to compensate for something."
1825.24,1828.0," Okay, well, you said it not us."
1828.0,1829.76," No, it's a matter of public record."
1829.76,1830.76, So awkward now.
1830.76,1831.76, HR.
1831.76,1839.7199999999998," So yeah, I've had cancer that question just to sum up, we all play console games here a lot."
1839.72,1843.56," For me, it's more than any other kind of gaming."
1843.56,1846.28," For me, it's like I'm off the clock, you know?"
1846.28,1849.92," Like any PC game, even if I'm not reviewing it, I still feel like I sort of have to have"
1849.92,1854.6000000000001, my brain engaged so that I have an informed opinion on it.
1854.6000000000001,1859.3600000000001," And I mean, I guess I want to have informed opinions on console games, but it's not technically"
1859.3600000000001,1860.3600000000001," my job, right?"
1860.3600000000001,1869.2, So I could just sit around and play whatever shut up the classes or brain age on the DS and
1869.2,1871.44," not have to think, you know?"
1871.44,1872.92, It doesn't feel like work to me.
1872.92,1875.68, Because gaming is such hard work otherwise.
1875.68,1876.68, So what's your brain age?
1876.68,1879.28," Well, it was me 28, it's my brain age."
1879.28,1880.28, Yay.
1880.28,1881.28, That's fine.
1881.28,1885.16," I play a lot more on the PC in my free time, which is like, I wonder if that would flip"
1885.16,1888.44, when I switched from the console magnet to the PC magnet because at the console magnet
1888.44,1890.4, I played PC more in my free time too.
1890.4,1893.0800000000002, And I figured maybe it was something like you're talking about and feels like I'm not
1893.0800000000002,1894.0800000000002, working.
1894.0800000000002,1899.1200000000001," But no, still play is it's the whole multiplayer part that makes me..."
1899.12,1901.6," It's a pretty, it's a 50-50 mix for me."
1901.6,1903.6, Although I spend a lot of my time looking at...
1903.6,1904.6, So I'm kind of lame.
1904.6,1906.6799999999998," I actually spend a lot of my time looking for free where I'm like, look, look, look"
1906.6799999999998,1908.84, and put those like indie games and stuff.
1908.84,1910.08, They're looking for free stuff.
1910.08,1911.08," Oh, I imagine that."
1911.08,1912.08," Yeah, okay."
1912.08,1918.2399999999998," Speaking of quick, I played Robert Coffee and his column falling pieces mentioned a couple"
1918.2399999999998,1919.2399999999998, of free games.
1919.2399999999998,1924.04," We're not free, but demo is of games, you know, that you're download and one of them's"
1924.04,1925.8," Mozak, the tomb of mystery."
1925.8,1928.8, And it's actually a pretty fun game.
1928.8799999999999,1929.8," Oh, yeah."
1929.8,1934.08," In that it's unlike, you know, it's not just another riff on the old falling"
1934.08,1935.08, blocks paradigm.
1935.08,1939.2," It's actually, that's basically a puzzle composed of these little pieces and you"
1939.2,1943.08, play some in whatever order you want and goes from there and gets more complicated.
1943.08,1944.08, But it's a pretty cool game.
1944.08,1945.08, Right.
1945.08,1946.08," Yeah, do we have the role in the magazine?"
1946.08,1948.68," Because we could read it off now for those, listen, 95."
1948.68,1951.28," Yeah, it's reflexive.net."
1951.28,1953.08," Oh, those are guys into, yeah."
1953.08,1955.8," Mozak, they've done some good stuff."
1955.8,1956.8, Check out the rest of their games too.
1957.04,1957.8," Oh, yeah."
1957.8,1959.48, And then the Tetris Makers new game too.
1959.48,1960.48, I downloaded that.
1960.48,1962.84, It's called twice and not feeling that so much.
1962.84,1963.84, The twice?
1963.84,1964.84, Yeah.
1964.84,1965.84, The guess kind of losing it.
1965.84,1966.84, My opinion.
1966.84,1970.8799999999999," You say, well, you know, if you want hit, if you've made that one, just lump for that."
1970.8799999999999,1971.8799999999999, Yeah.
1971.8799999999999,1972.8799999999999, Yeah.
1972.8799999999999,1977.48," I think you can retire after you made Tetris, you know, Alexi, not feeling twice."
1977.48,1978.8, Okay.
1978.8,1981.08, We maybe were done here.
1981.08,1982.08, Are we done?
1982.08,1983.08, Yes.
1983.08,1984.28," We're just going to need our caro red, then I guess."
1984.28,1985.28," Oh, the taro."
1985.28,1986.28, Yeah.
1986.28,1989.08, I should say that sitting in front of me this whole time that you've been listening
1989.08,1993.56," and we've been talking, I have here as of Might and Magic 5 taro cards."
1993.56,1996.32," They're actually nice looking cards, don't you think, grand?"
1996.32,1997.32, Yeah.
1997.32,1998.32, Very nice.
1998.32,1999.32, Okay.
1999.32,2001.84," In fact, Ryan took one of the boxes."
2001.84,2003.56, He was so excited about it.
2003.56,2005.2," You know, you got your fancy artwork here."
2005.2,2007.72," Anyway, I'm not just bringing up his door excited."
2007.72,2008.72, Yeah.
2008.72,2009.72, Okay.
2009.72,2012.72," You're going to read our work again, yeah."
2012.72,2013.72, Yeah.
2013.72,2014.72, I'm going to read your taro on the air.
2014.72,2018.28, I'm not mentioning these just to say we got them and you didn't.
2018.28,2023.3600000000001," I'm actually mentioning them because we want to give away a few boxes of heroes, five"
2023.3600000000001,2027.76, taro cards to give to you folks out there.
2027.76,2032.6000000000001," And we don't have to make this a complicated, complicated contest."
2032.6000000000001,2038.28," I would say like, why don't you just send me a note saying you want one at my blog,"
2038.28,2039.28, the C.D.W.
2039.28,2040.28, Jeff.
2040.28,2042.0, Docs1Up first.com.
2042.0,2045.28, Just few who email me and say they want taro cards.
2045.28,2048.12," This is definitely on the dark arts though, so just be ready."
2048.12,2049.12, Be very careful.
2049.12,2050.12, Right.
2050.12,2055.72, It's made to any kind of mild Satanism or what is this here?
2055.72,2058.24," That's yeah, that's kind of satanic evenology."
2058.24,2059.76, That's like a book for your computer.
2059.76,2060.76, Right.
2060.76,2061.76, Okay.
2061.76,2064.16," So if you get these taro cards and then go on to commit some like, you know, bad"
2064.16,2070.28, crime or if your parents hate you after this or send you away to reform school or
2070.36,2072.5600000000004," a convent, you know, don't blame us."
2072.5600000000004,2073.5600000000004, Blame video games.
2073.5600000000004,2075.5600000000004, Blame video games.
2075.5600000000004,2077.5600000000004, They're evil.
2077.5600000000004,2083.0," Okay kids, we'll see you next week and when you hear from us, we will be at E3."
2083.0,2084.2400000000002, How exciting.
2084.2400000000002,2086.2400000000002," We, we."
2086.2400000000002,2087.2400000000002," Oh, no."
2087.2400000000002,2088.2400000000002, Another we.
2088.2400000000002,2089.88," Okay, we're out."
2089.88,2090.88, Goodbye.
2090.88,2091.2400000000002, See you next time.
