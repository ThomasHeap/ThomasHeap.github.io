81.0,84.0," Ryan, the wonderful in the room who was not on virgin."
84.0,85.0, Yeah.
85.0,90.4," So virgin air, if you've been flying like USO in airlines, that's like you're just traveling"
90.4,91.4, in time.
91.4,92.4, They're like 1975.
92.4,93.4," Yeah, that's so fascinating."
93.4,94.4, That's the future.

95.6,97.4, This plain doom at a rave.
97.4,98.4, Yeah.
98.4,104.8, We have been to the future and we like it there.
104.8,105.8, You weren't kidding.
105.8,111.92," They have doom on the, on the, you know, every seat back has a monitor on it."
111.92,112.92, And there's games.
112.92,113.92," Well, there's all sorts of shit on it."
113.92,114.92, And on it.
114.92,115.92, And one of them is a game.
115.92,117.92, And there's got doom on there.
117.92,118.92, Like doom one?
118.92,119.92, Yeah.
119.92,120.92, Wow.
120.92,124.36," And the remote, your, first you're thinking like, okay, what is, there's going to be some"
124.36,125.36, cheesy remote.
125.36,126.8," You know, like, you've been to a hotel right."
126.8,127.8, Right.
127.8,129.0, And they've got an N64 control right.
129.0,132.36, And you're playing games for some other non N64 system.
132.36,133.36, Right.
133.36,134.36, It's a one in 10 or something.
134.36,136.52," But this, there's this fully developed control."
136.52,138.52, This controller's like the best thing ever.
138.52,142.2," It's like a controller on one side and a remote control on the, I swear, that was like"
142.2,143.2, the best hour of my life on that.
143.2,147.04," And, and, and, and the, and the, I was, I was, I was sitting next to Jeff."
147.04,148.04, He was so excited.
148.04,149.04, I know.
149.04,150.04, I do.
150.04,151.83999999999997, Everybody else on the plane just sitting there trying to get to the hour.
151.83999999999997,152.83999999999997," And I'm like, oh my God."
152.83999999999997,156.23999999999998, Jeff was even playing the word search game.
156.23999999999998,157.23999999999998, Nice.
157.23999999999998,158.56," But that, that pissed you off."
158.56,162.12," The word search game pissed me off because it's one of those games where like,"
162.12,166.0," a whole bunch of letters come on and then you have to, you make us many words as he can"
166.0,167.67999999999998, in a certain amount of minutes.
167.67999999999998,169.67999999999998," And hi, he, R AM."
169.92000000000002,172.6," Tram, that's not a word."
172.6,173.6, Apparently not.
173.6,175.76000000000002," Yeah, according not to virgin fucking Airlines."
175.76000000000002,176.76000000000002, I like that way.
176.76000000000002,177.76000000000002, I like them.
177.76000000000002,179.72," You know, just like, it's like movies."
179.72,183.6," They're not going to show you any movies that have like, you know, airline crashes"
183.6,184.6, and stuff like that.
184.6,189.04000000000002," Yeah, you're playing the word thing and then like, you come up with like, crash or like, tragedy."
189.04000000000002,190.04000000000002, Terrorists.
190.04000000000002,191.04000000000002, Yeah.
191.04000000000002,193.04000000000002, Oh my God.
193.04000000000002,194.04000000000002, That would be so awesome.
194.04000000000002,195.76000000000002, Because you could kind of watch other people play.
195.76000000000002,199.44, I was watching the person play in the role in front of me and she was so dumb.
199.44,200.92, She wasn't getting any of the words.
200.92,205.92," I mean, I was watching Tina, community manager play and she got hoisted."
205.92,206.92, And that's good.
206.92,207.92," That's like, hoisted."
207.92,212.52, That sounds like my experience today watching other people play games.
212.52,213.52, Yeah.
213.52,217.36," Like, before we jump out of the airline, there's more to say, actually, there is."
217.36,220.8," The ray part comes from the fact that the interior of the plane, you tell us to"
220.8,223.04," Ryan since you guys know, it's already."
223.04,230.04," It's all like 2001 style, just like aesthetic to it, all just rounded plastic and whatnot."
230.04,232.28," Yeah, the seats are like white rounded plastic."
232.28,234.28, They have mood lighting in the plane.
234.28,237.44," And if it's, if you're taking an evening flight in our case, it was all just like a kind"
237.44,240.44," of a deep, dark purple and their plane, techno music."
240.44,243.44," Oh, it was not my first set at eight, 45 in the morning."
243.44,244.64, But they do change the tint.
244.64,246.07999999999998, They do change the color tint.
246.07999999999998,247.07999999999998, I've heard.
247.07999999999998,248.48," Well, that's what I've heard."
248.48,251.68, And even like the inflight safety instead of having someone stand up there and try to get
251.68,256.96," you to pay attention for the 6,000 time about how to put life jacket on."
256.96,260.88," They have just this like animated, this slickly animated thing that plays on the screen"
260.88,262.2, and your TV.
262.2,267.64, But what I loved about Virgin this time and the last time I flew it is the people who
267.64,271.04, work on the plane are actually really nice.
271.04,272.04," Yeah, they were really nice."
272.04,277.04," I flew with, it was the first time I flew with my son."
277.04,283.96000000000004, So I had like a car seat and a little baby and I was by myself and they assigned me a flight
283.96000000000004,288.76000000000005, attendant to stand in line while we were getting on the plane to hold no way.
288.76000000000005,290.04, This is the best place.
290.04,291.04, I love them.
291.04,293.96000000000004," Yeah, so we're Virgin a radio."
293.96000000000004,302.24," Yeah, this podcast sponsored by, yeah, it was just a fantastic."
302.24,305.36, Like I never want to fly anywhere else in any of the other airlines.
305.36,307.8, I'm just going to be going on a manifest on Virgin.
307.8,309.28000000000003," Be like, you're on the screen."
309.28000000000003,310.8, They're going to fly only places that they fly.
310.8,311.8, She's playing doom.
311.8,312.8, What's going to happen?
312.8,315.72, Think to play if like someone gave it to you for your DNA.
315.72,317.92, I played doom for 10 minutes.
317.92,320.16, It was just the novelty that I could do it.
320.16,322.68, Then I did get on the word game until I got pissed off.
322.68,325.2," Not on those tram, not a word, but con wasn't a word."
325.2,326.2, C-L-N.
326.2,328.48," Even small things like, you know, I'm still mad."
328.48,329.48, You're mad.
329.48,330.48, You bring up a digital map.
330.48,332.6," You know, zoom in when you want."
332.6,334.6," Oh yeah, you can do that."
334.68,336.88," You can chat with your neighbors too, do you know that?"
336.88,337.72, You can.
337.72,338.72, That could be a bad thing though.
338.72,340.52000000000004," Yeah, you could look at that."
340.52000000000004,341.52000000000004, Get some of the rides.
341.52000000000004,342.52000000000004, Get some of the fucker.
342.52000000000004,343.52000000000004," Yeah, right."
343.52000000000004,344.52000000000004, I'm in the middle seat.
344.52000000000004,345.88, I get most armrests.
345.88,346.88, Yes.
346.88,348.52000000000004, So I don't know.
348.52000000000004,349.52000000000004, That was great.
349.52000000000004,352.48," Yeah, so maybe happy to bring it into E3 in games."
352.48,354.52000000000004," You're saying like, we all know the experience."
354.52000000000004,356.68, It's hard to watch someone else play a game.
356.68,361.76000000000005," But in this case for me, I just got the watching mirror's edge and it was weird because,"
361.76,367.36," it is, you know, in the demonstration videos, everyone's moving really fluidly running"
367.36,369.0, from one jump to another.
369.0,370.0, Sorry.
370.0,371.0, Right.
371.0,373.0," Yeah, every noise."
373.0,376.76, So everyone's like running from one running from one platform to another.
376.76,377.76, And it's super fluid.
377.76,380.44," It looks like free running a park where you know, and it's all about that kind of"
380.44,381.44, heck or bad.
381.44,382.84, But they want people who are playing it.
382.84,387.44, It would be super timid and they walk up to a ledge and they'd look down and
387.44,388.44, they think about it.
388.44,389.64, They're going to jump and grab the rope.
389.64,392.4," Yeah, that's glowing, telling them to jump and grab them."
392.4,393.4, Yeah.
393.4,395.56, Then they would miss a jump and they'd back up and do this.
395.56,399.68, And I can imagine it was really difficult for the people demonstrating it to watch
399.68,401.8, because it's the opposite of what they want.
401.8,407.24, And they know that the challenge for this kind of game is that it's like first person.
407.24,409.88," And a lot of people in the math, sorry."
409.88,411.24, I keep doing this right.
411.24,416.47999999999996," A lot of people in the math market have a hard time with, you know, not motion simulation"
416.48,421.44," sickness and things like that, but vertigo, but just like, right, with challenges in that"
421.44,422.92, point of view.
422.92,426.44," That game is going to be a big, that's going to be the big count on that game."
426.44,431.6, What I don't understand about that game and I know everybody's all about it.
431.6,437.0," You know, it was like, it got, it got this huge applause and people were like, titillated."
437.0,444.12, But it's about park or which is something you see and looks really cool from a third person
444.12,445.12, perspective.
445.12,450.04," And when you have an in first person, it's like, yeah, you're experiencing it and you're"
450.04,451.64, making the choices.
451.64,453.64, But you don't get to see the cool moves.
453.64,459.04," And I feel like given the setting of the game, it's not Prince of Persia."
459.04,462.16," You know, I mean, everybody wants to say, well, that was Prince of Persia, but it wasn't,"
462.16,464.12," you know, I mean, Prince of Persia was so different."
464.12,466.4, I'd like to see a third person.
466.4,467.4, I have a core game.
467.4,468.4, That's funny.
468.4,469.4, I really like the first person.
469.4,471.88, I was bringing it up like not because I think it's bad.
471.88,472.88, I think it's fantastic.
472.88,476.28, But I just imagine that they had a difficult fight with the A.
476.28,477.8," I mean, this is speculation."
477.8,478.8, They probably didn't.
478.8,481.12, But it seems like they would to convince them.
481.12,482.12," No, I said they did."
482.12,487.08," No, this is not, this is going to be first person because we want to communicate the"
487.08,492.24," vertigo and just the disorientation, what it's like to roll to come out of a run and"
492.24,494.6, roll and then just keep moving.
494.6,499.04, But because there have to be people saying that that's not like safe.
499.04,501.0, There are gaps to what you're going to be able to do.
501.0,505.04, And I was granted the demonstration that there is so straightforward.
505.04,508.04, And I was able to now kind of like a straight line.
508.04,511.36," Yeah, after a single viewing of theirs, yeah, these other people would do it."
511.36,512.76, I'm not saying I'm better than anything.
512.76,513.76," No, no."
513.76,517.2," We'll clearly in this case that that game I was for that demo, but the point was it's like,"
517.2,520.16, I want to please be better than this because I don't want this to have.
520.16,521.16," Yeah, I watched it."
521.16,523.4, I want the guy I was getting the demo with.
523.4,527.24, It was another journal's hand that he was some foreigner.
527.24,530.24," And he, uh, we'll call him Schmoh."
530.76,532.28, For the purposes of this guy.
532.28,534.12," Yeah, although his real name."
534.12,535.12," No, I won't say it."
535.12,536.12," I didn't see it, actually."
536.12,542.36," But anyway, you know, the guy did the demo for us, the guy from a dice."
542.36,545.12, And then he turned it over.
545.12,546.28, He was handing the control over.
546.28,549.6, And I didn't want to do it because it is distracting here.
549.6,550.36," You're right, Sean."
550.36,551.36, It's hard to talk.
551.36,552.36, He got a lot of back there.
552.36,554.6800000000001," You got to get almost, you got to get past the noise."
554.6800000000001,557.8," Yeah, when you start hearing, go into the night."
557.8,558.8, Yeah.
558.8,559.8, Shut up.
559.8,568.8," Okay, so, uh, I think I got louder."
568.8,575.16," Okay, so I didn't want to take the controller because I thought, uh, I didn't want"
575.16,576.52, to suck in front of that guy.
576.52,577.9599999999999, And the game does look intimidating.
577.9599999999999,578.9599999999999, It does.
578.9599999999999,581.7199999999999," Like, I was just thinking, I want to play this on my own when no one's looking."
581.7199999999999,584.64, So I can let this other guy play because he's probably going to be a good gamer as
584.64,585.64, opposed to me.
585.64,588.12, And this guy was so bad.
588.12,589.4399999999999, Like it was unbelievable to me.
589.4399999999999,594.4," But what you said about it, must be hard for the guys demoing to watch people playing badly."
594.4,597.52, Like I totally was watching that happen throughout the whole thing.
597.52,601.4, And the guy was trying to be polite and he's like the host and he's representing the game.
601.4,602.8, And he doesn't want to get bad.
602.8,604.68, And he's a professor with a first jump in the game.
604.68,606.08," Yeah, and he's a big, very patient."
606.08,609.4399999999999," Like, okay, see, well, what you really wanted to hit F2."
609.4399999999999,610.4399999999999, Like I told you.
610.4399999999999,611.4399999999999, Yeah.
611.4399999999999,614.24," No, again, you have to hit F2."
614.32,618.24," You know, he kept trying to repeat, like, see, well, you know, you need to complete the"
618.24,619.64, jump where you're going to die.
619.64,621.24," You know, he had to keep telling guys."
621.24,622.24," You know, painful."
622.24,623.24, That this is the case.
623.24,624.24, Wow.
624.24,625.24, Playing it.
625.24,629.72, Think about how technical platforming 30 platforming was in like anything for half life.
629.72,632.24, One to like remember the tour arc that came out for N65.
632.24,633.24, Yeah.
633.24,634.84, You didn't even have two analog sticks in the platforming.
634.84,638.24, And there was more difficult than anything I've seen in Mirz Edge.
638.24,641.44, But it's like the expanding market that's making the difference.
641.44,647.44," You know, we're aware when we see this that someone that are causing or someone's not going to be able to do it."
647.44,652.44," Yeah, I guess I'm surprised that a game journalist wouldn't be able to pick it up though."
652.44,658.44," I mean, is it psychological that they don't think they're making the same kind of jumps?"
658.44,661.44, What I watched this guy do was exactly what Sean was saying.
661.44,667.44," It's like, you know, there would be a ramp, you know, and to, it just makes common sense."
667.44,672.44," You know, you run off the ramp to make the jump, you know, and this guy would like walked him at least."
672.44,675.44," Yeah, just though the ramp and then just go forward."
675.44,678.44," I got, okay, well, that's going to be a false to your desk more on."
678.44,680.44, But what I want them to do in this game.
680.44,686.44, This is my request is I want them to be able to as in like skated or skate.
686.44,689.44, You should be able to take movies over carry.
689.44,690.44," Yeah, I hear what you're saying."
690.44,694.44," Like, yeah, that to not get like the money shot if you're doing the cool thing."
694.44,698.44, I see both perspectives because they were being very adamant.
698.44,705.44, I mentioned this in my little brief appearance on on on one of yours was that I asked the first question.
705.44,711.44," I asked the guy was like, would you ever under any circumstance think about backing this camera up when or two feet?"
711.44,714.44, So we could like see our feet because that's going to be a problem for a lot of people.
714.44,715.44, You can by looking down.
715.44,718.44," Yeah, but yeah, but you see a lot of the shoes."
718.44,721.44, And then it's just to look to me like it was just the very tip of the shoe.
721.44,724.44, I don't know if you look all the way down.
724.44,727.44," Yeah, see, but then they mean it didn't seem like in motion."
727.44,730.44, Except when she was sliding under something.
730.44,733.44," What you would do like, especially with the mouse if you're playing on PC."
733.44,734.44," Yeah, you have a high DPI setting."
734.44,737.44, It would be fairly easy to run toward a ledge.
737.44,742.44, Snap your mouse down and see your feet the moment before you hit the edge and the side now is when I'm going to jump.
742.44,743.44," Yeah, just as quickly rotate your."
743.44,745.44, I guess if you pull back in front of you.
745.44,749.44," That's, but that's more work than say if they just pulled the camera back all the way."
749.44,751.44," So you could see the whole body, but anyway, his."
751.44,752.44, I don't admire him.
752.44,755.44," I mean, but his answer to that was like, no, we'll never do that."
755.44,757.44, And we don't care if people complain.
757.44,758.44, This was the game we're making.
758.44,759.44, Right.
759.44,760.44, I thought that was cool.
760.44,761.44," Yeah, it's good to do that."
761.44,768.44," A few things when I when I first started playing out, I really wanted to see because the initial demo level is absolutely linear."
768.44,771.44," Yeah, there's just a straight line."
771.44,778.44," Yeah, so I wanted to see if there were circumstances where they're using the level design to prevent you from going."
778.44,785.44," I mean, where they're naturally just using the level design to prevent you from accessing things and then they're not just doing the equivalent invisible walls and stuff."
785.44,793.44," Well, what he did say that I thought was interesting was that even though that was just a straight line, he was saying that there's actually multiple paths."
793.44,800.44," Down that line and that you're going to want to replay it because later in the game, you're going to figure out how to do things way differently."
800.44,805.44, And so you're going to go this one way right now because that's just what your brain is going to tell you to do.
805.44,809.44," But that later on, you're going to realize it or maybe like three or four ways down this exact same thing."
809.44,810.44, That they're designing.
810.44,813.44," Yeah, they're like designing four speed runs in a way."
813.44,822.44," Yeah, like there was one that was demonstrated that was like by doing a series of wall runs to to climb to a roof much quicker than you could just by scaling the side of the wall."
822.44,830.44," But the difference there is in safe environment was was wider than that and through experimentation, you could find things that maybe they hadn't anticipated."
830.44,832.44," I mean, that's not the game they're making."
832.44,833.44, That's totally fine.
833.44,842.44," I mean, that the whole thing seems to be about about just getting through this environment's fast as you can and normally in games of the store, what's happening is that you feel pulled forward."
842.44,846.44, There's always something you're trying to get in this case the game is pushing you forward because you're running from it.
846.44,849.44," You know, there's going to be things chasing you and stuff and because."
849.44,855.44," In the level that we played, there's really nothing going on, but in other circumstances, you're going to have helicopters and soldiers and stuff after you."
855.44,856.44, You're not going to be stopping this thing.
856.44,858.44," Well, wouldn't be so much cooler if I could actually get up here."
858.44,860.44, You're just going to keep going.
860.44,874.44," I think there's a there's a lot of levels that serve as an example for that, you know, in darkness, I might magic the second level has a whole stage that's basically you, you know, running full speed to get somewhere in some platform things."
874.44,877.44, There's some like that and have life to right.
877.44,878.44, What?
878.44,879.44, What?
879.44,881.44, I think nothing.
881.44,882.44," Yeah, I'm just."
882.44,889.44," No, I'm just I'm thinking about how you said I was a procrastinator and suddenly feeling guilty."
889.44,898.44," See, I the story there is that Sean and Ryan and I were, you know, we wanted another voice on the podcast this week."
898.44,904.44," And so right next to where we're podcasting basically the whole one up cruise over there writing their stories,"
904.44,906.44, Proposting for your reading pleasure.
906.44,912.44," And I said, so who wants to be on the on the podcast on the FW radio and Jen like bolted up."
912.44,917.44," I think it came in and I was like, you just did that because you have stuff to write."
917.44,919.44, You were a tiny procrastinating.
919.44,920.44, Pretty much.
920.44,923.44, So maybe the room will get locked up when we're done.
923.44,925.44, That'd be awesome.
925.44,930.44, I have except I'm the one to whom I have to make the excuses were not doing my work.
930.44,932.44, So just be you and your content.
932.44,934.44, It's that infinite loop.
934.44,937.44, So can let's back up on E3 this in general.
937.44,938.44, I want to say a few more things about.
938.44,940.44," No, yeah, yes, you can."
940.44,941.44, It was.
941.44,942.44, It's a medically.
942.44,943.44, I think there's a lot that can do with it.
943.44,946.44, The whole notion is that this is it's instead of like a big brother environment.
946.44,951.44," I mean, they're calling it like, you know, like a nanny, just open and so the observations still there."
951.44,954.44, It's just it's not so.
954.44,955.44, Just bastardly.
955.44,958.44," I mean, it's it's not quite the same degree of like control."
958.44,961.44, But but so you see there's like surveillance cameras throughout the level.
961.44,964.44," And there's a news helicopter trying to watch you and you're basically,"
964.44,970.44," as this like free runner, you're basically the only means of non observed communication."
970.44,972.44," Basically like four years, something."
972.44,975.44," And if I did, I mean, I mean, I guess like the way I try to get it from them is if."
975.44,979.44," If asking if they think that it's the story that people will talk about after word,"
979.44,983.44," which is kind of like, I mean, if you had asked that about portable before you played it,"
983.44,986.44," you've probably been surprised if they confidently said, yeah, we hope so."
986.44,987.44, Right.
987.44,990.44, So I want to I'm curious to see what they do with that element of it.
990.44,991.44, The other.
991.44,992.44, They had to want to point out those interesting.
992.44,998.44," I don't know if they show you, but the level that is sort of in the underground and it's based on the normest Tokyo."
998.44,1001.44," Oh, they did show that the Tokyo sewers."
1001.44,1002.44," Yeah, yeah."
1002.44,1003.44, That was really cool.
1003.44,1004.44, That very cool.
1004.44,1010.44," Yeah, just drawing, I think for some of the environments just drawing from places as this part is like Tokyo is insane underground."
1010.44,1015.44," I mean, some parts that reminded me of like Vancouver and British Columbia."
1015.44,1018.44," I mean, just a different sort of setting for a game."
1018.44,1023.44," And that similar level too is like, I thought that the opening level was kind of vertical inducing."
1023.44,1027.44," Holy crap, the second level was, Riddus like was like scary."
1027.44,1030.44," Yeah, because it's a cathedral ceiling underground."
1030.44,1034.44," Yeah, with just you know, incredibly horrific drops."
1034.44,1035.44, Yeah.
1035.44,1036.44, So okay.
1036.44,1038.44, So I got a my system. What about E3?
1038.44,1041.44," Well, I just wanted to it's our first day here."
1041.44,1044.44, And it is in and this is a whole different scene here at E3.
1044.44,1047.44," And I don't know if one appears talked about it, but it is not it might be interesting."
1047.44,1056.44," Just to go into what's going on at this show, which is like, this is the second year in a row that is kind of in this like shadow of its former self thing."
1056.44,1061.44, But we're back in the original setting that we've been at for forever.
1061.44,1065.44," And earlier today when I was sitting in an endema, I was buying a shit out of me."
1065.44,1069.44, I just started spacing out on a on E3 in general.
1069.44,1072.44, And I realized this is my 11th E3.
1072.44,1074.44," Rho, which is a lot."
1074.44,1078.44, And this one is probably the weirdest one just because we're in the original setting.
1078.44,1083.44," I've been in every year except with like what, a tenth of the people."
1083.44,1085.44, It makes me sad.
1085.44,1093.44," I never thought that I would be somebody who was like, oh, this year or that year was the glory days."
1093.44,1097.44," But like, a lot of other years could qualify as the glory days."
1097.44,1100.44," And this year, it makes me sad."
1100.44,1102.44," Yeah, I mean, there are no manners."
1102.44,1104.44, A lot of people are saying this.
1104.44,1111.44," I disagree, but I mean, I know you disagree, but you first, first thing you said to me was I like it."
1111.44,1117.44," But I, I feel, I mean, I took a picture outside and there were like three people in my picture."
1117.44,1119.44," You know, it's good to be there."
1119.44,1121.44, I don't think there are no.
1121.44,1123.44, Format McCarthy presents.
1123.44,1129.44," I feel like, I feel like, um, you know, it's a sign of the times."
1129.44,1132.44," You know, it's like bad economy recession."
1132.44,1133.44, But it's not really.
1133.44,1137.44, It's just the way they decided to invite and not invite.
1137.44,1141.44," Yeah, I don't mean in fact, the place could be teeming if they had just let it."
1141.44,1142.44, Yeah.
1142.44,1148.44," And the fact that like, well, for one, like, the whole thing I like it more because in the past today,"
1148.44,1157.44, I spent like what I feel is like more meaningful time with X number of games that might have taken me two days in the past in the pasty three in this center.
1157.44,1162.44, And instead of walking in and having there be like a line of 10 people with inflatable feelings.
1162.44,1164.44," See, I haven't even been back."
1165.44,1167.44, And I have not even gotten there.
1167.44,1172.44, I have been out and about all day in like demos and press conferences.
1172.44,1173.44, So maybe that's the different.
1173.44,1177.44," When you go, yeah, when you go to each of the rooms to play a game, it's like, they sit you down."
1177.44,1178.44," Yeah, it's playable."
1178.44,1179.44," Yeah, it's playable."
1179.44,1180.44, You get to play it.
1180.44,1183.44," You don't like, there's, it's just not like the annoying circus it was before."
1183.44,1186.44," And while, like, yes, it was really impressive to the world."
1186.44,1189.44," And it kind of, like, I think that the inadequacy people feels it like,"
1189.44,1192.44," This is, you know, the previous E3s were like, you know,"
1192.44,1194.44, gaming is coming out party to the world.
1194.44,1195.44, Yeah.
1195.44,1196.44," So like, look at us."
1196.44,1197.44," We're, we're big."
1197.44,1199.44," We can, we have the same money as you with not more."
1199.44,1200.44, We can do this.
1200.44,1202.44," And now it's like, they're still spending the money."
1202.44,1206.44, They're still flying people to Morocco to all these different places for these events.
1206.44,1209.44," Morocco is for a guild of worse things, some time ago."
1209.44,1211.44," But, but they're having these pre-e3s."
1211.44,1214.44," But they're getting, they're doubling up on the coverage because it's like,"
1214.44,1216.44," Well, yeah, in particular, they had two pre-e3s."
1216.44,1220.44," So they get to cover each, they get coverage of each of these games."
1221.44,1224.44," Prior to the show, then we come to the show, and then they get even more coverage."
1224.44,1229.44," And so for less money on their part, they're getting more exposure than more awareness."
1229.44,1231.44, Yeah.
1231.44,1233.44, I'm kind of in the middle of both of you.
1233.44,1235.44," I mean, I see both sides."
1235.44,1238.44," I mean, definitely this whole thing here has like the feel of like a Kyra"
1238.44,1239.44, Practors can do now.
1239.44,1242.44," It's like, you know, 40 guys walking around."
1242.44,1246.44," But, and so that, and so that made me miss, and definitely in the past,"
1246.44,1249.44," I've had one of those guys just like, Oh, God, there's so many fucking people here."
1249.44,1250.44, I can't even move.
1250.44,1253.44, I can't get from here at Sierra Online too.
1253.44,1255.44," I mean, name two companies that don't exist anymore."
1255.44,1258.44," I can't get, I can't get from A to C."
1258.44,1263.44," I can't get from A to B without like, you know, 12 fat guys bump in me."
1263.44,1266.44, And I'm like 10 minutes late for the appointment because of all the points.
1266.44,1267.44, But it's not that they're just bumping you.
1267.44,1270.44, The others are taking pictures of themselves with boot babes and stuff.
1270.44,1271.44," Right, all that stuff."
1271.44,1274.44," And so that part, and annoyed me at the time, but there is something about like,"
1274.44,1277.44," the spectacle and like what you said, the sort of feeling of like,"
1277.44,1278.44, we're a big deal.
1278.44,1279.44, The show's a big deal.
1279.44,1281.44, That's totally gone here now.
1281.44,1285.44," And you can't, you know, you know, that shallow, you can't help a sort of feel like,"
1285.44,1289.44," I don't know, really are at the loser convention."
1289.44,1295.44," I guess, I just feel like, you know, what is the point of E3?"
1295.44,1303.44," And I know it had multiple purposes, but I feel like our point is to see all these different"
1303.44,1306.44, games in one place at the same time.
1306.44,1308.44," Yeah, so, and for that, this is better."
1308.44,1310.44," Yeah, like Sean said, this is definitely better."
1310.44,1314.44," At the same time, I wonder, is there any even any need for that?"
1314.44,1317.44, Because we can have access to games.
1317.44,1318.44, I don't say that.
1318.44,1319.44, I don't say that.
1319.44,1325.44," You know, so this has been the point for like, this has been in addition to the jobs we already do."
1325.44,1330.44," And so I sort of wonder, like, well, then for the other people, the sales and"
1330.44,1335.44," marketing people and retailers, you know, and fans, you know, for"
1335.44,1339.44," consumers, for them, is it serving their purposes?"
1339.44,1344.44," That, it doesn't seem like it because there is no, like, grandiose,"
1344.44,1345.44, spectacle.
1345.44,1351.44," Though the press conferences, you know, seem to be exactly on par with previous years,"
1351.44,1354.44, except there were no hideous lines to get in.
1354.44,1355.44, And that was nice.
1355.44,1356.44, Right.
1356.44,1357.44, From all for that.
1357.44,1359.44," So they were, were they easy to get in?"
1359.44,1360.44, All of them?
1360.44,1364.44," I mean, I only went to Nintendo and so on each today, but, you know,"
1364.44,1370.44, how you used to go to the check-in booths and there would be like 50 people
1370.44,1372.44," students warmed around from,"
1372.44,1373.44," Oh, God."
1373.44,1375.44," Was that like two years ago, Microsoft?"
1375.44,1376.44, Yeah.
1376.44,1377.44, That was like the last day of Saigon.
1377.44,1380.44, I'm trying to get into that goddamn steak.
1380.44,1382.44, It's become a chaotic.
1382.44,1384.44, Here's just like you saw it for a while.
1384.44,1387.44," Why did the falls, I got particularly good for mine?"
1387.44,1391.44," I just remember, like,"
1391.44,1393.44," You could have used to like, left for dead."
1393.44,1395.44, There were people like screaming and crying.
1395.44,1399.44, Maybe that wasn't a gossip.
1399.44,1402.44," Maybe the whole thing I was thinking before I even got here,"
1402.44,1404.44, I was thinking about how pointless it is.
1404.44,1406.44, I don't want this to be a bad example.
1406.44,1409.44," I mean, I tend to do this and get trouble because I take on our own stuff."
1409.44,1411.44," But I was looking at her site and I was looking at how, you know,"
1411.44,1414.44, where live-logging the Microsoft press conference.
1414.44,1417.44," And from a consumer's point of view, I was like,"
1417.44,1420.44," well, I can go watch this press conference right now."
1420.44,1425.44," And I was like, well, what are we going to get from from this kind of rapid fire coverage, right?"
1425.44,1429.44," I mean, because like, I think that yeah, like imagine if we were able to edit"
1429.44,1433.44," or realize if you had the time to think and react to the press conference in a normal way,"
1433.44,1436.44, then we could provide analysis and come into it and it would matter.
1436.44,1439.44," But if we're just like, but it's fast as you possibly can."
1439.44,1442.44, You can literally cannot keep pace with the events.
1442.44,1447.44, So you're basically doing a short hand of fact toys with a little bit of humor.
1447.44,1449.44," When you're able to put it in, I was wondering,"
1449.44,1454.44," what values that serve and likewise when you take an amplified to the entire show here,"
1454.44,1457.44," where we get these very quick impressions of these games,"
1457.44,1460.44," and then we have to go tonight, like as soon as we're done taping this,"
1460.44,1464.44," it's like, we need to go and write, write, write all these things as fast as we can."
1464.44,1468.44," Then it's all going out at the same time, this is just a giant shotgun blast,"
1468.44,1473.44," like coverage where we don't have time to really, you know, work things out and think them through."
1473.44,1475.44, And then everything is just there all at once.
1475.44,1477.44," I mean, how do you like, when what are you going to be clicking on?"
1477.44,1480.44," I'm curious for audiences, like, oh, just because you heard of this game,"
1480.44,1483.44," or I mean, is that the chance for, as opposed to, like,"
1483.44,1487.44," say if it was just more of a measured and well-paced type of coverage,"
1487.44,1491.44," where you're able to spend time with it and find, you know, what is the angle for this?"
1491.44,1493.44," Maybe this isn't the game that everyone's looking forward to,"
1493.44,1495.44, and maybe there's an interesting story to tell here.
1495.44,1499.44," It's definitely not going to be told in this context of this environment, right?"
1499.44,1501.44," So, interesting point, I mean, it would be, like,"
1501.44,1505.44," instead of live blogging a conference, it would be better if we could, like,"
1505.44,1510.44," be broadcasting it live, right, and be commenting on it, sort of like a political convention or something, right?"
1510.44,1513.44," Yeah, I'm going to tap you more fun if we work, you know,"
1513.44,1517.44," yeah, where we could, like, interject comments while, while they were talking."
1517.44,1519.44," Yeah, in a way, like, coming in part, just seeing."
1519.44,1521.44, Just Tom Brokeau Green here.
1521.44,1522.44," Yeah, right."
1522.44,1523.44," Well, you bet."
1523.44,1524.44, That was stupid.
1524.44,1526.44, But you can see.
1526.44,1527.44," Oh, same as animals."
1527.44,1534.44," You can't take anything away from your E3, EA, life plug."
1534.44,1536.44," Well, I was enjoyable."
1536.44,1539.44," I mean, it just depends what the point is."
1539.44,1548.44," And for me, it's always been, like, a milestone of where the industry is right now in this broad, broad stroke."
1548.44,1551.44," And I actually, I can't believe what I'm going to say is,"
1551.44,1554.44, but I kind of miss this sweaty fan voice.
1554.44,1556.44," Well, yeah, that's the weird thing."
1556.44,1559.44, This is kind of like a be careful what you would think.
1559.44,1561.44," Yeah, there was a plane about it."
1561.44,1562.44," Like, where are they?"
1562.44,1565.44," Well, the fact is, I'm going to get their picture taken."
1565.44,1567.44, And we see you come back with that voice.
1567.44,1568.44, Your knowledge.
1568.44,1569.44, What?
1569.44,1572.44," I've said, at least to acknowledge that you're, yeah, that you're in consistent."
1572.44,1574.44, I'll completely know beforehand.
1574.44,1577.44," You would, you would be exactly what you were asking for."
1577.44,1579.44, Why didn't you have to let so many fun?
1579.44,1581.44," No, this was like, we're taking pictures to go."
1581.44,1583.44," Of the police guy, I love to mix a shit."
1583.44,1585.44," Just to like, get it out of our system."
1585.44,1587.44," Like, do you see this?"
1587.44,1588.44, Do you see this?
1588.44,1590.44, Look at the fucking picture of you didn't see it.
1590.44,1591.44, No.
1591.44,1592.44," Like, now you don't have to do it."
1592.44,1593.44, But we met that.
1593.44,1596.44," Speaking of which, it's time to give this away."
1596.44,1601.44, They give it a viewmaster for Fallout 3 to the same tech 1000 holographic archive.
1601.44,1603.44, It's just like the viewmaster.
1603.44,1605.44," I'm that note, let's give it shout out."
1605.44,1606.44, Yeah.
1606.44,1607.44, Yeah.
1607.44,1608.44, Can't you haul?
1608.44,1609.44, Okay.
1609.44,1610.44, Or an RIP.
1610.44,1611.44, Can't you haul?
1611.44,1612.44, Because it's nothing I miss.
1612.44,1613.44," Yeah, you're right."
1613.44,1616.44, The home of thousands of great stories.
1616.44,1617.44, Can't you haul?
1617.44,1618.44, Yeah.
1618.44,1619.44, That's it.
1619.44,1622.44," Thank you, Kendra Hall."
1622.44,1623.44, Sean Baby Special.
1623.44,1625.44, She's exactly.
1625.44,1627.44, This would probably be on demo.
1627.44,1628.44, You're right.
1628.44,1629.44, None of those people are here.
1629.44,1630.44," No, we're on a day."
1630.44,1631.44, Wacky DVD.
1631.44,1632.44, Yeah.
1632.44,1633.44, Make it on DVD.
1633.44,1634.44, It's too expensive.
1634.44,1636.44, Archinsonian Mouse Company.
1636.44,1637.44, Yeah.
1637.44,1638.44, It goes one way or the other.
1638.44,1644.44, This is like before E3 was like the mall where they would have like the cheesy
1644.44,1646.44, dollar store and like the Walden books.
1646.44,1648.44, Mixed in with the Macy's and all that stuff.
1649.44,1651.44, And now it's like just the Macy's and stuff.
1651.44,1658.44, So there's going to have to be some place where there's like a strip mall that's nothing but like the tobacco shop and the dress barn.
1658.44,1662.44," And like, you know, this is like the saddest like many more."
1662.44,1667.44, Like you can get a haircut like it's triple XL size dress.
1667.44,1669.44, That's about it.
1669.44,1672.44, And Indian head dress.
1672.44,1675.44, And a VHS to rent.
1676.44,1684.44," You know what I heard a few days ago was that they actually when they were thinking, you know, because last year was in Santa Monica and now it's kind of a disaster."
1684.44,1687.44, So they knew they wanted to be back here at the convention center.
1687.44,1692.44, And I heard that the first thing that they were thinking of doing was doing it all in Kencha Hall.
1692.44,1698.44," You know, this is a smaller hall and then a bunch of the big publishers bought just because of the reputation of that hall."
1698.44,1699.44, Wow.
1699.44,1704.44, They thought that it was like going to be too much of a psychological bad thing like shit we're on the shit hall.
1704.44,1707.44," You know, even though there would be no other hall used."
1707.44,1710.44, No one wants to be in Kencha even if there's nothing else.
1710.44,1718.44, Because the various rooms that they have reserved now were in the past occupied by some of the the lowest caliber.
1718.44,1721.44, But anything better than Kencha is the thing.
1721.44,1724.44, This one up podcast is brought to you by G4.
1724.44,1727.44, You're a way to get inside the years biggest game event.
1727.44,1734.44, G4 will be on the convention floor live every day with exclusive hands on demos of over 30 of the biggest new gaming titles.
1734.44,1743.44," E308 live, we clung coverage July 14 through the 18th only on G4 visit g4 tv.com slash E3 for details."
1743.44,1745.44, Did anyone else see borderlands?
1745.44,1748.44," Yeah, I saw I was there with you."
1748.44,1749.44, What you think?
1749.44,1751.44, That was an interesting demo.
1751.44,1753.44, I don't see it.
1753.44,1755.44," Well, I don't know what your laugh."
1755.44,1757.44," Yeah, we have to break the break."
1757.44,1758.44, We can't inside.
1758.44,1759.44, What?
1759.44,1760.44, The shortest version of it.
1760.44,1761.44, Is that Ryan Scott?
1761.44,1763.44, I don't know what that was.
1763.44,1764.44, Good.
1764.44,1766.44, Good impression.
1766.44,1770.44, More and more like it's becoming an effective description of things.
1770.44,1775.44, It's just like whatever plus Diablo and borderlands basically seems to be drawing from the mentality of.
1775.44,1782.44," I mean, and this works for Donna Warner T right imagine RTS plus Diablo and in the case of borderlands."
1782.44,1794.44," It's first person shooter plus Diablo and the plus Diablo part of the equation just means in the ability to collect enormous amounts of loot, gain up and skill points, kill things and collect more items."
1794.44,1800.44," But in borderlands, I mean part of that they're boasting is that there's over a half million different weapons to get."
1800.44,1806.44," But then when we went and see this in action, that means like what you think this is what this is another thing it's going to come up to."
1806.44,1810.44, The whole quantity versus quality debate when we hear about how there's 500 different endings to follow.
1810.44,1819.44, Whenever someone says that you get into the point where like they're putting like a yellow sticker on a gun and suddenly it's a new one because the other one has a black sticker on it.
1819.44,1825.44," And so seriously, they've picking up all these guns and they just they do look stupid right I mean this is what happens."
1825.44,1837.44," I mean, you can cheat in a game that's like based on the real world that has say it has 20 weapons because even though all those are our weapons for the game, they were actually model on things designed for the real world and the people that were modeling them."
1837.44,1845.44," And so every interest in their success, for example, if you made like an odd stale or something, you end up getting it the Australian military to buy it or something."
1845.44,1849.44, It's not like you're throwing away you're making a hundred thousand prototypes just to toss out.
1849.44,1858.44, So the difference is like what I'm saying is like it's probably better to have five really good weapons in the Halo or something than to have five hundred thousand that are the same with different colored lights on them.
1858.44,1861.44, They really did.
1861.44,1869.44, They really did strike me to it and it was sad because of the demonstration ready pitch for it and I forget the other guy's name. We're so intent on making us like this game.
1869.44,1872.44," It was either okay, that's not a real demo."
1872.44,1874.44," Yeah, no either."
1874.44,1887.44," They're super, they're so genuinely impressed with their own game that we were hearing their enthusiasm or what I'm kind of leaves that they were one in and they said let's roleplay the eight year old who constitutes our ideal audience."
1887.44,1889.44, He is going to be reacting to it.
1889.44,1891.44, I think you're giving it too much credit.
1891.44,1898.44, So you're saying that they consciously ironically were roleplaying guys who are enthusiastic about their game.
1898.44,1900.44, When in fact they're not.
1900.44,1909.44," I'm not saying that they're not enthusiastic but to this extent to the point that like any time someone would pick up a gun and there's a gun to pick up anytime you kill someone to be like,"
1909.44,1913.44," Oh wow, look at that. Oh my god. That's a good shotgun."
1913.44,1915.44, I have to get your nose to go.
1915.44,1916.44, Oh he's taking no.
1916.44,1917.44, He's giving it.
1917.44,1919.44, I know I was trying to look at you look sideways at you.
1919.44,1921.44, I was like are they kidding with this enthusiasm?
1921.44,1923.44, That's a fucking great gun.
1923.44,1924.44, It's like your game.
1924.44,1925.44, The gun phone.
1925.44,1926.44, Whoa.
1926.44,1927.44, Look at that shotgun.
1927.44,1928.44, Close quote.
1928.44,1929.44, Oh my god.
1929.44,1931.44, I love that shotgun.
1931.44,1932.44, Another quote.
1932.44,1934.44," Wow, that shotgun."
1934.44,1939.44," It's like, you know the setting that life's getting where they're making fun of sharing or hair prod."
1939.44,1941.44," I mean, sharing or hair prodics."
1942.44,1944.44, I guess you didn't ever watch that in life.
1944.44,1945.44, It never was a Harley-Dase.
1945.44,1946.44, Oh yeah.
1946.44,1949.44," It was like, it's just like, oh my god, feel her hair."
1949.44,1950.44, How soft it is.
1950.44,1951.44, And someone else would feel it.
1951.44,1952.44," Oh, it's so soft."
1952.44,1953.44, How soft.
1953.44,1954.44, Oh my god.
1954.44,1955.44, It's so soft.
1955.44,1957.44, So it was like this with a damn gun in the game.
1957.44,1960.44, It was the dumbest gun I've seen in the game in a long time.
1960.44,1961.44, Yeah.
1961.44,1963.44," But watching it, I just like,"
1963.44,1968.44, everyone wants to hook into the bonuses that you get from incorporating the apple
1968.44,1970.44, like features in your game and those are obvious.
1970.44,1977.44," That's like, um, you have the great carrot there of getting people to continue to play and play and play because they're going to feel like they're getting something."
1977.44,1978.44, They're picking up something new all the time.
1978.44,1982.44, The downside though is just the whole quantity of equality thing.
1982.44,1986.44," I mean, you're going to have like a bunch of water down shit in order to give that much away."
1986.44,1989.44, It's got to be like a bunch of water down bullshit.
1989.44,1993.44," No, that's been through for a while."
1993.44,1996.44," Like the champions, the champion series."
1996.44,1997.44, Yeah.
1997.44,1999.44, That was that that game's problem.
1999.44,2002.44," It was a hack and slash, but none of the stuff was any good."
2002.44,2006.44, So you'd get a lot of it and even have any purpose for the money.
2006.44,2007.44, You just sell most of it.
2007.44,2008.44, Yeah.
2008.44,2010.44, And but there's there are just no good loot.
2010.44,2011.44, You don't have anything to buy.
2011.44,2012.44, Yeah.
2012.44,2015.44," That's the game recently where oh, it's the cone and older champion."
2015.44,2016.44, Yeah.
2016.44,2017.44, It's Conan isn't it?
2017.44,2020.44, The game I'm thinking about where there's a shit littered all over the streets.
2020.44,2023.44, The people who can get loot monsters in the show.
2023.44,2024.44, Yeah.
2024.44,2025.44, Right.
2025.44,2026.44, You don't want most of it.
2026.44,2028.44, That's the same inventory box.
2028.44,2029.44, Right.
2029.44,2032.44, So you just are walking in the street and there's imagine it's in real life.
2032.44,2035.44, And you're walking in the street and there's like 200 swords on the street.
2035.44,2036.44, That's how we were doing.
2036.44,2037.44, We were doing a fuck this shit.
2037.44,2038.44, Right.
2038.44,2039.44, Right.
2039.44,2040.44, I can't even get one top of it.
2040.44,2041.44, Animal crossing too.
2041.44,2043.44," Oh, it's better to have a to you."
2043.44,2044.44, Right.
2044.44,2046.44, You go because you run out of room in your house.
2046.44,2047.44, Go out in front.
2047.44,2049.44, You just dump all the crap in front of her.
2049.44,2052.44, And then then the game just turns into inventory management.
2052.44,2055.44, Because you feel like otherwise you're like littering the animal cross.
2055.44,2056.44, Yeah.
2056.44,2057.44, Yeah.
2057.44,2058.44, So we're any of you at Nintendo.
2058.44,2059.44, Yeah.
2059.44,2060.44, I was.
2060.44,2063.44, Because so are you a why do I think you're an animal crossing fan Ryan?
2063.44,2065.44, I have no idea of but I'm not.
2065.44,2066.44, I wish I am.
2066.44,2067.44, I like it.
2067.44,2069.44, Why didn't you put that on right?
2069.44,2070.44, You know.
2070.44,2071.44, I don't know.
2071.44,2072.44, No.
2072.44,2073.44, I'm sorry.
2073.44,2077.44, Those were games that I played for five minutes and then realize that I never need to
2077.44,2078.44, plan again.
2078.44,2082.44, I would think that you're in an animal tenderness would go into that game.
2083.44,2087.44, There's no you're not building toward anything.
2087.44,2089.44, That's kind of true.
2089.44,2090.44, Yeah.
2090.44,2091.44," Well, there's a game."
2091.44,2093.44, It's like all there is is existent.
2093.44,2096.44, There's not like tangible numbers.
2096.44,2097.44, You know.
2097.44,2098.44, Maybe Ryan.
2098.44,2099.44, I don't know why.
2099.44,2101.44, I'm just getting to know all you piece you guys.
2101.44,2105.44," And for some reason, you know, I know that Ryan has like a dark console side."
2105.44,2108.44, So I thought maybe in there was was animal.
2108.44,2109.44, I like a console side.
2109.44,2110.44, Did you see the.
2110.44,2111.44, I know.
2111.44,2113.44, Because I.
2113.44,2115.44," Oh, you know what?"
2115.44,2120.44," I wish Sean had been there because at the same time, the announced this animal crossing"
2120.44,2121.44, game for the Wii.
2121.44,2126.44, They announced basically the Wii equivalent of the Xbox live headset.
2126.44,2130.44, And it's like it's a microphone that you put on top of your TV.
2130.44,2132.44, They're like everybody can talk into.
2132.44,2133.44," Oh, so that mom."
2133.44,2136.44," Well, you're like if there's like a pedoresc to come through that way."
2136.44,2137.44, Yeah.
2137.44,2138.44, Yeah.
2138.44,2143.44, And you showed like it's been the tentos.
2143.44,2144.44, Big legitimate worry.
2144.44,2145.44, Yeah.
2145.44,2147.44, That's what it's like.
2147.44,2149.44, System's online is because they know that's like.
2149.44,2150.44, I don't know.
2150.44,2154.44," I mean, it's like inviting the strangers into the playpan and McDonald's."
2154.44,2155.44, I don't know.
2155.44,2156.44, And then.
2156.44,2157.44, And at the.
2157.44,2158.44, And at the.
2158.44,2164.44, Because you can also put your me face on the on the animal crossing character in the game.
2164.44,2166.44," Oh, which looks really creepy."
2166.44,2171.44," Yeah, that sounds so like it's especially because the skin colors, the skin tons will be different."
2171.44,2175.44, So you're sitting there fishing in this creepy looking animal crossing person with a me.
2175.44,2176.44," Oh, yeah."
2176.44,2177.44, That's a.
2177.44,2178.44, That's like.
2178.44,2181.44, I thought you were going to say like the fact that you can have your own face on it.
2181.44,2184.44, It's like one one Ryan in fourth grade used to wear the shirt.
2184.44,2185.44, This is grandma loves Ryan.
2185.44,2186.44, You don't.
2186.44,2188.44, They did a stranger came up.
2188.44,2189.44," I was like, hey, Ryan."
2189.44,2190.44, Do you want some candy?
2190.44,2193.44," He's like, oh, this guy knows my name."
2194.44,2195.44, He's candy.
2195.44,2197.44, How do you know?
2197.44,2199.44, They're telling me.
2199.44,2203.44, I don't want to further pollute your GFW podcast.
2203.44,2204.44, Talk of animal cross.
2204.44,2205.44, That's okay.
2205.44,2207.44," We move on, but we we talk."
2207.44,2209.44, I just I just was.
2209.44,2216.44," You know, I was disappointed to see that animal crossing looks exactly the same."
2216.44,2221.44," They added a city, you know, so the city looks tiny and like there's three things to do in it."
2221.44,2222.44, Yeah.
2222.44,2228.44," But the town and and the house and the activities, they're just all the same."
2228.44,2235.44," And they're so crazy because I mean, I don't know the kids that they're marketing this thing for are already playing"
2235.44,2244.44, Hobo hotel and all these other like cheap ass free games that let you do a billion times the things that reminds me of like in the air when people were still like playing fantasy star.
2244.44,2250.44, You know how there's multiple iterations in the Xbox one came out and like Shane and CJ were all loving it.
2250.44,2252.44," And I was like, you guys are crazy."
2252.44,2255.44, Like have you never tried a single like PC RPG.
2255.44,2258.44," You know, like this this is the fucking stone age."
2258.44,2260.44, And that's like animal crossing.
2260.44,2263.44, These kids like not even us sophisticated like like.
2263.44,2265.44, Like the animal crossing you can't do this.
2265.44,2273.44," One of the things you get to do is like they had they showed people sort of making up their own fishing game because you know, a fishing is an activity."
2273.44,2279.44," So it was like, okay, let's say I got my forefronts over and we're going to have a contest for who can catch the best fish."
2279.44,2282.44, It's just fucking sad like it's a video game.
2282.44,2283.44, It's a computer.
2283.44,2285.44, It's a computer design the game.
2285.44,2288.44, So that I don't have to make it up with my friends.
2288.44,2294.44," Yeah, yeah, that well that argument comes up a lot when you know when you came to out per say you know."
2294.44,2298.44," Well, and so we're putting the tools in the hands of the gamers like,"
2298.44,2300.44," No, actually, you know, we paid you 60 bucks."
2300.44,2302.44, We'd like a better few use your tools.
2302.44,2303.44, Yeah.
2303.44,2306.44, We want to play your game.
2306.44,2309.44, Not make your game.
2309.44,2310.44, I don't know.
2310.44,2311.44, Do we see other goods?
2311.44,2312.44, Good kid today.
2312.44,2316.44," Plenty of good stuff like yeah, for I wanted to kind of talk about resin."
2316.44,2318.44, You will five because I was so excited to learn.
2318.44,2321.44, I just got into town last night so I missed the press conference with the announced.
2321.44,2322.44, Is it still?
2322.44,2325.44, It is just as just get that it has online co-op.
2325.44,2332.44," Yeah, after I played it and for some reason, like, you know, Jason now in the PR guy didn't like I I honestly I hadn't heard anything about this press."
2332.44,2338.44," He's been playing the whole time and the way that it works, you know, you have a show of the assistant, you know, character working with you."
2338.44,2340.44," And I was like, oh, God, like, please tell me you're doing co-op."
2340.44,2341.44," He's like, oh, yeah, you know, we're doing co-op."
2341.44,2343.44," And I was like, what?"
2343.44,2348.44," Because it, like, the whole time you're playing, if you imagine everything you were doing with the ads, like,"
2348.44,2353.44," going to be so awesome with another player, just the way that the levels are designed."
2353.44,2357.44," Kind of the usual tricks that they use in gears of war and stuff were like, you know,"
2357.44,2360.44, the path is going to branch.
2360.44,2363.44," You're going to want to like, defend, help your guy out on the other side."
2363.44,2368.44," That sort of thing, but just with the mechanics and the pacing of Resident Evil, I think are going to work so well."
2368.44,2371.44, And then also I just loved the notion of a body system for scary games.
2371.44,2374.44," It just works, works right."
2374.44,2378.44," And I was happy to hear him announce that too, because I do, I maintain that like,"
2378.44,2382.44, Here's a war bar out so many things from Resident Evil 4.
2382.44,2386.44," You know, not limited to the chainsaw fadehound, these things like that."
2386.44,2392.44," But I mean, the camera, some of the specific bosses like the zirkers are like immediate direct adaptations from some of the,"
2392.44,2397.44," some of the blind enemies in Resident Evil 4, but then it's cool to see Capcom taking back,"
2397.44,2403.44," even though it's not like, you're as warm-vented, co-op, you know, but still see like, hey, this is a kind of a similar game again,"
2403.44,2405.44," if they, if no excuse not to do this."
2405.44,2407.44, But that game was awesome.
2407.44,2410.44," I mean, it almost be fair to compare it to like,"
2410.44,2414.44," we're one of our interns, we're about camped with an yourup,"
2414.44,2418.44, and you need to walk around with easily all our family members.
2418.44,2422.44, We're about to end with an extremely really big winner.
2422.44,2425.44," We're just going to be happy to go back to play this game forever,"
2425.44,2427.44, make sure to keep playing at 5 to 7 of them.
2427.44,2431.44," So John your mother-on-house is easy to answer,"
2431.44,2433.44," but you'd say, well, all of this game here's another game."
2433.44,2434.42, Huh?
2434.42,2435.42, Yeah.
2435.42,2436.42, You Wally boom.
2436.42,2437.42, What about friends of the Dark White Network?
2437.42,2438.44," The Dark White Network is an option based on you and all those people this man's career,"
2438.44,2440.44, I tried to save you.
2440.44,2443.08," I did, I mean, I was dying, but I still had fun."
2443.08,2445.44, So do you guys have to write a ball of easing?
2445.44,2446.44, Yes.
2446.44,2449.2400000000002," Wow, so I have relatively little work."
2449.2400000000002,2451.56," All right, so, you know."
2451.56,2453.92, I said Dragon Age.
2453.92,2454.92, Or Agents.
2454.92,2455.92, Did you see it too?
2455.92,2456.92, I didn't see Dragon Age.
2456.92,2457.92, Tell us about it.
2457.92,2465.4," Um, Dragon Age looks kind of, it's hard not to think of Lord of the Rings"
2465.4,2466.92," when you're watching it, you know?"
2466.92,2468.7200000000003," Wait, did they show that battle trailer again?"
2468.7200000000003,2473.7200000000003," They showed, um, they showed the lead, the level that leads up to that battle."
2473.7200000000003,2484.34," So, um, and you're in a wall high city trying to light a beacon, well, along blonde"
2484.34,2488.2400000000002," haired, um, guy goes, Ocho's."
2488.2400000000002,2491.56," And, you know, so I'll check back how to be a squeegee tech video."
2491.56,2495.12," Um, yeah, well, like, works and gollins attack."
2495.12,2496.84," Um, so,"
2496.88,2500.36," once you get past that, though, it looks, it looks really awesome, really excited about"
2500.36,2501.36, it.
2501.36,2504.36," But, I mean, it graphically, it looks nice."
2504.36,2506.36," Um, okay, wait, does."
2506.36,2507.36, I'm getting distracted.
2507.36,2509.36, We got the loud people again.
2509.36,2512.6800000000003," Um, tell us about those orcs."
2512.6800000000003,2515.88," From the trailer, it looked exactly like Lord of the Rings."
2515.88,2517.6800000000003," Yeah, well, yeah, well, everybody's saying this."
2517.6800000000003,2518.6800000000003," So, the trailer did."
2518.6800000000003,2519.6800000000003," So, it did."
2519.6800000000003,2520.6800000000003," So, it did."
2520.6800000000003,2521.6800000000003, It did.
2521.6800000000003,2525.1200000000003," See, there's a thing, I was, I was asking the tough questions in my interview with Greg's"
2525.12,2530.7," desk from By Wear, um, because I felt like I saw a little bit of graphical"
2530.7,2533.64, stuttering in like the trailer and then a little bit in the demo.
2533.64,2538.2799999999997," And I think I offended him because he was like, well, still being optimized."
2538.2799999999997,2541.44," You know, I mean, developers, I think we're seeing this all red."
2541.44,2545.6," You saw it with Mirrors Edge or with Randy Pitchford, like, they're very close to the"
2545.6,2546.6, project.
2546.6,2547.6, They're very sensitive about it.
2547.6,2549.88," And obviously, like, we're seeing unfinished software."
2549.88,2551.24," So, some of it, we have to filter through."
2551.24,2554.88, But I haven't feel like it's my job to just ask to see if there's any.
2555.36,2556.36, I think else there.
2556.36,2558.2000000000003," Um, it's kind of, I don't know, though."
2558.2000000000003,2561.7200000000003, I think that I kind of believed that those questions are largely pointless because it's
2561.7200000000003,2563.4," like, how else are they going to answer it?"
2563.4,2564.4, I guess.
2564.4,2565.4," They're never going to say, you know what?"
2565.4,2566.4," Yeah, believe me."
2566.4,2567.4, I felt that way.
2567.4,2568.4, It's going to be like in the game.
2568.4,2569.4, Fuck.
2569.4,2572.92," We got two years to go, but why not optimizing it?"
2572.92,2573.92, Fuck you.
2573.92,2575.7200000000003," I mean, yeah, there's the thing that it's like, they have enough time."
2575.7200000000003,2579.4," It's like, you should just assume that they assume that you're assuming that, you know,"
2579.4,2580.88," they, you have the goodwill to think the same."
2580.88,2584.0," But it's like, if it really comes down to it, are they going to say, even though"
2584.0,2587.36," they're head, they're like, fuck, our program or guys have been sweating over that one"
2587.36,2589.28," for six months, they still can't fix it."
2589.28,2590.28," Well, sorry."
2590.28,2594.8," Anyway, the point is despite that I was, I was being picky."
2594.8,2598.4," I guess that's what I felt bad about later was like, I was being picky."
2598.4,2600.44, So because it looked awesome.
2600.44,2601.28, I thought it looked great.
2601.28,2603.52, And the combat looked really fun.
2603.52,2604.8, And it's very tactical.
2604.8,2608.92, It's very much like Baldur's Gate 2 where you know your characters have little circles
2608.92,2609.92, under them.
2609.92,2610.92, And you pick them though.
2610.92,2613.92, I guess you can like break up your party a little bit and have some of your party
2613.92,2614.92, in one room.
2614.92,2618.48," So can you, you can go all the way out to an isometric perspective right?"
2618.48,2624.0," Yeah, you can, you can zoom in, you can pause the action, you can pull back."
2624.0,2626.8," And you know, it's all about combos of attacks."
2626.8,2631.8, And we saw some really great like magical spells.
2631.8,2637.32, And some big ominous enemies and big battles.
2637.32,2640.44," So I thought it was, I thought it was pretty exciting."
2640.44,2641.44, But yeah.
2641.44,2644.64, I guess it's like a simple as an RPG much in this environment.
2644.64,2647.0, I don't understand what you mean.
2647.0,2651.04," Well, I mean, say for example, you could look in and it would be fairly easy to demonstrate"
2651.04,2652.88, what the combat's like in the game.
2652.88,2654.8," But I mean, it's such a long game like that."
2654.8,2658.04," I mean, imagine in 10 minutes showing someone what Mass Effect is."
2658.04,2661.52," Oh, you know, I mean, it's just so much more difficult to give you a sense of, you know,"
2661.52,2664.2000000000003, where you can play five minutes of Pac-Man and you know what you know what you're
2664.2000000000003,2665.2000000000003, in for.
2665.2000000000003,2666.2000000000003," I mean, in RPG, you seem like you're just a..."
2666.2000000000003,2671.4," I guess since they're so clearly describing it as a return to their roots, we saw"
2671.48,2675.88," you know, we saw a corpse being looted with like new gear being put on and stuff."
2675.88,2681.88," We saw, I mean, we didn't see the leveling or the character creation system, which is one of the,"
2681.88,2684.08," I mean, it's not an ordinary management quest."
2684.08,2684.92, The origins.
2684.92,2691.32," I mean, we saw some conversations and things, but I guess the origin thing where you pick"
2691.32,2697.8, certain beginning for your character and choices you make during that time develop your character
2697.88,2703.28, into what it will be later in the game and actions that you'll be able to do in story points
2703.28,2704.92, that will happen later.
2704.92,2713.32," We didn't actually get to see that, but I mean, I felt like the RPG roots of it are pretty"
2713.32,2714.32, clear.
2714.32,2721.2400000000002," I think it's just exciting and general that they're doing it, that they seem committed to it."
2721.2400000000002,2723.0," Now, it seems to be their big new game."
2723.0,2726.6400000000003, It's the only thing that they're pimping here at E3 and they went out of their way at the
2726.64,2731.8399999999997," EA press conference to say, you know, this is, this is our new PC franchise and like you"
2731.8399999999997,2733.24," said, and this spiritual stuff."
2733.24,2734.24, They have elders gate.
2734.24,2740.68," They know they said also was going to be on the 360 later, but they made it, or they"
2740.68,2743.64," said in the future, you made a point of saying in the future, but I thought it was funny"
2743.64,2747.7599999999998," to read online pink saying, I ca ha, PC guys, it's on both now."
2747.7599999999998,2750.4," When I actually thought it was the opposite, it was sort of like ha ha."
2750.4,2751.72, We get it first.
2751.7999999999997,2757.12," No, I, that's not the point, I don't mean like to get into the controversy PC,"
2757.12,2762.7999999999997," where, but what I just mean is that the fact that by or at this point in the game doesn't"
2762.7999999999997,2765.52, necessarily have to make another PC game.
2765.52,2769.72," They don't, they could just go for the bigger fish all the time and they're choosing"
2769.72,2772.8399999999997, with their resources and their time to make it that a kid at PC game.
2772.8399999999997,2774.7599999999998, I'm great that it's being ported later.
2774.7599999999998,2775.6, Everybody should play it.
2775.6,2776.6, That's fine.
2776.6,2779.64, But I'm happy that they're choosing to go PC first.
2779.8799999999997,2783.3199999999997," I have to print this out later, but I had to hear the web from our forums and I was"
2783.3199999999997,2787.56, a reaction to Final Fantasy XIII being Xbox 360.
2787.56,2788.56, Yeah.
2788.56,2789.56, But it's the same kind of mentality.
2789.56,2792.8799999999997," When you're saying I'm just like, shake my head at the whole way that this works."
2792.8799999999997,2797.56," But this guy was like saying, you know, if you know, when you think about Japan, he's like,"
2797.56,2802.2," an I'm an expert, like you know the honors really important."
2802.2,2803.2, And I'm going to tell you.
2803.2,2808.56," This wasn't just you, but it's not that bad or like, yeah, it could have been the"
2808.56,2811.7599999999998, kind of shit I would say like what I'm playing team Fortress 2 or something.
2811.7599999999998,2814.16, And like it would be that video called honor.
2814.16,2817.52," And if you're just saying like, you know, they basically need to fall on their own sword"
2817.52,2821.08, for their fans because they're releasing this game on 360 as well.
2821.08,2822.48, A lot of PS3.
2822.48,2828.04," But so then there's other threads and the titles are just like, there is no God confirmed."
2828.04,2831.12," You know, and this is because this game has come out on."
2831.12,2833.44, This was why I woke up sick.
2833.44,2836.96," I woke up sick yesterday morning and I thought I just got to enlistening to, you know, my"
2836.96,2839.0," alarm clock is like, you know, the, not talk radio."
2839.0,2840.0, It's like NPR and stuff.
2840.0,2844.28," And they're talking about, you know, what's happening with fanomé and Freddie Mac, I mean,"
2844.28,2848.76," just the dire state of our economy, the ongoing, you know, developments in housing crisis."
2848.76,2852.68, So I turned on my computer and I look and like I see this thread.
2852.68,2857.28," And I was like, there's like a billion, you know, there's a billion stories and, you know,"
2857.28,2860.04," like 5,000 sites all talking about this stuff."
2860.04,2862.84," And then you look in this thread and there's just like, at least like three word responses"
2862.84,2864.28, about there's no God because of this.
2865.28,2866.0800000000004," I was like, do you know what?"
2866.0800000000004,2868.6000000000004," Well, I was talking about this fucking thread."
2868.6000000000004,2871.28," I will tell you, you're a group of no God, Sean."
2872.0,2873.0, And this is for real.
2873.7200000000003,2875.92," No, no multiplayer and Dragon Age."
2877.0,2877.44, What?
2877.7200000000003,2878.6400000000003, No multiplayer.
2878.6400000000003,2880.0, It's a single player game.
2880.6000000000004,2881.0400000000004, Wow.
2881.4,2883.36," Which, I mean, what's it?"
2883.44,2886.2000000000003," It was like, it broke my heart in the interview."
2886.2000000000003,2887.1200000000003, I'm serious.
2887.1200000000003,2889.6800000000003," I'm not, I'm not using hyperbole here."
2889.6800000000003,2894.2400000000002," I was really upset because like anybody who was listening to me,"
2894.28,2900.76," on podcasts, the floor knows that I'm really into land, cooperative RPGs."
2900.76,2903.6400000000003," Yeah, but high, bothers hate one and two, no multiplayer."
2903.84,2904.96, Balls are gay too.
2905.48,2905.96, Huh?
2905.96,2906.8, Dark alliance?
2907.1200000000003,2908.52," No, but gay too."
2909.4,2910.32, Didn't have multiplayer.
2910.32,2911.5600000000004, You can play a multiplayer.
2912.0400000000004,2913.32, You can play it in land.
2914.52,2915.1600000000003," Oh, boy."
2915.76,2917.8," We need, we need someone with a better memory than me."
2917.8,2918.5600000000004, We need a fact check.
2918.5600000000004,2919.96," No, I've played a fan."
2920.36,2921.2400000000002," Facts, checker."
2922.36,2923.2400000000002," Well, it would help."
2923.56,2926.72," I mean, like, I'm definitely not going to complain about some playing games."
2926.72,2927.7999999999997, It's like a believing.
2928.3199999999997,2928.7999999999997, It was fine.
2928.7999999999997,2929.68, A single player fallout.
2929.68,2931.16, It was just looked at a single player.
2931.2799999999997,2931.64, Yeah.
2932.2799999999997,2933.72," Not, you know, the biggest concern."
2934.2799999999997,2937.72, But I absolutely like it in risen.
2937.72,2938.8799999999997, You will find the thing that we're there.
2938.8799999999997,2940.52, You played ballders gate to in land.
2941.0,2943.08," It's totally, I don't believe that you can."
2943.08,2945.4799999999996, I remember being just like a party based D&D game.
2945.4799999999996,2947.2," I can't, how would you even do that?"
2948.9199999999996,2951.7599999999998," You broke up your computers and, oh, yeah."
2952.7200000000003,2955.7200000000003," I'm like, I'm now you're like making me question my"
2957.44,2958.7200000000003, That's a valid memory.
2958.7200000000003,2959.7200000000003, I think skip so.
2959.7200000000003,2960.4," Skip, that skip."
2960.4,2962.32, Googly and Rermirming time here while skip.
2963.2000000000003,2964.28, A fact checker.
2965.5600000000004,2966.6400000000003," Andrews, get faster."
2967.5600000000004,2969.28," Okay, lightning fingers, faster."
2969.5200000000004,2970.28, It means time.
2970.28,2973.0400000000004, You know what I saw today that it's coming to PC.
2973.1200000000003,2975.0," Yeah, what street fighter for?"
2975.1600000000003,2976.4, That just played some really.
2977.2000000000003,2977.6800000000003," Yeah, did he?"
2977.6800000000003,2979.1200000000003, That seems like a office.
2979.1200000000003,2979.5200000000004, That's a hard.
2979.5200000000004,2980.0, Your new main.
2980.0,2980.36, Huh?
2980.5600000000004,2980.92, What?
2980.92,2981.92, Rufus is your new main.
2981.92,2982.92, See the fat one?
2982.92,2983.92, Yeah.
2983.92,2984.92, It's a goldish game.
2984.92,2987.92, It's a fight that has to be trailed dirty happy trail coming up
2987.92,2988.92, Is pot belly.
2989.92,2992.12," It's not like still, oh, Japan."
2992.12,2992.92, They love America.
2993.92,2994.92, Like that's an American character.
2995.92,2997.92," Okay, do you guys think that guy?"
2997.92,2999.92," Yeah, sure we got some games to hook them up back."
2999.92,3000.92, Go kung fu chaos.
3000.92,3002.92," They're still, they still almost a couple."
3002.92,3003.92," Yeah, they did."
3003.92,3004.92, They did.
3004.92,3005.92, We can't complain about that.
3005.92,3006.92, What?
3006.92,3007.92, What?
3007.92,3008.92, Did I plan?
3008.92,3009.92," Oh, Jen's right."
3009.92,3010.92, I'm all insulted.
3010.92,3011.92, That's okay.
3011.92,3012.92, Okay.
3012.92,3013.92, How are we at the...
3013.92,3014.92, We don't at it.
3014.92,3015.92, We're not at it.
3015.92,3016.92, We don't at it.
3016.92,3017.92, It's like about street.
3017.92,3018.92, I was wrong.
3018.92,3019.92, There.
3019.92,3020.92, It's right.
3020.92,3023.92," But just let me just tell you it's really, really fun that way."
3023.92,3024.92, We also totally plan.
3024.92,3025.92, We'll get back to it.
3025.92,3026.92, I still plan.
3026.92,3027.92," I mean, we still plan."
3027.92,3028.92, It's a nice one.
3028.92,3029.92, Really?
3029.92,3030.92, Yeah.
3030.92,3031.92, Okay.
3031.92,3032.92," Well, nerd alert."
3032.92,3033.92, I probably didn't have a land background.
3033.92,3034.92, It's hard to set up.
3034.92,3036.92, I'm not saying it's easy.
3036.92,3037.92," I mean, it's difficult."
3037.92,3038.92, But.
3039.92,3040.92, Okay.
3040.92,3042.92, So I'm bummed that dragnages totally so clear.
3042.92,3044.92," Anyway, moving on to wherever we were."
3044.92,3045.92, I don't know where we're reshon.
3045.92,3046.92, Right.
3046.92,3047.92, Right.
3047.92,3048.92, Stree fighter.
3048.92,3049.92," Oh, yeah."
3049.92,3050.92, Really?
3050.92,3051.92, On the PC?
3051.92,3053.92," Well, they have like arcade cabinets set up."
3053.92,3056.92, I guess it releases an arcade's next week.
3056.92,3057.92, Okay.
3057.92,3060.92, But coming out on PC as well as consoles.
3060.92,3061.92, We start to with all of that.
3061.92,3062.92, I don't see the point of that.
3062.92,3064.92," Well, if you plug in your controller,"
3064.92,3066.92, same as your 360 controller.
3066.92,3067.92, Okay.
3067.92,3068.92," Oh, shit."
3068.92,3069.92," Oh, yeah."
3069.92,3070.92, Hold on.
3070.92,3071.92, Sean's getting a phone call.
3071.92,3072.92, Let's put this on here.
3072.92,3073.92, All right.
3073.92,3075.92, I can't stop.
3075.92,3076.92, So what about it?
3076.92,3078.92," What are you liking about it, right?"
3078.92,3080.92, Stree fighter.
3080.92,3081.92, It's awesome.
3081.92,3082.92," No, it."
3082.92,3083.92, Thanks for the insight.
3083.92,3084.92, Yeah.
3084.92,3085.92, Yeah.
3085.92,3086.92, That's what that's one of your fours.
3086.92,3092.92," Well, Stree fighter too, you know, that was sort of like."
3092.92,3095.92, People are still playing Stree fighter too today.
3095.92,3097.92," Super shie fighter, too turbo."
3097.92,3102.92," And it's been like, I don't think there's been like a 2D fighter since then."
3102.92,3106.92, It's still sort of in the public.
3106.92,3107.92, I.
3107.92,3109.92, That's because we've all moved on to.
3109.92,3110.92," Well, no, hey."
3110.92,3111.92, It's territory though.
3111.92,3114.92," I mean, because like, yeah, it's like sure in the public guy."
3114.92,3117.92, But it's like Mortal Kombat 2 is very huge in the public guy.
3117.92,3119.92, Much more so than Stree fighter 3-3-3 strike.
3119.92,3122.92, And Stree fighter 3 wasn't the next one game.
3122.92,3123.92, Right.
3123.92,3127.92," And Stree fighter 3, like that was a game that was basically designed."
3127.92,3132.92," They catered specifically to the hardcore crowd, like with the pairing system and all that."
3132.92,3135.92," And Stree fighter 4 at least, at least in my limited time with it."
3135.92,3136.92, It feels like it's.
3136.92,3138.92, It's a lot more accessible.
3138.92,3141.92, Can it be that it was all so simple there.
3141.92,3142.92, Yeah.
3142.92,3144.92, There you go.
3144.92,3146.92," I'm sticking to your chorus, man."
3146.92,3147.92, Yeah.
3147.92,3149.92, So Stree fighter 4 seems like a.
3149.92,3151.92, It's pretty cool.
3152.92,3156.92, Yeah. It's kind of through me because it was so much like it's so much more like two.
3156.92,3157.92, Right.
3157.92,3158.92, than anything.
3158.92,3159.92, It came afterward.
3159.92,3162.92," I mean, even the Alpha series, you know, like just not being able to block it in the air and stuff."
3162.92,3164.92," It was like, it was fun."
3164.92,3167.92," I don't know though about, I mean, I think it's fun."
3167.92,3168.92, I think it's cool.
3168.92,3171.92," But it didn't, I think I like so caliber 4 a lot more so far."
3171.92,3176.92," I know this is comparing games of, of the same genre."
3176.92,3178.92, Excuse me for it.
3178.92,3179.92, How fun.
3179.92,3180.92, Fans are though.
3180.92,3181.92," Oh, my god."
3181.92,3182.92, You can't.
3182.92,3185.92," Once got weapons and once and 3D with that, I don't know."
3185.92,3186.92, But it's not in 3D.
3186.92,3188.92, Sean Elliott retard confirmed.
3188.92,3189.92, Yeah.
3189.92,3190.92, Yeah.
3190.92,3191.92, There goes.
3191.92,3192.92, Fuck that.
3192.92,3193.92, I'm tired of hearing that stuff.
3193.92,3195.92," This was, I got to bring this up because before we were taping, you know,"
3195.92,3202.92, I always make fun of like when you see like an internet threat or something and the whole thing is loaded with those catch phrases.
3202.92,3203.92, Yeah.
3203.92,3204.92, Yeah.
3204.92,3205.92, He catch phrases.
3205.92,3206.92," Oh, no."
3206.92,3207.92, It might be that I translate that.
3207.92,3208.92, It kind of knows.
3208.92,3209.92, Yeah.
3209.92,3219.92," So like again, you know, as a manager in 10 years ago, people were doing this and it would sound pretty much like a pity the food turtle power."
3219.92,3222.92, But it's a void annoyed.
3222.92,3224.92, Where's the beef?
3224.92,3225.92, Show me the money.
3225.92,3227.92, It's all good.
3227.92,3229.92, I saw more recent.
3229.92,3233.92, I banned the random pluralizing in my house.
3233.92,3238.92," Like, like, started with internet and moved on to every other word."
3238.92,3239.92, Really?
3239.92,3240.92," Well, what's this here?"
3240.92,3243.92, I decided I'm officially too old for that shit.
3243.92,3244.92, Yeah.
3244.92,3245.92," You're saying it's here, hubby."
3245.92,3246.92, Yeah.
3246.92,3250.92," And people I talked to a lot at work and I was like, where's the dinners?"
3250.92,3251.92, It's something like that.
3251.92,3253.92, That's seen the law cat.
3253.92,3254.92, So Maddie.
3254.92,3255.92, All cats I'm okay with.
3255.92,3257.92," Well, random pluralizing now."
3257.92,3259.92, Imagine your husband going around how's going tricks.
3259.92,3260.92, You're not.
3260.92,3262.92, And like stuff like that.
3262.92,3264.92, That's pretty much what it is.
3264.92,3266.92, Just if you ever hear it go.
3267.92,3268.92, No.
3268.92,3271.92, I don't speak your an Anthony's word twin language.
3271.92,3273.92, That's just a punishment event.
3273.92,3276.92," Whenever someone says I'm stupid, which happens all the time."
3276.92,3277.92, Myself included.
3277.92,3278.92, But that's how we punish each other.
3278.92,3279.92, What the fake laugh.
3279.92,3281.92, Just do that laugh and everyone knows.
3281.92,3285.92," Just like, man, she'd know my mouthing and saying,"
3285.92,3287.92," Steve, chill like that."
3287.92,3290.92," Fucking sorry, guys."
3290.92,3293.92," So yes, what do anything else about Street Fighter?"
3293.92,3295.92," I mean, that new character, Rufus."
3295.92,3298.92, He's like just a big giant ball.
3298.92,3300.92, Imagine like an aesthetic ball with feet.
3300.92,3301.92, It's arms on.
3301.92,3304.92," And then the ball, the ball, the composing his torso."
3304.92,3308.92, Just kind of like wiggles and jiggles the whole time.
3308.92,3311.92, I heard he was created as a tribute to George clown.
3311.92,3312.92, Really?
3312.92,3313.92, What?
3313.92,3316.92," I was all, but I was getting all missed."
3316.92,3318.92, He's like as super George.
3318.92,3319.92, Super jumpsuit.
3319.92,3322.92, It's zipped like all the way down to his like pubis.
3322.92,3324.92, And there's like a happy trail coming up out.
3324.92,3327.92, That's just that word.
3327.92,3328.92, That's just a good word.
3328.92,3329.92, You best use this.
3329.92,3331.92, That's a guaranteed laugh line.
3331.92,3333.92, It's where you get to wear a tube of something.
3333.92,3334.92, You get to wear a tube of something.
3334.92,3336.92, You just mount right on this gag.
3336.92,3338.92, It's got a tattoo of it.
3338.92,3339.92, No.
3339.92,3342.92," Yeah, so it's, it seems pretty cool."
3342.92,3345.92, It seems like a fun game.
3345.92,3347.92, I'm trying to think if there were any other big things.
3347.92,3348.92, Thought it were too.
3348.92,3349.92, Thought it were too.
3349.92,3350.92, Thought it were too.
3350.92,3351.92, I thought it was good.
3351.92,3354.92," Well, I mentioned to them in the, in the little demo we had."
3354.92,3357.92, I thought it was very interesting that they're kind of going in.
3357.92,3359.92, I want to say boldly direction.
3359.92,3362.92," I mean, it's still on RTS on the PC."
3362.92,3368.92, But they're breaking away from the formula that was Donna 401 with some interesting.
3368.92,3370.92," Yeah, considering the changes."
3370.92,3373.92," If you compare this to not the company here, it's been to Donna 401."
3373.92,3375.92," Yeah, I think they're really substantial difference."
3375.92,3376.92," Yeah, they are."
3376.92,3380.92," I mean, and you know, we know that gamers are much more conservative than they like to think they are."
3380.92,3387.92," You know, when it comes to changing their games, you know, they all want changed, but then actually it turns out they don't like you and E3."
3387.92,3389.92," Yeah, well, fuck you."
3389.92,3391.92," Yeah, you're right."
3391.92,3392.92, That's okay.
3392.92,3396.92," Oh, boy."
3396.92,3403.92," Does this game, is there something that could, could this conceivably kind of replace company of heroes?"
3403.92,3405.92," Ah, where's this?"
3405.92,3406.92," Oh, it's on track."
3407.92,3411.92," It's, I think it's probably still on a soundtrack probably mostly just because of the setting."
3411.92,3413.92," It was placed it for me, probably."
3413.92,3416.92, That they took some of company heroes ideas.
3416.92,3417.92, That's for sure.
3417.92,3418.92, Right.
3418.92,3424.92," It's kind of like, I mean, it's just like a leapfrogging where there were a number of things that they came up with for Donna Ward that they ended up doing."
3424.92,3428.92, That they basically prototype her Donna Ward ended up implementing a company heroes.
3428.92,3429.92, Yeah.
3429.92,3432.92," And then likewise now, they're taking some of those ideas and bringing them over to this game."
3432.92,3438.92," I would say it would replace it just in the sense where like, you know, for me, company heroes continues to be the game that I play on a weekly basis."
3438.92,3443.92," And then if there's going to be that game where you're like, okay, this is the one I'm going to invest."
3443.92,3447.92," But it, pardon me, literally, you know, hundreds of hours playing."
3447.92,3450.92," Like it could, it to me, it has the the markings of it."
3450.92,3451.92, It's kind of interesting though.
3451.92,3454.92," There's like, there's so many people that are like, a company here doesn't want to play."
3454.92,3455.92, It's more that world war two shit.
3455.92,3460.92," And then there's like, for me, I'm getting used to the war hammer stuff for the most part of you guys look cool."
3460.92,3465.92," But like, they're parts that stretch for me, like when the the work vehicle comes out."
3465.92,3467.92, It's like a war boss truck.
3467.92,3470.92, That was the fucking pizza thrower from the TV community.
3470.92,3471.92, Just throw those five or so.
3471.92,3478.92," You know how, sometimes it look the difference between, you know, when you design a vehicle and real army designs a vehicle,"
3478.92,3480.92, took to win a battle with.
3480.92,3484.92, And then there's the kind of vehicle you design when you've got some oversized action figure.
3484.92,3489.92, And you got to figure out some fucking way to continue plastic to get that fucking thing in there.
3489.92,3494.92, And that's what the thing it looked like when it came out is like the works of broad shoulder.
3494.92,3496.92, They're not going to fit in the right part.
3496.92,3500.92, It's like open top baby all the way.
3500.92,3507.92, But that's part of the charm of that franchise show is like that they've embraced that kind of goofy thing.
3507.92,3512.92, And that's one thing I thought was a little on it in the Don of War two that we saw so far.
3512.92,3516.92, It's like it looked like they were making it a little I was going to ask them about this and they did.
3516.92,3521.92, They looked like they've made it a little more gritty and like sort of quote unquote realistic.
3521.92,3529.92," Then Don of War one was which was much more in the kind of like warcraft cartoony style which and yes,"
3529.92,3532.92, I don't say anyone to tell me the warhammer predated warcraft.
3532.92,3533.92, I know that.
3533.92,3539.92," All right. So I would say yeah, I think part of what you're noticing through those all the new, you know, animation that they're adding."
3539.92,3543.92," I can disagain as what I'm used to for company heroes, but like words and the original Don of War."
3543.92,3553.92," I mean, you can go in some Marion fight people are kind of just going to be doing things, but in this game, though, you can see if someone's under fire, they're going to react is that we're getting like a first person shooter or something."
3553.92,3557.92, You actually see the animations. They're going to take cover. They're going to use cover.
3557.92,3564.92," All those sorts of things just just translate that in the blood, just the higher detailing stuff makes it."
3564.92,3568.92," I mean, it's still yeah, it's it seems like the warhammer universe, if you had like a better engine."
3569.92,3574.92," Yeah, I guess so, but but the engine, but you get a better engine and not have it be more."
3574.92,3580.92," It probably is greater. I mean, if you've you've looked, they always send us those warhammer books, the ones that we've had to pay our free ones that we read out."
3580.92,3584.92," And they're, and they're full of just like, not really stuff, you know what I mean?"
3584.92,3587.92," Oh, yeah, they are. That's like the."
3587.92,3591.92," That's what a, yeah, put on the inside of your trench coat for reading material."
3591.92,3597.92, That was a crazy. That was a crazy six months of say if we got like a landfill full of warhammer.
3597.92,3603.92, That was unreal. So let's let's point a few before we joke too much about the gift. There's a few things that I learned today.
3603.92,3606.92, I want to point out that we didn't talk about what we talked about the last.
3606.92,3610.92," And that was like the, um, their solution for spawning in."
3610.92,3614.92, Since you're only ever really controlled four or five squads at a time.
3614.92,3617.92, And each of the squad leaders is this unit you're supposed to like identify with.
3617.92,3622.92," You're getting, you know, power up for them and things. This is again where they're borrowing from the Diablo thing."
3623.92,3629.92," And if that squad leader falls in the course of a battle, he doesn't die. You can go and revive him or her."
3629.92,3631.92, Where's like the squad members are dead.
3631.92,3636.92," And then you're able to, yes, so you're able to reinforce red shirts in two different ways."
3636.92,3643.92, And one is that like your force commander could have a power and you're able to talk about this and how you're able to slot these in.
3643.92,3650.92, And that would be like to pull the dropout down. So one dropout will fall from your spaceship and guys come out of it.
3650.92,3654.92," You can also smash enemies with it. Yeah, that was cool. I like that. That was a cool idea."
3654.92,3657.92," Yeah, I mean, that looked great. I mean, just like just watching it play."
3657.92,3663.92," I mean, it's entertaining for me. It's part of why like, you know, the way that artillery works and companies and stuff."
3663.92,3664.92, I just love to see it.
3664.92,3670.92, Relicats are really nice. They have a really nice tactile feel. They're really good with like sounds and things like that.
3670.92,3677.92," Yeah, when this drop pot drops from the sky with your four units, it doesn't just like, you know, this thing like crashes down onto the earth and the shape of the world."
3677.92,3682.92," Yeah, yeah, she takes a whole screen. Even if guys like 10 feet away, we'll be thrown into their feet."
3682.92,3687.92, Right. So you could actually crush your enemies with this thing. That's really just a spawn thing for new units.
3687.92,3691.92," It was neat. Yeah, I agree. They totally my effect to review the same."
3691.92,3697.92," Monolith is good about that, too. I think both of those companies are probably foremost in like getting that sense of impact to every new."
3697.92,3702.92," Yeah, it's really, yeah, you saw when they used the orbital laser for that bombardment. That was great."
3702.92,3713.92," It blows up in this. It's not. I mean, it's very getting away from the toy like feel of an RTS and just making it seem like the even a grenade, right? You'd saw them throw, like, yeah, it was called a melt the bomb is basically sticky bomb through it on the vehicle."
3713.92,3719.92, The vehicle blows up wheels go flying off the guys inside it like burning and kind of roll out from it from it.
3719.92,3725.92," The other way I was talking about reinforce and units is to like if you, this new system is that instead of just like capturing a flag,"
3725.92,3731.92, depending on the world you're in there might be like a building or a structure that's got some meaning in the larger narrative.
3731.92,3734.92, Like there's this shrine to some like holy space marine dude.
3734.92,3739.92," And you basically, you capture that, but in order to do it, it's kind of like this big set piece battle."
3739.92,3744.92," You're like, do I want to do this? You know what's going to be a challenge and you want to approach it with some, you know, four sides."
3744.92,3748.92," So, say, maybe, you know, I'm going to have a sniper ready here to take out their guard when I attack."
3748.92,3752.92, My jet jump pack guys are going to leap over the wall and get inside the attack.
3752.92,3758.92," I'm going to follow up with this, but then ultimately when you do take that, you'll, you'll be able to reinforce from that building."
3758.92,3762.92, But you'll also maintain it throughout your campaign as you're going to other planets and stuff.
3762.92,3768.92," You still technically hold that shrine and then it increases morale for your army and gives you a few other perks, but you might have to defend it too, right?"
3768.92,3771.92," Because they could give a time when the enemies like, well, we're trying to get this back."
3771.92,3777.92, Then you'd go and have to wage war defense at that same site in order to maintain it and the bonuses is providing you.
3777.92,3780.92," No, that was something else to show to that that was pretty cool."
3780.92,3782.92," Yeah, I like that a lot."
3782.92,3786.92, This is what I was scared of coming to the UW-Ready.
3786.92,3791.92," Well, I mean, it started out like not talking about it because I know you didn't run and like,"
3791.92,3797.92," No, it last time. I was like scared, but you made it a safe and comfortable place for me, Sean."
3797.92,3798.92, This time.
3798.92,3803.92, But see you took off the training wheels and you got to go with the gen.
3803.92,3805.92," Thank you, Mr. here. It gives you a hundred word."
3805.92,3807.92," You know, how are you feeling about Donuarturin?"
3807.92,3809.92, I have some of the Brian's or soda.
3809.92,3812.92," Please, that's my 12-word review."
3812.92,3816.92," So the other thing, okay, what a, it sounds neat."
3816.92,3818.92," You guys, I said it look neat."
3818.92,3820.92," In this case, I don't see how."
3820.92,3826.92," I think that they're borrowing wisely from the Diablo play mechanics, but I don't see them as like,"
3826.92,3828.92, bringing the baggage along with it.
3828.92,3833.92," And so far as it's not randomized levels, all the levels are really short to, which is interesting."
3833.92,3837.92," It's like, it's about how you're going to approach it from technically rather than going in and"
3837.92,3842.92," slogging through building up your army just to like, just have it turn in just some"
3842.92,3845.92," grueling war of a tradition at the very end where like, please just let this level end."
3845.92,3850.92," I mean, it seemed to be like, right? I mean, the level we saw, they basically played through levels like,"
3850.92,3851.92, I could do that right.
3851.92,3854.92," He said, he said it was going to be a lot of short missions."
3854.92,3857.92," A little, and I think that seems like a good decision."
3857.92,3858.92, I thought that was cool too.
3858.92,3863.92," And the other thing is like, you, all the stuff you're getting, it's not like every single guy you"
3863.92,3866.92," kill drops stuff, but someone does have a drop."
3866.92,3869.92," You're like, okay, I'm going to grab that and it's going to be cool, but you're not going"
3869.92,3870.92, to be able to use it.
3870.92,3873.92, It's not like you're going to pause the game right then and equip and see what it does.
3873.92,3876.92," But then when you go back after you complete the mission and you go back to your spaceship,"
3876.92,3881.92," and you're going to outfit your groups, you only have like so many slots that you can put stuff in."
3881.92,3884.92," So it's like, you have different weapons and armor and stuff, and then you also these power slots and"
3884.92,3890.92," you're going to use this ability that's like a marksman that lets me snipe, or that lets me draw"
3890.92,3895.92," and reinforcements or an orbital bombardment or like, how am I going to use this power and how"
3895.92,3897.92, is it going to mix with the other slots I have?
3897.92,3900.92," And anything that boardalands is better because there's like 500,000 of them."
3900.92,3903.92," There's a lot of, they said they're up to about 600,000."
3903.92,3907.92, Which is funny because technically all that he's adding a little texture and then suddenly
3907.92,3910.92," multiplying that by the 500,000 already had."
3910.92,3913.92," You've now got like, you know, we're talking like exponential."
3913.92,3918.92," Like by the time this game comes out, they're going to be like 3.6 trillion weapon."
3918.92,3920.92, It was so sad.
3920.92,3922.92, And every one of them is going to be great.
3922.92,3927.92," That's a nice scope and it's like you said another weapon, the scope one was like an X crosshair"
3927.92,3928.92, and the other was a triangle.
3928.92,3929.92, Right.
3929.92,3930.92, Degas notice they were doing that too.
3930.92,3933.92," It's like the, as he was going through the level, like they were commenting on like"
3933.92,3937.92," like they would like huge a guy and like and he'd go like, oh, do you see the way that"
3937.92,3938.92, guy fell?
3938.92,3939.92, Like they were talking to each other.
3939.92,3942.92, I felt bad for them because stop loving your own game.
3942.92,3945.92, And then that was so cool the way that guy fell.
3945.92,3947.92, Did they point out the water effects?
3947.92,3948.92, That they didn't.
3948.92,3951.92, And then the level that I called Morticai comes out.
3951.92,3955.92, And he's about as typical authority as you can find in a shooter.
3955.92,3956.92, Right.
3956.92,3958.92," I mean, this guy's fucking a Morticai."
3958.92,3960.92," He's just like, he's just Joe blow."
3960.92,3964.92," But he comes out and they're like, you get to have to wait to see what Morticai"
3964.92,3965.92, he likes down.
3965.92,3966.92, He jumps down.
3966.92,3968.92," And then they like, pause it like this."
3968.92,3969.92, It continued.
3969.92,3971.92, Like it that was like trying to suspense point.
3971.92,3973.92, It was like a TV TV trailer.
3973.92,3976.92," You know, like that would be the series that was never filmed."
3976.92,3978.92," Yeah, they're like, oh, we're going to have to stop it here guys."
3978.92,3980.92," They were like, okay."
3980.92,3982.92, You can't go down.
3982.92,3986.92," Sorry, Randy, if you had to be with us."
3986.92,3988.92, I would just give it to you.
3988.92,3992.92, It was just kind of funny and surreal to be.
3992.92,3997.92," I actually had the same experience at a sport demo, not at E3, but way back when they"
3997.92,4001.92," were at Maxis, it was that event where they had it divided up in the different stations."
4001.92,4004.92, So it was like five different stations representing the five different games.
4004.92,4006.92," It was, you know, the save game, whatever."
4006.92,4010.92," And there was a, they had one that was just creating the creature."
4010.92,4011.92," Yeah, that was it."
4011.92,4015.92," And at the stations, they had different guys demoing the different things."
4015.92,4016.92, And they were all nice.
4016.92,4018.92, So that's a nice dug fee.
4018.92,4019.92, Look at us.
4019.92,4021.92, Where there was a guy who was making it.
4021.92,4023.92, Look at the space time.
4023.92,4024.92, That's what it was.
4024.92,4025.92, It was like that.
4026.92,4028.92, But it was like guy who was making it in himself.
4028.92,4029.92, And he was just by himself.
4029.92,4030.92, He didn't have like a part.
4030.92,4031.92, It was like that.
4031.92,4032.92, So it was like he was sitting there.
4032.92,4035.92," And there were like three journals, you know, sitting there and he's like,"
4035.92,4037.92," he's like, okay, so he can give him these CDs."
4037.92,4039.92," Look, God, these feeders so cool."
4039.92,4042.92," You know, he was like so thrilled with himself as he was making it."
4042.92,4044.92," And like, haven't even been doing this all day."
4044.92,4046.92," And like, like for the last six months."
4046.92,4048.92," That's what he was like, he was demoing it for himself."
4048.92,4050.92, And he was pleased with the game.
4050.92,4053.92, So we leave you alone so you can enjoy this by yourself.
4053.92,4056.92," Because we they kicked you out if you're like,"
4056.92,4059.92," I mean, and it was cool."
4059.92,4060.92, And that's the thing.
4060.92,4061.92, Like there were things about boardal lands.
4061.92,4064.92, I like it was just sort of interesting that they were so into it themselves.
4064.92,4065.92, Right.
4065.92,4066.92, Who's they?
4066.92,4067.92, EA publishing boardal lands?
4067.92,4068.92," Yeah, two."
4068.92,4069.92, Okay.
4069.92,4070.92, They aren't random.
4070.92,4073.92, It's a good thing that they aren't randomizing the levels as far as I can tell.
4073.92,4078.92," But in the section they showed, it was like the AI wasn't especially impressive."
4078.92,4080.92, There just really wasn't anything not worthy.
4080.92,4082.92," It was like this game is going to get by and the strength of those 500,000."
4082.92,4086.92, And so that's kind of why we're making such a big deal of those gun.
4086.92,4090.92," However, when they showed the part when you're driving around, and we say we is because it's a cooperative game."
4090.92,4091.92, Yeah.
4091.92,4094.92," When they're driving out around in the badlands, that look pretty fun."
4094.92,4095.92," You know, you could run, you know, I didn't even know."
4095.92,4096.92, That's over and stuff.
4096.92,4098.92, And you could switch seats and the animation for that was great.
4098.92,4101.92," Like when you're both playing, you decide that was right now."
4101.92,4102.92, You don't have to stop the vehicle.
4102.92,4103.92, You both do.
4103.92,4104.92, Right.
4104.92,4105.92, It was like a once.
4105.92,4106.92, But switch to the switch.
4106.92,4107.92, You do some hazard boy maneuvers.
4107.92,4108.92, Right.
4108.92,4109.92, You watch some of the climb over the seats.
4109.92,4110.92, I was kind of neat.
4110.92,4111.92, Yeah.
4111.92,4112.92, I was kind of cool.
4112.92,4114.92," And I mean, I know there's some interesting things like this."
4114.92,4115.92, Right.
4115.92,4120.92, Giant creature in the game that basically is a walking high for these these terredactyl type things that come out of it.
4120.92,4121.92, And that kind of stuff sounds interesting.
4121.92,4126.92," But more to kind of his guy is, I mean, that was basically like a first person shooter of an auto assault quest."
4126.92,4131.92," I was just to say, like, well, what Mingo's Marauder's Mordica is, like basically Mingo."
4131.92,4132.92, Yeah.
4132.92,4134.92," I mean, you know what I did to see guys too much for liking their."
4134.92,4135.92," I mean, of course, I can like don't give him."
4135.92,4137.92," And the opposite would be weird, too."
4137.92,4139.92, They were up there hating on their game and the others.
4139.92,4140.92," And if they're not, I'm not sure."
4140.92,4142.92, I want to show you that fucking level.
4142.92,4143.92, You see this one's orange.
4143.92,4144.92, That's level three.
4144.92,4145.92, Okay.
4145.92,4148.92, Here's another one of our useless weapons.
4148.92,4149.92, Yeah.
4149.92,4150.92, There's a difference though.
4150.92,4152.92," I think like, you know, we've got with bad self-esteem."
4152.92,4153.92, You can get them.
4153.92,4158.92," The most impressive demonstrations that I've ever seen though, including like the E3,"
4158.92,4162.92, one for Half Life 2 and it was like a year or two before the game came out.
4162.92,4163.92, Yeah.
4163.92,4164.92, They say almost absolutely nothing.
4164.92,4165.92, You just watch them play.
4165.92,4168.92," Everyone in the room is like, can't wait to get out to tell everyone."
4168.92,4171.92, I don't know about how insanely awesome something was.
4171.92,4172.92, Right.
4172.92,4173.92," So I was like, you can say that too."
4173.92,4178.92," It's like you don't really need to oversell your stuff if it truly is, you know,"
4178.92,4180.92," yeah, truly is exciting."
4180.92,4181.92, Right.
4181.92,4182.92, Yeah.
4182.92,4183.92, I also played that.
4183.92,4185.92, Anyone else try a project origin?
4185.92,4186.92," Oh, not yet."
4186.92,4187.92, Okay.
4187.92,4188.92, It's been a million.
4188.92,4189.92, I plan on it.
4189.92,4190.92," I was like, it was cool."
4190.92,4191.92," It was really, yeah."
4191.92,4192.92," I mean, yeah."
4192.92,4193.92," Again, to save it like, monolith."
4193.92,4195.92, They really just get like in condemned as well.
4195.92,4197.92, Just get the visorality of sort of combat.
4197.92,4200.92," It's sort of combat scenarios that they, that they portray in their games."
4200.92,4204.92," And they, they're definitely addressing, you know, people complain that, you know,"
4204.92,4209.92, fear was a crawling through ventilation shafts and stuff and going through offices.
4209.92,4214.92," And so in this case, the level I played was all through this torn up city."
4214.92,4219.92," And again, just the, the bullet time stuff is done well."
4219.92,4222.92," You know, the bullet time was already all hat when fear came out."
4222.92,4224.92, Both no one cared because it just worked so well.
4224.92,4226.92," I mean, it, it, it delivered on it so well."
4226.92,4228.92," And that came, I mean, so that was there."
4228.92,4232.92," And I played this level where I got in the back and just, my God, my phone."
4232.92,4237.92," Just a, the visual quality of everything that was going on was just pretty incredible."
4237.92,4239.92," I mean, there's like smoke everywhere."
4239.92,4242.92," You're like, you know, enemies are emerging through the smoke and you're in this mech with"
4242.92,4245.92, this chain gun and you're ripping through them and it's pretty gross.
4245.92,4246.92," I mean, it reminds me of like a cure."
4246.92,4247.92, And I know they're inspired by a cure.
4247.92,4248.92, Yeah.
4248.92,4250.92," But it's just like, yeah, just pulping guys."
4250.92,4253.92," Everyone's, guys are turning into Mr. shooting these missiles."
4253.92,4257.92, They're kind of like the rockets from realbotech where there's like spiraling around through the environment and nailing
4257.92,4259.92, other mechs that are coming out at you and stuff.
4259.92,4266.92, And so from the short level that I played in that judging it only like not on the quality of its story or anything else.
4266.92,4268.92, My eyes starting to twitch.
4268.92,4269.92, I'm getting stressed.
4269.92,4270.92, Yeah.
4270.92,4271.92, Can I go?
4271.92,4272.92, Can I go?
4272.92,4273.92, Do you want to be dismissed?
4273.92,4277.92, Because because you're definitely into realms of that I am not familiar with.
4277.92,4279.92, It did pollging up because of redness.
4279.92,4280.92, It was scary.
4280.92,4282.92, It was the acuro when you brought up a cure.
4282.92,4285.92," It just like, well that triggered something inside Ken."
4285.92,4290.92, Maybe I have fallen asleep watching just too many times.
4290.92,4292.92, Can I make you mind?
4292.92,4293.92, E3 stress.
4293.92,4294.92, You can be dismissed.
4294.92,4295.92, Thank you Jen.
4295.92,4296.92, Thank you for having me.
4296.92,4298.92, It was meaningful and special.
4298.92,4299.92, It was special.
4299.92,4300.92, I'm sorry.
4300.92,4301.92, I'm stressed.
4301.92,4302.92," No, no."
4302.92,4303.92, We all have work to do here.
4303.92,4304.92, Yeah.
4304.92,4305.92, Where it's a late night here.
4305.92,4307.92, We're going to be on the right.
4307.92,4308.92, Yeah.
4308.92,4309.92, Yeah.
4309.92,4310.92, I want to bet for leaving early.
4310.92,4311.92, Yeah.
4311.92,4314.92, I'm getting pretty stressed too.
4314.92,4315.92, Yeah.
4315.92,4316.92, Yeah.
4316.92,4318.92, What do you do?
4318.92,4319.92," That's right, dude."
4319.92,4320.92, All right.
4320.92,4323.92," Well, did that put you were mid-centre there?"
4323.92,4324.92, Yeah.
4324.92,4325.92, I'm gonna finish it now.
4325.92,4327.92," Well, it's like the whole time I feel like I'm after imagine an audience."
4327.92,4329.92, I feel like I'm seeing stuff known cares about.
4329.92,4330.92, We can't really all got.
4330.92,4331.92, We got some care to be there.
4331.92,4333.92, They're podcast dynamic.
4333.92,4334.92, We don't.
4334.92,4335.92, None of us like the same kind of games.
4335.92,4336.92, What are you talking about?
4336.92,4340.92, I don't like shooting stuff in Sean.
4340.92,4343.92, Doesn't like picking up 10 Gore test glitters.
4343.92,4344.92, Yeah.
4344.92,4345.92, I like doing bugs.
4345.92,4346.92, You got to find them.
4346.92,4347.92, Yeah.
4347.92,4348.92, You're the conduit.
4348.92,4351.92, Just don't start talking about sports games and they're fucked.
4351.92,4352.92, What about Mario sports games?
4352.92,4353.92, It's okay.
4353.92,4354.92, All right.
4354.92,4355.92, Yeah.
4355.92,4356.92, I like Mario golf.
4356.92,4357.92, It's a good one.
4357.92,4359.92, What are you saying with that Sean Maloy here?
4359.92,4361.92, We've lost our unity.
4361.92,4362.92," No, I don't know."
4362.92,4364.92," I mean, we've always had different tastes and games."
4364.92,4365.92, I'm not okay.
4365.92,4366.92, I don't know.
4366.92,4369.92," For some reason this whole time, I'm like, there's like so many things I want to talk about."
4369.92,4372.92," I'm like, I know like you guys are like eyes are glasin' over."
4372.92,4373.92," I'm like, I won't talk about them."
4373.92,4374.92," But I'm like, where would I talk about him?"
4374.92,4376.92, It was like pretty much nowhere.
4376.92,4378.92," Well, that just makes me sad."
4378.92,4379.92, Yeah.
4379.92,4380.92, Like days are over.
4380.92,4381.92," Oh, man."
4381.92,4382.92, Don't start.
4382.92,4383.92, Don't start.
4383.92,4384.92, So I don't know.
4384.92,4386.92," I'm like, what else do we play?"
4386.92,4388.92," I mean, we played a whole lot today."
4388.92,4389.92, We did.
4389.92,4390.92, It was a very busy day.
4390.92,4391.92, It was too busy today.
4391.92,4392.92, It's not over.
4392.92,4393.92, We went to SOEs.
4393.92,4394.92, We did good.
4394.92,4396.92, So what do you think of DC online?
4396.92,4400.92, All they had to show was a trailer and like a little behind the scenes thing.
4400.92,4402.92, So there's not really much to go on.
4402.92,4408.92," But they're building it as sort of like a, like, I guess a cross between like an action RPG"
4408.92,4409.92, and an MMO.
4409.92,4411.92," Like you don't, they're saying it."
4411.92,4416.92," I'm like hitting, you don't want it to and watch it and it do, you know, punch another"
4416.92,4418.92, dude and watch a number pop up over his head.
4418.92,4421.92, Like I guess there's actual twitch involved.
4421.92,4423.92," Like you, you shoot an arrow at somebody."
4423.92,4424.92, You have to aim at them.
4424.92,4425.92," It's not like, aim at them."
4425.92,4431.92," It's this like closer to tabular rasa though then like, you know, got a worst"
4431.92,4433.92, direction or even.
4433.92,4435.92," I don't like, I don't like it."
4435.92,4436.92, So all they had was like a trailer.
4436.92,4439.92," So I don't really, I don't really, yeah, I don't know."
4439.92,4446.92," It was kind of odd if they sort of, they had a actual human there a guy very nice guy."
4446.92,4447.92, Chris was his name.
4447.92,4448.92, No real boss.
4448.92,4451.92," You mean, no, who said he was, you know, he was there."
4451.92,4455.92," He was there to introduce the thing we were going to watch, but then what we watched was like,"
4455.92,4456.92, other guys talking.
4456.92,4457.92, Yeah.
4457.92,4462.92," We watched the dudes who were there talking and right, and oh, yeah, and the other guys who are talking"
4462.92,4463.92, was standing right there.
4463.92,4464.92, It was a little weird.
4464.92,4467.92," It was like, why don't we turn off the video and you guys just talked to us."
4467.92,4470.92, Why don't you have to watch you talking to us when you're standing right there.
4470.92,4471.92," It was a little, it was a bit odd."
4471.92,4472.92, Yeah.
4472.92,4473.92, A bit of an uncoise.
4473.92,4476.92," Did you get like a free, like alarm clock radio?"
4476.92,4478.92," No, that's free."
4478.92,4479.92," Oh, wait."
4479.92,4481.92, I might have it here on my pocket here.
4481.92,4485.92," Got a free sort of like, no, no, what the fuck's this?"
4485.92,4486.92, Somewhere.
4486.92,4490.92," Sort of like a, it's like a Swiss Army knife sort of thing, but it was for the agency."
4490.92,4491.92, I don't know where it is.
4491.92,4492.92, I left it somewhere.
4492.92,4493.92, It'd be a superhero without one.
4493.92,4494.92," Oh, for the agency."
4494.92,4495.92, Yeah.
4495.92,4496.92, Yeah.
4496.92,4497.92," So, right."
4497.92,4499.92," I saw the agency, and the agency is, uh,"
4499.92,4500.92, Casimamo Royale.
4500.92,4504.92, The agency was a demo I got.
4505.92,4508.92," The, the agency's a demo I got with the two Jesuses."
4508.92,4510.92," So that was pretty funny because, wow."
4510.92,4512.92, Cause I was getting the demo with the main guy.
4512.92,4515.92, And then another guy walks up to join the demo.
4515.92,4517.92," And his name is like, Hazel's something rather,"
4517.92,4521.92," but the person, the, the like, PR person who walked him up said,"
4521.92,4523.92," Hey, hey, he wants to join the demo."
4523.92,4524.92, This is Jesus.
4524.92,4527.92, And she's caught him Jesus to the other guys.
4527.92,4528.92," Like, it's not Jesus."
4528.92,4530.92," It says, Hey, Zeus is last name was Hispanic."
4530.92,4532.92," Like, okay, but then the weird thing was like a minute later,"
4533.92,4535.92, a second Jesus walks up like how often does that happen?
4535.92,4536.92, But he wasn't Zeus.
4536.92,4538.92," No, he was probably also a Hazel."
4538.92,4540.92, So it was like two of his end to his hope.
4540.92,4542.92, And both name Hazel's.
4542.92,4545.92, So it was two Jesuses and me getting the demo.
4545.92,4548.92," But, but, actually, the funny part of the story to me was not that,"
4548.92,4549.92, it's not that funny really.
4549.92,4550.92," But, it was funny."
4550.92,4552.92," It was like, so the guy gives the demo."
4552.92,4555.92," And again, this was just, it wasn't a demo."
4555.92,4559.92, He was just introducing like a film that they've been show.
4559.92,4560.92, The trailer.
4561.92,4563.92, But it was actually a play.
4563.92,4566.92, It was a trailer of somebody playing the game.
4566.92,4569.92," So he was actually walking through the gameplay as he was,"
4569.92,4572.92," as he was, you know, showing this can film."
4572.92,4575.92," But anyway, so we watched this whole thing."
4575.92,4576.92, And it was kind of long.
4576.92,4579.92," It was like at least ten minutes, maybe more."
4579.92,4583.92," And, you know, he goes into detail about the mechanics and everything."
4583.92,4586.92," And then he goes at the end of his, do you have any questions?"
4586.92,4588.92," And one of the Jesuses goes,"
4589.92,4593.92," well, forgive me, but I don't know much about video games."
4593.92,4595.92, What's an MMO?
4595.92,4596.92, Are you serious?
4596.92,4597.92, Oh my God.
4597.92,4598.92, Wow.
4598.92,4601.92," You're like, I thought you were supposed to be on this ship, bro."
4601.92,4602.92, Yeah.
4602.92,4603.92, Yeah.
4603.92,4604.92, Don't you know everything?
4604.92,4605.92, Yeah.
4605.92,4607.92, So I just thought that was kind of funny.
4607.92,4610.92," That's, because you could see the look on his face."
4610.92,4612.92," The guy's been, he's been talking for like 15 minutes."
4612.92,4613.92," Especially, ready."
4613.92,4615.92, About all the dynamics about the game.
4615.92,4617.92," And it's like, oh, you didn't understand a word."
4617.92,4619.92," I said, yeah."
4619.92,4622.92," Well, see, this is a game you play online."
4622.92,4623.92, What's online?
4623.92,4624.92, Wow.
4624.92,4626.92, It's like imagine like that's amazing.
4626.92,4628.92, He gets scolded because of it.
4628.92,4629.92, Like one of his managers was there.
4629.92,4633.92, And like I told you to give these demos like you're giving them the Alexander Graham bell.
4633.92,4636.92," Like, you know, supposing that you're out against nose."
4636.92,4638.92, No more about games in general than Mr.
4638.92,4640.92," You know, you're an old lady."
4640.92,4641.92, Yeah.
4641.92,4645.92," So I didn't know what, what to think about the into it."
4645.92,4650.92," You know, this was their spy Sony spy MMO."
4650.92,4656.92," And yeah, it's a few years in the making now, right?"
4656.92,4657.92, Is that right?
4657.92,4660.92," It's, and how they, they didn't actually hear it."
4660.92,4661.92, They didn't show the same demo.
4661.92,4664.92," They showed last time, but it was very similar to the other demo."
4664.92,4666.92, I don't know.
4666.92,4668.92, I want to believe.
4668.92,4671.92, But I don't know if I can.
4671.92,4673.92," It's rough territory, new."
4673.92,4676.92," It's not, you know, it's not licensed for anything."
4676.92,4681.92," And as Conan shows you, even something is unremarkable as Conan."
4681.92,4684.92," I mean, in considering compared to like, you know,"
4684.92,4687.92, Lord of the Rings having all these movies have come out recently or something.
4687.92,4689.92," You know, like, where's the phage of Conan?"
4689.92,4690.92, Come out in the 80s.
4690.92,4691.92, It would have been the more popular one.
4691.92,4692.92," Hey, what the hell Conan?"
4692.92,4694.92, Conan is a force.
4694.92,4695.92," But it's like, yeah, taboo."
4695.92,4696.92, We also couldn't do it.
4696.92,4698.92, Auto stuff can do it.
4698.92,4700.92," It's like maybe they should consider like,"
4700.92,4702.92, It's kind of alternate like business model.
4702.92,4704.92, It's dangerous territory to want to enter now.
4704.92,4707.92, I do have to say that I thought we're hammer online.
4707.92,4708.92, Great.
4708.92,4709.92, Yeah.
4709.92,4710.92, You know what?
4710.92,4711.92, I'm afraid for that game.
4711.92,4712.92, Why are you?
4712.92,4716.92, They just announced recently that they're cutting back a bunch of features and we're going to make their launch date.
4716.92,4719.92," They've killed like four classes, four classes."
4719.92,4721.92," Like, how many were there?"
4721.92,4724.92," Several of which were like the,"
4724.92,4728.92, their attached races like tank class.
4728.92,4731.92," So there are races, because all the classes are divided."
4731.92,4735.92, Now these races have these four classes and these four classes.
4735.92,4739.92," And so there are races that are completely devoid of a tank class,"
4739.92,4743.92," which is, you know, one of the necessary components to a group."
4743.92,4745.92," And they've said that like,"
4745.92,4749.92, there's only going to instead of having like each race have a challenge starting city.
4749.92,4755.92," There's going to be like one starting city for, you know, this side and one starting city for this side."
4755.92,4756.92, Like they've substantially.
4756.92,4759.92, And they had the whole idea that there would be like these four city deals.
4759.92,4760.92, Now they're only two.
4760.92,4764.92," Right. There's like, you know, seven or eight races or something, you know."
4764.92,4767.92, And they've they've paired it down so much.
4767.92,4771.92," Like, I don't understand how they decided to kill what they killed."
4771.92,4773.92," Well, what if they really does?"
4773.92,4778.92," Just basically just scaling back for a launch and then like they can go and patch this stuff in later,"
4778.92,4779.92, which would seem fine.
4779.92,4781.92," Yeah, that's the problem though."
4781.92,4783.92, How Apeshitz should you go about content.
4783.92,4786.92, You're not going to get to him until you've played for hundreds of hours.
4786.92,4788.92, We're talking about starting to class.
4788.92,4790.92," Yeah, the class thing is is disturbing."
4790.92,4791.92, Right.
4791.92,4794.92," Because like look at what you know, fun calm made some significant class changes part of release"
4794.92,4795.92, and the edge of coming in.
4795.92,4797.92," And they've emerged a bunch of classes, right?"
4797.92,4798.92, Yeah.
4798.92,4801.92, And I think that as far as balance goes that proved to be fairly disastrous.
4801.92,4804.92, And those were precisely the overpowered classes.
4804.92,4805.92, Right.
4805.92,4809.92, But they had elements from each of these other classes that really would take it.
4809.92,4812.92," They have, have been taking more work to balance."
4812.92,4813.92, Right.
4813.92,4814.92," So this game,"
4815.92,4816.92, I don't know.
4816.92,4818.92," But hey, the game's also got to come out too."
4818.92,4820.92," I mean, what would you?"
4820.92,4821.92," I don't know, man."
4821.92,4823.92, I can't advise anything when I'm talking to you.
4823.92,4825.92," You know, every time every time I do."
4825.92,4830.92," No, if it's going to bomb, and then it would be a waste to spend another six months fixing this tank class for Ryan."
4830.92,4836.92," Or it will be popular and it will be like, hey, you guys, you guys helped us see through this first few months."
4836.92,4839.92," Really, it is the most unpredictable genre."
4839.92,4842.92, This is like the if I is going to go into game development.
4842.92,4843.92, This is the one genre.
4843.92,4844.92, I would not want to talk to you.
4844.92,4845.92, It's like fuck this.
4845.92,4856.92," It's, I mean, years of development, you know, all the resources that the overhead of the servers, the overhead of the personnel to deal with these things."
4856.92,4859.92," And just the intense utterly, you know, impossible to predict,"
4859.92,4862.92, crap shoot of whether people are going to dig it or not.
4862.92,4866.92," Almost all the biggest, you know, horror stories we've written the past few years."
4866.92,4867.92," Oh, yeah."
4867.92,4869.92, So you're on going one with flagship right now.
4869.92,4874.92, What do you want to do with like if the game's not in them and what would be big ambitious multiplayer games that.
4874.92,4875.92, Right.
4875.92,4877.92, They're going to make their revenue through subscriptions.
4877.92,4878.92, Sure.
4878.92,4883.92," Every time I hear something like this, like, with any, with any game, you know,"
4883.92,4891.92," their cutting features in order to make some settings don't launch day, you know, for their quarterly profit or whatever,"
4891.92,4898.92," it's like I think, you know, there's like a few publishers like Blizzard or Valve or like Nintendo or Rockstar."
4898.92,4906.92," You know, whenever you ask them like when is your game being released, their answers always like it's going to be done when it's done."
4906.92,4908.92," You know, they're not because of none of them are beholden."
4908.92,4912.92, But all their games come out and they're way more awesome for it.
4912.92,4922.92, Like I don't see why other companies don't kind of see that as well because a lot of them right approach beholden to their stock and look what it takes to get to that position.
4922.92,4925.92, It takes good products.
4925.92,4927.92, And they took the time to make that good product.
4927.92,4937.92," And it's like, but yeah, it's like it's like, like self petrarying cycle to it's like you're, you're, you know, your publisher's not going to be like, yeah, take all the time in the world you want like Valve takes time and it guarantees something's going to be good."
4937.92,4939.92," It's like, right, did you make fucking half life?"
4939.92,4940.92, Did you make half life too?
4940.92,4941.92, Did you make granted thought of it?
4941.92,4942.92, Did you make by city?
4942.92,4943.92, No.
4943.92,4944.92, Wasn't quit asking for all the time in the world.
4944.92,4946.92, It's ready when we say it's fucking ready.
4946.92,4947.92, Right.
4947.92,4948.92," No, that's totally right."
4948.92,4949.92," Yeah, they earned that."
4949.92,4950.92, Right.
4950.92,4954.92," But, but who's to say, you know, company X could keep saying, well, it's good."
4954.92,4964.92," It'll be done when we're ready because we're not releasing until it's perfect, you know, but if they have no track record and the game turns out to be a piece of shit when it comes out, well, then, you know,"
4964.92,4967.92," Well, then you can, like, look how long like Vanguard took to make."
4967.92,4968.92," Well, there, there you go."
4968.92,4971.92," That's a classic one of the classic examples, right?"
4971.92,4974.92," Yeah, I mean, there's so many games we know that have been in development forever."
4974.92,4978.92," And then when they come out, you're like, or it just gets problematic too."
4978.92,4981.92," I mean, like, there's some cases where games come out with all the time and they're good."
4981.92,4985.92," Like, I think Quake Wars came out, I think it was an excellent game, but I think it came out too late."
4985.92,4991.92," If it did come out, especially for the PC market, if it did come out the same year, the Battlefield 2142 did."
4991.92,5001.92," And I think it would have been like a smash hit because that was the time, like, especially in my life as like, you know, being like the kind of Battlefield 2 player totally into that."
5001.92,5002.92, And ready to move on.
5002.92,5004.92, I was ready to move on to the next thing.
5005.92,5007.92, 2040 to come out and it didn't do it for me at all.
5007.92,5010.92," And I was like, I really wanted Quake Wars and that would have occupied it."
5010.92,5013.92," But instead of it's like, that's when I started getting the company heroes."
5013.92,5016.92," And now it's just like, okay, there's not a good shooter out from you to plan PC right now."
5016.92,5017.92, I'm going to try something else.
5017.92,5021.92," And then when it did come out, it's like everyone's like, do this doom engine."
5021.92,5022.92," Like, this isn't like that good."
5022.92,5025.92," But I remember when we first saw Quake Wars was like, wow, this is amazing."
5025.92,5027.92," But I mean, time."
5027.92,5031.92," It's just like, yeah, like, games are based on like fancy technology."
5031.92,5033.92, You can't take forever.
5034.92,5035.92, Yeah.
5035.92,5038.92," I mean, we could be talking about a few months difference with Warhammer."
5038.92,5039.92," I mean, I don't know."
5039.92,5044.92," It's not like it's never reassuring, but at least they're being upfront about it instead of releasing"
5044.92,5048.92," the game saying, oh, yeah, I remember that shit we were talking about all the Citadel."
5048.92,5050.92," Yeah, he there."
5050.92,5054.92," I saw um, crisis warhead to be happy."
5054.92,5055.92, Just check that.
5055.92,5056.92, How that look.
5056.92,5057.92, I got to play it.
5057.92,5059.92, And the section I played was pretty fun.
5059.92,5061.92, Imagine just like the lost levels of crisis.
5061.92,5066.92," But um, kind of like, I mean, they it was funny to see like their whole point of,"
5066.92,5069.92, this is what's different about this game from crisis.
5069.92,5074.92," Like, everyone on point by point was like, it was addressing my concerns with the first game."
5074.92,5077.92," And I mean, it was like, okay, cool, I must not have been alone because I mean,"
5077.92,5080.92," I certainly don't think that they're like, yeah, let's make this game for sure."
5080.92,5082.92," But there just like, he wasn't crazy."
5082.92,5085.92," He wasn't the only one saying, yeah, we internally."
5085.92,5088.92," And they were saying, you know, they're like, yes, internally, we agree."
5088.92,5092.92," We didn't, you know, for whatever the reason had not been able to get the game out,"
5092.92,5096.92," you know, here we go again to schedules, having to get the game out sooner than we're ready or"
5096.92,5097.92, over whatever reason.
5097.92,5099.92," Some of it, I think had to do with the mince back."
5099.92,5104.92," I mean, the minimum specifications that you could play the game on."
5104.92,5110.92, And what that means is basically anything above mince back in a piece of game has to be visual only.
5110.92,5112.92, You can't work game plan to it.
5112.92,5116.92," So say, for example, if you have this like a building to do all this stuff of freezing and"
5116.92,5121.92," and shattering, but it's happening above the mince back level, that means that it can only look cool."
5121.92,5126.92, You can't base gameplay around enemies shattering cover for easing and stuff.
5126.92,5128.92, So I think that had to do something with it.
5128.92,5132.92," But the whole, the whole notion of prices toward the end becomes totally linear."
5132.92,5136.92," They came, you know, like in my review, I said it teaches you to fish and then throws you in a desert."
5136.92,5141.92," In this case, it would be like, as you're playing the game, you ramp up and ramp up and you're like,"
5141.92,5144.92," eventually you're doing things with total confidence like dropping C4,"
5144.92,5151.92," switching this strength suit parameter, throwing it like a football and then detonating it as it lands on a tank or throwing it at helicopter or something."
5151.92,5156.92, And then all of a sudden you're in this place where there's like no imagination required whatsoever you got to get in a Jeep.
5156.92,5159.92, You can't even switch seats anymore and you just shoot it anything that comes out at you.
5159.92,5165.92, So now there's tons of vehicle stuff and it was really about emphasizing that we're going to have that scale of combat.
5165.92,5170.92," We wanted it with their stuff coming everywhere, but it's like you can get many vehicle you want."
5170.92,5175.92," And if your vehicle takes a big hit, just jump out and go hide and scale someone else's vehicle and keep going."
5175.92,5177.92, And the gameplay was awesome.
5177.92,5179.92," You just like, you know, crisis was cool."
5179.92,5181.92, I did get from them.
5181.92,5187.92, It was interesting that originally because I'm curious because this game is set concurrently with events of the original crisis.
5187.92,5189.92," That's kind of like a rose of grants, guilt and stern pain."
5189.92,5195.92," And I was like, did you were you writing the script for this at the same time that you were writing for Scamors?"
5195.92,5196.92, This and afterthought.
5197.92,5199.92, It was kind of like somewhere in between.
5199.92,5205.92," They were still finishing crisis when they got to this point with this game, but it wasn't like they weren't designed exactly at the same time."
5205.92,5206.92, Right.
5206.92,5214.92," So you know, there were, I was suspicious that there's all these ways to establish a crisis chronology."
5214.92,5215.92, Right.
5215.92,5219.92," You know, when this big volcano erupts and things certainly might be visible, no matter where you're at."
5219.92,5223.92," Well, that's kind of like, like, what blue shift, right? Was that what it was?"
5223.92,5227.92, So you could say this is a point when there's this like facility blows up or something and you can get that.
5227.92,5228.92, So they're doing that.
5228.92,5235.92," But originally, I think the idea was for their Budapest studio to to make an expansion straight forward."
5235.92,5240.92," Your traditional notion of it. And they're like, okay, you guys are doing good things with this go ahead."
5240.92,5241.92, Make this a full game.
5241.92,5244.92," And someone going to be like 29, 99, it's coming out."
5244.92,5245.92, I really soon.
5245.92,5246.92, I think it's August.
5246.92,5250.92," And if there are some surprises, like, you know, are there any big surprises?"
5250.92,5256.92," I couldn't get them to talk. I mean, I was, we were talking about how, well, I do know that the ice wave levels back in,"
5256.92,5260.92, that they're able to take some things that they weren't able to put in the crisis and work them in here.
5260.92,5265.92, And that was originally getting between the aircraft carrier at the end of the game and the shores like the whole oceans frozen.
5265.92,5271.92," And you're basically going out across the frozen ocean and there's frozen tsunami waves, you know, that you're going to open stuff."
5271.92,5274.92, That's making its way back in.
5275.92,5283.92," Maybe the hudders of the big giant alien walkers. I mean, I keep asking them, like, do we get to drive one of those, you know, like some kind of like stuff like that."
5283.92,5287.92," And they just keep, you know, smiling, let me believe whatever I want to believe."
5287.92,5300.92," So do you think that if they fix a lot of stuff that was, you know, broken or not so great in crisis that for somebody who hasn't played crisis that it would be better to maybe just get this."
5300.92,5309.92, Because I think that crisis is a fantastic game. I don't recommend anyone's gifts. Okay. I think everyone should play it despite its flaws.
5309.92,5318.92," Yeah, and it's flaws are really just like the only stand out more so because you're so impressed with everything that goes before."
5318.92,5323.92," Well, you did only give it an eight, which we've established."
5323.92,5330.92," I actually been in again. My mind is, is a very strong recommendation. Yes. I think she played. I think, yeah, I think you'll like enjoy."
5330.92,5335.92," And I know there's some stuff that they won't, they're not explaining what it is yet. Sounds like an experimental here."
5335.92,5342.92," But what they're calling crisis wars, the new multiplayer content for this game, but I don't think it's going to be just this game."
5342.92,5350.92," I don't want to like, you know, fraction or user base. So it sounds like maybe it's going to be like people that already own crisis get to download it or maybe download it for a fee."
5350.92,5359.92," They're just trying to figure something out, you know, to get it to everyone. But it's basically an all new setup for multiplayer for the game. However, it works remains to be seen."
5359.92,5360.92, That sounds cool.
5360.92,5362.92, I had a lot of fun playing today.
5362.92,5366.92," Where's it at at the, it's in the showcase building."
5366.92,5375.92," Okay. And it's amazing too that like years now. You know, remember when we first started seeing that game of the three, how it visually was the most spectacular thing in the whole."
5375.92,5381.92," It's like you can go play it now and it's still, you're like, find something that looks better in this building."
5381.92,5388.92," That's this kind of game. I mean, it's still like, you know, I went and I looked at a lot of stuff. You know, from a project origin looks fantastic."
5388.92,5394.92," I think it's a resistance to it. And it's like, not of like, come close to looking as good as crisis."
5394.92,5404.92," And and functioning in the level that it does where, you know, instead of like patching in destructive ability where there's like a wall that's tagged to have a piece of it disappear when it gets in."
5404.92,5412.92, It disappears when it gets hit with a grenade with a actual building is composed of 100 different pieces and they will actually get blown apart in real time.
5412.92,5415.92," I do need to see red faction. I want to go see that. Yeah, I haven't seen that."
5415.92,5417.92," Yeah, it's a reflection. Really. Yeah."
5417.92,5418.92, It's kind of much as respectable.
5418.92,5419.92, Very good stuff.
5419.92,5421.92, Still a lot to see.

5431.92,5439.92," One, when we're recording one of those calls was from in Guy Crawl from Newsweek's level up. He is apologizing for missing the time."
5439.92,5442.92, I know he wants to to stop by.
