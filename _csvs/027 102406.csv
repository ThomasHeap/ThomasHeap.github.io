117.16,118.16, It's the same as anything.
118.16,120.16," It's like the Wii here, the 360."
120.16,122.16, So we hate it all that shit.
122.16,124.16, And I know nothing sounds weird.
124.16,125.16, Yeah.
125.16,129.16," So we're going to have a short podcast today, even though we are weak off."
129.16,133.16, And that's because we're podcast heavy here at Zifdeem's media.
133.16,136.16," So if you're mad about the half hour podcast today,"
136.16,139.16, go blame the folks at the RetroNots podcast.
139.16,140.16, Okay.
140.16,143.16, That's going to be a later today and they're cutting in on us.
143.16,148.16," So if you're pissed at this podcast a short, you should go to the one up message boards."
148.16,151.16," And if there's a RetroNots thing up there, I don't know if there is or not."
151.16,155.16," And tell that, tell us, say screw you for cutting off CGW."
155.16,156.16, And tell them Jeff sent you.
156.16,160.16, All you blogging nuts and internaughts complain about the RetroNots.
160.16,162.16," You know, I'm going to be on that podcast."
162.16,165.16," You're going to be on that podcast, Ryan."
165.16,166.16," Alright, today's group."
166.16,169.16," You're going to be on that podcast, Ryan."
169.16,170.16, Yeah.
170.16,171.16, Today's group.
171.16,173.16, We're going to be on the top there at RetroNots.
173.16,175.16, So make them wait.
175.16,176.16, Jerk.
176.16,177.16, They don't make games like they used to.
177.16,180.16," Alright. So we're going to, is that what they do on RetroNots?"
180.16,181.16, They talking.
181.16,182.16, My gay.
182.16,185.16, I remember actually today it's it's topical the PC gaming.
185.16,187.16, They're talking about salmon max.
187.16,188.16, Hmm.
188.16,189.16," So, uh huh."
189.16,192.16," Well, we talked about that on our podcast and we talked about it a week ago."
192.16,194.16, Do you prefer two weeks ago?
194.16,198.16, The gothic starlings of Castlevania's protagonist.
198.16,201.16, You like the Metroid's Sam is hearing.
201.16,203.16, It's totally going to be about that.
203.16,204.16, You know it.
204.16,206.16," Yeah, they just listen to us."
206.16,207.16, It's cool.
207.16,208.16, It's cool.
208.16,209.16, Come here and pull it.
209.16,210.16," Yeah, we're coming down here and pulling the plug."
210.16,213.16," Yeah, we're going to do one of those, like, you know, punk things."
213.16,214.16, I remember something.
214.16,215.16," We're like, Jerk."
215.16,216.16, Can't wait.
216.16,217.16, Jerk ass.
217.16,220.16," Alright. So, uh, instead of complaining, maybe we should talk about."
220.16,222.16, We should say some stuff.
222.16,223.16, Four minutes of it.
223.16,224.16, Right.
224.16,225.16, Alright.
225.16,227.16," So amongst the topics here, we have the wow,"
227.16,230.16," uh, burning crusade beta, which Sean and I've been on a bit."
230.16,236.16," Uh, Mr. Malois has been playing, uh, I mean, Mr. Elliot has been on Battlefield 2142."
236.16,243.16," I tried to play Battlefield 2042 and I got hit with some freaking, uh, air all weekend, which I think was Microsoft's fault."
243.16,245.16," There's got, uh, my sponsor."
245.16,247.16, I got the scoop on that one.
247.16,248.16, Should we start with that?
248.16,250.16, That's okay.
250.16,251.16, All right.
251.16,252.16, But the hack.
252.16,253.16," Alright, I can sit up."
253.16,255.16," I'm going to, I got the, I got the cure for your right here."
255.16,257.15999999999997, So I'm just going to read this for Betham.
257.15999999999997,259.15999999999997, There's a security patch in Windows XP.
259.15999999999997,260.15999999999997, It's messing with the game.
260.15999999999997,261.15999999999997," It's basically, uh, you hit Google in this."
261.15999999999997,262.15999999999997, But a lot of guys complaining about it.
262.15999999999997,263.15999999999997," Now, this is a development for us."
263.15999999999997,264.15999999999997, Is this a bunch of games?
264.15999999999997,265.15999999999997, Yeah.
265.15999999999997,266.15999999999997, Happening on a couple of games.
266.15999999999997,270.15999999999997," But I think it's most probably been happening with, people are noticing what's 2142."
270.15999999999997,272.15999999999997, Because that's the game that most people bought and installed this way.
272.15999999999997,273.15999999999997, Exactly.
273.15999999999997,275.15999999999997," So basically, it's Windows update,"
275.15999999999997,277.15999999999997, KB 917422.
277.15999999999997,279.15999999999997, That's what's causing all the problems.
279.15999999999997,280.15999999999997, There's an end.
280.15999999999997,281.15999999999997, I love their name.
281.15999999999997,282.15999999999997, I know.
282.16,283.16, Yeah.
283.16,284.16, So memorable. Why they just call it MS Bob.
284.16,288.16," Maybe they should have, we should, our name for the magazine could have been that."
288.16,290.16," Otherwise, AB 247."
290.16,292.16," So suddenly, I'm about to play 1,100."
292.16,293.16, 142.
293.16,294.16, 142.
294.16,295.16, One more time?
295.16,297.16, Just text fun.
297.16,298.16, Did you?
298.16,301.16, For your favorite new jokes every day.
301.16,307.16," So basically, you can either remove KB 917422 or you install hot fix,"
307.16,311.16, KB 92487 or one more thing.
311.16,314.16," You call 800 936, 3100 and Microsoft."
314.16,315.16, Really?
315.16,317.16, Carefully spoon feed you the process.
317.16,318.16, It's great.
318.16,320.16, We made a partnership with these guys.
320.16,321.16," So, okay."
321.16,323.16," So actually, here's the short version."
323.16,325.16," You know, why is this?"
325.16,328.16, So go to control panel and remove programs in the show updates.
328.16,330.16, Just look for it and hit remove.
330.16,331.16, Look for again.
331.16,333.16, What is it? Who's paying $8.99742?
333.16,334.16, There you go.
334.16,335.16, Wow.
335.16,336.16, That's the McKloi.
336.16,337.16, Ding ding ding ding.
337.16,338.16, And hit the remove button.
338.16,339.16," So, that's it."
339.16,342.16," So, probably one year, less successful Microsoft updates then."
342.16,343.16, Right.
343.16,348.16, Your next potential impediment that getting into B of 2142 now is going to be the punk
348.16,349.16, Buster violation.
349.16,353.16," Because in a lot of cases, it's not auto updating."
353.16,355.16, The punk Buster HTML files.
355.16,356.16, You're going to need to go.
356.16,358.16, What's going to happen is you're going to go into a game.
358.16,361.16," And after a minute or less, you're going to be kicked for a violation."
361.16,364.16, And meaning the violation meaning you don't have the latest punk Buster.
364.16,365.16, Right.
365.16,368.16," So, what you're going to have to do is go to the punk Buster site and download for whatever"
369.16,370.16, You're not getting it.
370.16,373.16, Like Lee Windows and get the get the two files on there and put them in your.
373.16,376.16, It did not come on the Battlefield 2142 desk.
376.16,379.16," I don't know if it's a punk Buster problem or or what,"
379.16,382.16," but it's just, yeah, it's just not auto updating."
382.16,383.16," So, that's going to."
383.16,385.16," So, get that out of the way and then you should be good to go."
385.16,386.16, Okay.
386.16,387.16, Okay.
387.16,388.16, One way.
388.16,389.16, Okay.
389.16,390.16, One thing.
390.16,393.16," After you get the patch, you're going to have to get that to you."
393.16,395.16, And it might take about four or five tries to get it to register.
395.16,396.16, When you when you patch.
396.16,397.16, Great.
397.16,398.16, It's full proof.
398.16,399.16, It works.
399.16,401.16," You know, I just buy an Xbox 360."
401.16,402.16, And now the podcast.
402.16,403.16, It has to go over to.
403.16,407.16," Actually, one thing I got to throw out there before we go to for our topic."
407.16,411.16, I got to people are some people don't be concerned that you're not actually opening
411.16,413.16, yourself up to hackers if you remove this update.
413.16,418.16, All it basically they say the only way you can open yourself up the trouble is if one
418.16,423.16," user running on the machine can force himself to a higher privilege, which means they have to be"
423.16,425.16, basically be in your house on your machine.
426.16,427.16, Okay.
427.16,429.16," So if you're if you're roommates a hacker, then you've got to worry."
429.16,430.16, But other than that.
430.16,431.16, Okay.
431.16,438.16," And then while we're on the 2142, is there any update to the whole crap we talked about a couple"
438.16,443.16," weeks ago with the in-game advertising and the, you know, so called spyware."
443.16,444.16, There's a lot of crazy.
444.16,447.16, Like it kind of like blown out of proportion and like all over the web really quickly.
447.16,448.16, Thanks to us.
448.16,449.16, Yeah.
449.16,450.16, We blaze that train.
450.16,452.16, No sensationalist journalism.
452.16,453.16, Yeah.
453.16,456.16," Well, you know, we read the notice in the box."
456.16,458.16, That wasn't we didn't make that up.
458.16,459.16, Right.
459.16,461.16," I think everyone else just kind of took it like five steps too far thinking, okay,"
461.16,462.16," hey, be as corpus now."
462.16,463.16, It was going to happen.
463.16,464.16, It was going to happen.
464.16,465.16, Yeah.
465.16,466.16, It was going to spread in immediately.
466.16,469.16," People are going to, I mean, especially because the company, the publishers,"
469.16,471.16, EA and it's so many people already.
471.16,477.16," It's like fun to to be skeptical about EA or to hate EA for being the big, you know."
477.16,479.16, But being the big thing.
479.16,480.16, The short.
480.16,484.16," The last time that would happen as soon as the game came out, hackers coming in and"
484.16,485.16, like basically shutting down the.
485.16,486.16, So you on that.
486.16,488.16," No, yeah, people that something awful for him."
488.16,490.16, So the goons as they call themselves.
490.16,491.16," Yeah, goons."
491.16,495.16, Found a way to basically lock down the ad thing.
495.16,498.16, So that it's not able to update itself and they put in their own JPEG images.
498.16,499.16, So they've got.
499.16,500.16, You can go.
500.16,502.16, We can put the link up on our forum.
502.16,503.16, If you're on the trouble.
503.16,507.16, But if you could basically put in whatever images you want so that they're stuck on the
508.16,509.16, billboards.
509.16,511.16, Like a giant penis up there.
511.16,512.1600000000001," Yeah, I don't want to see it."
512.1600000000001,514.1600000000001," No, but yeah, only you would see right."
514.1600000000001,515.1600000000001, Right.
515.1600000000001,516.1600000000001, Okay.
516.1600000000001,517.1600000000001, Because it's something else there.
517.1600000000001,520.1600000000001, The reason being is because the ads change per player.
520.1600000000001,521.1600000000001, It's not like they have infinite.
521.1600000000001,524.1600000000001," Combinations of ads, but they've got."
524.1600000000001,525.1600000000001, I don't know.
525.1600000000001,528.1600000000001," In some way, they see, you know, they're able to say, hey, this is a mail between"
528.1600000000001,532.1600000000001, the ages of whatever 30 and 35 or he's 18 and or whatever.
532.1600000000001,534.1600000000001, And then and it's sort of cater.
534.1600000000001,536.1600000000001," You know, and also according to region two."
536.16,539.16," And you know, because that's content specific to the Europeans playing."
539.16,542.16," So if you're playing some people in Ireland, they're looking at different ads than"
542.16,543.16, you playing.
543.16,547.16, Don't they don't they basically get ad for ads for potatoes over there.
547.16,548.16, Say.
548.16,549.16," Yeah, man."
549.16,550.16, How long you look at the ads?
550.16,551.16, Like don't they measure that?
551.16,553.16," And yeah, that's the thing is like how long you're looking at it."
553.16,554.16, It was funny.
554.16,557.16, I saw someone in a forum responded that they don't want to.
557.16,561.16, Just because someone's high that they're trying that they've been trying to fight
561.16,562.16, spend hiding behind the billboard.
562.16,565.16, They don't want anyone assuming that they're in love with preparation age.
566.16,568.16, But everything can be.
568.16,573.16," I saw in a station in game like protests, but everyone just collectively blows up a billboard or something."
573.16,576.16," Yeah, they must be in distress."
576.16,584.16," Funny thing about the company, IGA, that is providing that technology for the game is insisting that they are."
584.16,589.16, That all the images for the advertisements are being created exclusively for this context.
589.16,593.16," So they're not just taking, you know, whatever, PDF of a net of an existing ad campaign and then"
593.16,606.16," a that that can help your brim on with your whatnot, and just comprar, so how much of that"
606.16,610.16, you're taking and you're talking about that's becoming huge and I can really get you to
610.16,611.16, bring it back to you.
611.16,617.16," So like, let's say like you have someone that you can learn with every motion setting it and people"
617.16,619.16, What do they need to sell to the guys?
619.16,621.66," Like her, a pack of smokes and maybe a couple of parkos."
621.66,622.16, Right.
622.16,627.16," So yeah, we'll see what happens with that."
627.16,631.16, But so far the ads are not up in the game yet.
631.16,634.16, They're just empty billboards right.
634.16,636.16, They have placeholder things.
636.16,638.16," They have just like some, like, some,"
638.16,641.16," you found some art last time was that just from a,"
641.16,643.16, that was some BS stuff.
643.16,644.16, People been photoshopping it.
644.16,647.16," So there's this one great screen that I showed,"
647.16,649.16," I think I showed Ryan, but there's,"
649.16,652.16, it's just a complete awesome parody where everything is covered.
652.16,654.16, Every inch is covered in a sticker.
654.16,656.16," Like, you know, if it's a battle walker."
656.16,658.16, It looks like an ass car.
658.16,661.16," The little drones flying over squad leaders heads of got,"
661.16,665.16," you know, McDonald's, Archisonum and that's the future of the inch."
665.16,669.16," Yeah, every inch of open space is covered and something or the other."
669.16,671.16, That's what's common and I can't wait personally.
671.16,672.16," Yeah, that's going to be fine."
672.16,675.16," How, how many billboards you're in a given, or I give a,"
675.16,679.16," You know, you know, how, how, I mean, everyone was completely outraged about this."
679.16,680.16, Yeah.
680.16,682.16," But every day walking around the city,"
682.16,685.16," I saw him with the jacket on that's got not only like an Oreo ad,"
685.16,687.16," but it's got like McDonald's and like,"
687.16,689.16," like, came hard or Walmart."
689.16,692.16," It's got like 50 of them and they're like, where the entire US population"
692.16,694.16," walks around, they're walking billboards."
694.16,695.16, Right.
695.16,696.16," So you think that you're playing the game of like,"
696.16,698.16, and they got Oreos here too.
698.16,699.16, Right.
699.16,700.16, So that's a good game.
700.16,701.16, Right.
701.16,702.16, I'm going to throw it through on my back.
702.16,703.16, I'm looking at I'm looking around this room.
703.16,706.16, I'm seeing it as for once.
706.16,707.16, I'm kind of not.
707.16,710.16," But yeah, you know, there's like,"
710.16,713.16," like 8,000 guys wearing a Dita's T-shirt saying,"
713.16,715.16," Man, I hate these advertisements."
715.16,716.16, Right.
716.16,717.16, Hi.
717.16,718.16," Yeah, you are one."
718.16,719.16, Yeah.
719.16,722.16," Of course, if anyone's listening to this wearing it a Dita shirt,"
722.16,723.16, we love not.
723.16,724.16, I don't mean you.
724.16,726.16," You, we like the guy next to you on the bus."
726.16,727.16, Right.
727.16,728.16, He's the jerk.
728.16,729.16, Let's be aware of you.
729.16,730.16, We love it.
731.16,732.16, Sorry.
732.16,734.16, So grab me today.
734.16,736.16," Moly, let's talk about burning crusade."
736.16,738.16, Let's talk about burning crusade.
738.16,739.16, Are you happy?
739.16,740.16, I am happy.
740.16,744.16," Are you playing the post 60 content,"
744.16,747.16," so the offense stuff with my little 60 priest,"
747.16,750.16, a friend of the mother did a couple.
750.16,752.16," Did the first of the first,"
752.16,754.16, a new five man instances.
754.16,757.16," And the big stink about,"
758.16,759.16, I'm sorry.
759.16,761.16," Anyway, the big stink that everyone's raising is that"
761.16,765.16," the drops you get, like in the first quest item,"
765.16,767.16, the first question turned in.
767.16,769.16, The item you get is a comparable to some of the
769.16,772.16, like tier one and two two gear that people
772.16,774.16, were spending like six months of their lives rating for.
774.16,776.16, Right.
776.16,777.16," So pretty much,"
777.16,778.16," people rating,"
778.16,780.16," they're not going to be like,"
780.16,782.16," they're not going to be like,"
782.16,783.16," they're not going to be like,"
783.16,784.16," they're not going to be like,"
784.16,785.16," they're not going to be like,"
786.16,787.16," so pretty much,"
787.16,789.16, people rating constantly does all they do.
789.16,790.16, Right.
790.16,791.16," Expansion comes out,"
791.16,792.16," they walk in, they do some really"
792.16,794.16, comparatively super civil.
794.16,795.16, Quest.
795.16,796.16, And then.
796.16,798.16, That's basically that need.
798.16,799.16, It's necessary.
799.16,800.16," It isn't necessary in a favor,"
800.16,802.16, but it's but to all those people who
802.16,803.16," span all that time,"
803.16,804.16," I mean,"
804.16,805.16, this was a pretty so.
805.16,806.16, This was a pretty sore point.
806.16,808.16," And I'm cool with it because I'm kind of,"
808.16,809.16," like, on the ladder,"
809.16,810.16," up on your arm,"
810.16,811.16, and I'm all true.
811.16,812.16, I heard sometimes.
812.16,813.16," Yeah,"
813.16,816.16, I'm like tier one which is the last 60 hours.
816.16,818.16," Yeah, I just play it up to play it."
818.16,823.16," But yeah, I mean, it's kind of, I mean, you could see where they're coming from, but what are you going to do?"
823.16,826.16," I mean, I'm just playing those afkite."
826.16,827.16, I agree.
827.16,829.16," No, I actually agree with the two because I'm the latter of rating."
829.16,830.16, I'm like really low.
830.16,834.16," Like I have tier one gear, which is essentially like if someone didn't like a real rating guild,"
834.16,837.16," saw me last and say tier one, whatever."
837.16,838.16, I got that two years ago.
838.16,841.16," So to me, this is kind of like, you know,"
841.16,843.16, I'm suddenly equal footing with all right.
843.16,844.16, Other.
844.16,846.16," Yeah, I've never even made level 60 once yet."
846.16,848.16, My main guy is 58 now.
848.16,852.16, And by the time Burning Crusade starts and I go in and get a couple of those green drops.
852.16,857.16, I'll have his good at gear as the guys who spent forever rating for two years.
857.16,859.16," But for me, that's awesome."
859.16,861.16, So now I won't be behind those guys anymore.
861.16,864.16," But for them are those guys, do you think any of them are going to just like,"
864.16,868.16," We're thinking, no, we're just going to stick to the original game."
868.16,869.16," No, there's no way."
869.16,871.16, I don't think so because they're not going to add any.
871.16,872.16, The.
872.16,874.16," The reason they're like, they're fine with the idea."
874.16,875.16, I'm not going to add.
875.16,879.16," And like if they have the tier three gear, which is currently the highest stuff in the game."
879.16,883.16," Like if you get all that, what do you do then you get to your four or what is the main thing?"
883.16,885.16," Right, though, they could still stay as be Lord God."
885.16,887.16," But like people, they want to play still."
887.16,888.16, I don't know.
888.16,893.16," I think some people like will come to the realization that, oh my god, I just wasted six months of life."
893.16,895.16," Well, let me, I'm trying to find some way where they didn't waste it."
895.16,898.16," So say for example, the new green drops or whatever, this kind of,"
898.16,900.16," what we're doing is,"
900.16,904.16," more effective than what they spent 60 hours acquiring in the game as it is now, right?"
904.16,905.16, Yeah.
905.16,910.16," So what about if instead of recruiting their investment in terms of like the payoff of gameplay,"
910.16,911.16, what about for the cash?
911.16,915.16," Can they still sell those into a Blizzard run bank in the game for like,"
915.16,918.16," Oh, no, no, because they're going to be a diminished."
918.16,922.16, All this stuff is essentially once the verdict comes out is like.
922.16,923.16, Junk.
923.16,925.16, So what's the point of these are now?
925.16,927.16," Well, the point is to have fun."
927.16,928.16," I mean, that's the thing."
928.16,932.16," Like if you went on these raids and you had a great time and you got your tier two gear,"
932.16,935.16," well, then great for you, you know, but now it's at a date."
935.16,937.16," I mean, you have to, it was worth."
937.16,943.16," You know, and you thought you got the best stuff ever and now your Lord God King of,"
943.16,945.16," of wow, you were kind of stupid."
945.16,948.16," But let's say a new player is just coming in with Bernie Crusade,"
948.16,951.16," and he gets after the point where he can do those raids, like what would,"
951.16,953.16, what would he gain from them?
953.16,955.16," Well, you get the most uber gear there is."
956.16,957.16, But you can add that point.
957.16,961.16, You just said that there's relatively simple quests in Bernie Crusade.
961.16,964.16," So basically, which is the new, the uber raid quest."
964.16,967.16," The old raids are going to be, they're going to be deserted."
967.16,968.16, No one's going to do that.
968.16,969.16, Right.
969.16,970.16, But they're going to be like tone back.
970.16,974.16," So I guess what Ryan's question is, like, let's say you get up to level 60."
974.16,975.16, Okay.
975.16,980.16," You go take the original, wow, missions where, where takes you six months on these raids to get the stuff."
980.16,981.16," No, you would get the right path."
981.16,982.16, Right.
982.16,983.16, These raids will probably die.
983.16,987.16," What might happen is when people hit 70, they might go back with smaller groups of people"
987.16,991.16," and just try to do them for fun with like 20 people instead of the normal 40, but"
991.16,992.16, wouldn't they be any point anyway?
992.16,996.16, Would they make in a big deal about the ability to go back and to existing?
996.16,998.16," Yeah, that's only for the new, that's higher levels."
998.16,999.16, That's for the new stuff.
999.16,1003.16," Yeah, the newer instances will have like a lower version,"
1003.16,1005.16, and then you can turn the difficulty up.
1005.16,1006.16, Okay.
1006.16,1008.16, So that's something they're building in because of this whole problem.
1008.16,1012.16, One part that they're expressed to support the number is like some of these.
1012.16,1015.16, Some of the coolest dungeons are you breeze right past them like a level 40.
1015.16,1016.16, Like you go to them once.
1016.16,1018.16," Yeah, suddenly they're absolutely free."
1018.16,1022.16," But like, they're still cool and you have value and going back at them."
1022.16,1023.16, Right.
1023.16,1027.1599999999999," And if you go to the six, there's a ton of level 60 dungeons that people have been doing for the last year and a half, whatever."
1027.1599999999999,1028.1599999999999," Oh, no, over and over again."
1028.1599999999999,1031.1599999999999, All these other ones left are just less sitting there.
1031.1599999999999,1032.1599999999999, Right.
1032.1599999999999,1037.1599999999999, Some of the best dungeons in the game are actually kind of low be dungeons or mid range dungeons.
1037.1599999999999,1041.1599999999999," But once your level 60 now, there's no reason ever to go back to go far."
1041.16,1044.16, And then you have to go far and breathe through it with two people or something.
1044.16,1045.16, Just for the nostalgia.
1045.16,1049.16, But remember these days when we kill that troll by the waterfall.
1049.16,1051.16, And it's a great equalizer.
1051.16,1053.16, This is the whole expansion thing.
1053.16,1058.16, But like the people who are the hardcore raiders are going to be back on top again in no time.
1058.16,1059.16, Right.
1059.16,1061.16, Like they'll be the ones who get there first and they'll be the ones.
1061.16,1062.16," Yeah, they're all mad now."
1062.16,1065.16, They're going to be for white coding and they'll still be the first ones.
1065.16,1066.16, Yeah.
1066.16,1067.16, That's just what'll happen.
1067.16,1070.16, I think most people are just disappointed that like.
1070.16,1073.16, They're all their work is being ups right.
1073.16,1076.16, So fast about walking through the door into Outland.
1076.16,1079.16, I've been loving the people bitching inside the beta.
1079.16,1081.16, So it's like a half.
1081.16,1085.16, But he people want you're playing the beta for free.
1085.16,1087.16," Man, Blizzard sucks."
1087.16,1089.16, This quest is broken.
1089.16,1092.16," Yeah, maybe they should beta test it for a time."
1092.16,1096.16, I started using that line through that little couple of days.
1096.16,1097.16, Good.
1097.16,1098.16, Great.
1098.16,1100.16, People will complain about everything.
1100.16,1102.16, That's every and another beta though.
1102.16,1103.16, Yeah.
1103.16,1108.16, It's like raging at the gods being lears of the no cause like it in battle fields the same way during the beta.
1108.16,1111.16, And every time you play it's just like.
1111.16,1113.16," Yeah, it's grew dice grew dice."
1113.16,1114.16, Yeah.
1114.16,1115.16, I imagine it's the same.
1115.16,1117.16, It's got to be hard to be a game developer.
1117.16,1119.16, Blizzard personally tried to ruin their world.
1119.16,1120.16, Right.
1120.16,1121.16, Right.
1122.16,1128.16," You know, they're a little infective of Blizzard entertainment is if you go to their office."
1128.16,1132.16, And I won't say what their address is because of what I'm going to say next.
1132.16,1139.16," But if you go into their office and there'll be they have bullet, bullet proof glass in the lobby now in front of the receptionist."
1139.16,1140.16, Really?
1140.16,1141.16, Wow.
1141.16,1142.16, It's an effort.
1142.16,1143.16, What was it?
1143.16,1144.16, I'm not making the stuff.
1144.16,1145.16, Like a 7 11 shoe is to talk about.
1145.16,1147.16, Kind of someone's going to rub the joint or kind of.
1147.16,1148.16, Yeah.
1148.16,1153.16," Like I joke, because that like is that because of like angry fans coming into the nerve the shaman's and they're like, yeah."
1153.16,1156.16, They got in their eyes.
1156.16,1159.16, There's people get like this is the experience.
1159.16,1160.16," You know, I just sorry."
1160.16,1164.16, That's why I tried to quit the game and go outside.
1164.16,1166.16, What you're feeling to need to storm the office.
1166.16,1167.16, That's that.
1167.16,1168.16, Yeah.
1168.16,1171.16, I wonder how many this whole burning crusade thing is a reality check for like.
1171.16,1172.16, Yeah.
1172.16,1174.16," They needed something to just kick him and go, wow."
1174.16,1176.16, That was just a game the whole time.
1176.16,1177.16," Oh, right."
1177.16,1179.16, The interest danger.
1179.16,1180.16, Right.
1180.16,1185.16," I wonder if that was a collected effort between between the expansion and that South Park episode is just to say,"
1185.16,1186.16, Go outside.
1186.16,1187.16, Yeah.
1187.16,1191.16," So, but in any case, I've been playing it, too."
1191.16,1195.16," And I've, I have a level 12 to an eye right now."
1195.16,1197.16, I can't play outland.
1197.16,1200.16," I mean, it says that your level 55 up."
1200.16,1202.16," And I can't, I can't."
1203.16,1204.16, You're a expert died right away when I went in there.
1204.16,1205.16, So I need to level up higher.
1205.16,1206.16, Of course.
1206.16,1209.16, I did walk right right at the demons that no one's supposed to walk and do.
1209.16,1210.16, Right.
1210.16,1211.16, And I hit it like that decoration.
1211.16,1212.16, Right.
1212.16,1214.16, I'm just going to hang it in here.
1214.16,1217.16, This place has level question mark question mark enemies.
1217.16,1218.16, Yeah.
1218.16,1219.16, Right.
1219.16,1220.16, So I guess I was too excited.
1220.16,1222.16, But I wanted to play the journey.
1222.16,1224.16, And that beautiful new areas.
1224.16,1225.16," The, yeah."
1225.16,1227.16, You're going to get texture on the art.
1227.16,1228.16, There's is pretty neat.
1228.16,1229.16, Yeah.
1229.16,1230.16, I'm been playing the blood else.
1230.16,1234.16," Um, a rogue, an airplane of rogue in my life, is because beta is the opportunity to do things I never do."
1234.16,1235.16, Which would be what I'll grow.
1235.16,1237.16," Yeah, I'm playing a mate who had tried never do."
1237.16,1238.16, Yeah.
1238.16,1239.16, It's fun.
1239.16,1240.16, It's good.
1240.16,1241.16, It's pretty much the same.
1241.16,1243.16, Like the other new beasons.
1243.16,1244.16, Yeah.
1244.16,1245.16, Isn't your normal warlock?
1245.16,1246.16, Is that like the same thing?
1246.16,1247.16, No.
1247.16,1248.16, No.
1248.16,1251.16," We're like more a lot, I think you keep a pet."
1251.16,1252.16, What?

1261.16,1265.52," Yeah, this is why my wife wants me to get a new job."
1265.52,1267.76, She hears conversations like this.
1267.76,1268.76, How did I miss you?
1268.76,1270.16, Did she listen to the podcast?
1270.16,1271.16, No.
1271.16,1272.16, No.

1278.0400000000002,1282.44, Does anybody here in this room have their significant other listen to the podcast?
1282.44,1283.44, Anyone?

1286.44,1287.44," Really, would you?"

1317.64,1318.64, Geernaff for it.
1318.64,1320.1200000000001, So what are you playing now?

1336.1200000000001,1340.3200000000002," I mean, you know, logging in, running around a little bit, making sure I still"
1340.3200000000002,1343.7600000000002, know how to do all the good combos and things like that.
1343.76,1345.76," Well, you're practicing combos in Guild Wars."
1345.76,1347.76, I can't kill more of them.
1347.76,1350.76," Oh, dude."
1350.76,1352.76, There's a good attorney to a fight.
1352.76,1354.76, You see Ryan's getting up and I'm.
1354.76,1357.76, I gotta make sure I even have to play my character.
1357.76,1360.76," So you just like, you're in the environment to say, oh, oh, oh."
1360.76,1361.76, Yeah.
1361.76,1362.76, I can't do it.
1362.76,1364.76, He's the combos.
1364.76,1366.76, There isn't a combo in Guild Wars.
1366.76,1367.76, Just hit the number keys.
1367.76,1370.76," Just like four, one, three, four."
1370.76,1371.76, Tommy Man.
1371.76,1372.76," Well, basically."
1372.76,1374.76, Use yourself on for that or something.
1374.76,1377.76, I'm going to turn it off and press on the button.
1377.76,1379.76," And don't forget, he had text for the joke."

1405.76,1406.76, No.
1406.76,1407.76," Well, secondly, you're still playing Eve."
1407.76,1408.76," Your character is like, level up."
1408.76,1409.76," Oh, you're so playing Eve."
1409.76,1410.76, Right?
1410.76,1411.76, Really aren't we all.
1411.76,1412.76, Alright.

1415.76,1418.76," I'm going to start playing Jaws, on least, so I'll be able to say Jaws."
1418.76,1419.76, I'll be able to say Jaws on least.
1419.76,1420.76, Next week.
1420.76,1421.76, Yeah.
1421.76,1422.76, What about nightfall?
1422.76,1423.76, When is it officially out?
1423.76,1426.76, What is it live when you can start playing with people?
1426.76,1427.76, 27.
1427.76,1428.76, Okay.
1428.76,1429.76," I want to check, I want to check that out."
1429.76,1430.76, It's starting to new character.
1431.26,1432.26, I'm barely playing them.
1432.26,1434.26," Yeah, I do that every time it goes worse."
1434.26,1435.26, I like it.
1435.26,1436.26, I do.
1436.26,1437.26," I just, I can't."
1437.26,1438.26, Yeah.
1438.26,1439.26, I like to.
1439.26,1440.26, Everyone wanted to play wild though.
1440.26,1441.26," So that's right, Steve."
1441.26,1442.26, Yeah.
1442.26,1443.26, I couldn't get anyone into Guild Wars.
1443.26,1446.26," Like, isn't my normal game group?"
1446.26,1449.76," We got to have a serious Vanguard discussion at one point,"
1449.76,1450.76, gentlemen.
1450.76,1451.26, Yeah.
1451.26,1453.26, You guys got to have to have a discussion.
1453.26,1454.26, I want to create a very hard politician.
1454.26,1457.26, I like get us all playing Vanguard or something.
1457.26,1460.26," And we might actually have, I got offered to maybe have one of the guys."
1461.26,1463.76, On from the team on our podcast.
1463.76,1467.76," Because because they need, you know, we got to ask some tough questions here about that game."
1467.76,1474.76," Because it's, it's a, it's a pretty, you know, this is a very, very ambitious fantasy"
1474.76,1478.76," MMO and I think it sort of can be sort of like the,"
1478.76,1482.76," the bell weather for a can one of these games come up against, wow."
1482.76,1483.26, Right.
1483.26,1485.76," You know, it's a tough question."
1485.76,1486.76, I say the regular.
1486.76,1487.76, I'd be scared to fire.
1487.76,1488.76, I'd be scared to fire.
1489.26,1490.26, If I were them.
1490.26,1491.76, I'd be scared to fire to make it.
1491.76,1492.76, I love what you see.
1492.76,1493.26, Yeah.
1493.26,1494.26, I just know right now.
1494.26,1495.26, What you sort of do that's the problem.
1495.26,1499.76," It's just no like no one, I don't, I would like to meet someone who seriously"
1499.76,1503.76," put forward say, you know what this is going to outside of a cover line on,"
1503.76,1506.76," on a magazine that got the, the cover story."
1506.76,1507.26, I don't change everything.
1507.26,1509.26, This is really going to top.
1509.26,1509.76, Wow.
1509.76,1510.26," You know, all right."
1510.26,1512.76," I think the real question is, I don't even have fantasy MMO."
1512.76,1514.26," It's any MMO because I mean,"
1514.26,1514.76, right.
1514.76,1515.76, Any MMO.
1515.76,1517.76, Because others have come along and failed.
1518.76,1519.76, Second life.
1521.76,1522.76, A lot of buzz.
1522.76,1523.76, We can tackle that.
1523.76,1524.76, We can tackle that.
1524.76,1526.76," Well, we're just like, I want to hear more about not being there."
1526.76,1529.76, It's not playing because you've got got that you've got got the three.
1529.76,1530.76, Got got got the three.
1530.76,1534.76," I kind of put, I put, I put the e-brake on that one because I was running so many issues with"
1534.76,1535.76, dying on that.
1535.76,1537.76, Got the three hit that had the best LOL video of.
1537.76,1538.76, Yeah.
1538.76,1539.76, Yeah.
1539.76,1540.76, And basically I actually lived that video.
1540.76,1541.76," So that's, yeah."
1541.76,1542.76, That's a lot of shit.
1542.76,1543.76, That's a lot of shit.
1543.76,1544.76, So then you were done.
1544.76,1546.76, And then it's to tell people what that video and tell.
1546.76,1547.76, Exactly.
1547.76,1551.76, So basically one of the early missions is go out and kill some boars while
1551.76,1552.76, boars.
1552.76,1554.76, They're troubling this camp of rebels.
1554.76,1556.76, So boars are such a problem in these fantasy wars.
1556.76,1558.76, It's always the god damn boars.
1558.76,1559.76, It's not the boars.
1559.76,1560.76, The scorpions of the spiders.
1560.76,1563.76, That's how it's like they're a consortium.
1563.76,1565.76, So I go out and start trying to kill some boars.
1565.76,1567.76, And these things are freaking tough.
1567.76,1570.76," I mean, you tried to shoot them with a couple of hours."
1570.76,1571.76, I'll keep charging at you.
1571.76,1572.76, Fine.
1572.76,1573.76, They'll knock you.
1574.76,1576.76," If you die, they knock you."
1576.76,1578.76, They knock whatever weapon you have at your hand.
1578.76,1579.76, And you're unconscious.
1579.76,1582.76, And they're detect radius of solar dickies.
1582.76,1586.76," That like, like, the thing is, like, instead of you dying instantly, you just go unconscious."
1586.76,1589.76," So like, you know, he'll back up like about halfway."
1589.76,1591.76, And then just hit a button and you get back up.
1591.76,1592.76, Okay.
1592.76,1593.76, So I tried walking.
1593.76,1595.76," I tried waiting until this boars like way way like, you know,"
1595.76,1597.76, over the hill kind of distance from me.
1597.76,1599.76, And I get back up.
1599.76,1600.76, He's an old veer.
1600.76,1602.76, He comes from barrel in the back.
1602.76,1605.76," So audio, it's like the audio cycles the best part about it."
1605.76,1607.76, Because it's like when when's it knocks you down?
1607.76,1610.76," It's like, oh, you can hear that."
1610.76,1611.76, So let's recreate it.
1611.76,1612.76, Give me a few.
1612.76,1617.76," And then you, and then you click stand up and it's like,"
1617.76,1619.76," and it turns around and like,"
1619.76,1620.76, it comes right back to get you.
1620.76,1621.76," Then it's like,"
1621.76,1622.76," oh,"
1622.76,1623.76," oh,"
1623.76,1625.76, I'm so sorry to stand up again.
1625.76,1627.76, And it just goes over and over again.
1627.76,1628.76, I'm just waiting.
1628.76,1629.76, You can't.
1629.76,1631.76, You don't have your weapons because it's not your hands.
1631.76,1632.76," So you're like,"
1632.76,1634.76," punch in the thing, which is going to get you nowhere."
1634.76,1635.76, Right.
1635.76,1637.76," So so finally we get to the point that I would like,"
1637.76,1640.76," I was like, I was waiting for the Benny Hill music to come on."
1640.76,1641.76," So like,"
1641.76,1642.76, right around the left.
1642.76,1643.76, Thank you.
1643.76,1644.76, Thank you.
1644.76,1647.76," So I'm like, I'm trying to like basically get him caught on some piece of geometry in the environment."
1647.76,1652.76, So I could run back to where I have to like make a mental note of where it is on the map.
1652.76,1654.76, So I can run back and pick up my sword and.
1654.76,1655.76, Okay.
1655.76,1659.76, So bigger picture here because we can make fun of that forever because that was very funny video.
1659.76,1662.76, But that's so what what's the story now with God's degree.
1662.76,1664.76," I mean, is it it's actually out or you play a beta?"
1664.76,1665.76, I'm playing a beta.
1665.76,1667.76," Well, that depending on who you ask."
1667.76,1668.76, So playing European retail.
1668.76,1669.76, Playing European retail.
1669.76,1670.76, So that means beta.
1670.76,1671.76, So that means beta here.
1671.76,1673.76, Which is what that video is taking from.
1673.76,1674.76, Yeah.
1674.76,1679.76," So basically, I actually decided to stop altogether and like instead of continuing to play it,"
1679.76,1681.76, I might as just wait until the final retail.
1681.76,1682.76, Because we've been looking forward to this.
1682.76,1683.76, Yeah.
1683.76,1684.76, And the shame is it actually looks kind of cool.
1684.76,1687.76, And there's a huge open world to explore and things are happening without you.
1687.76,1690.76, So it's not like you have to follow a question.
1690.76,1692.76, Or is there roaming around?
1692.76,1694.76," No, but actually there's hunters hunting the boards as well."
1694.76,1695.76, So it's like if I don't.
1695.76,1697.76, It's hunting the hunters at that video.
1697.76,1698.76, Okay.
1698.76,1699.76, So yeah.
1699.76,1700.76, So that's part of the problem with the game.
1700.76,1702.76, I why I decided to wait.
1702.76,1706.76, But I had a good excuse to stop because Dr. Sya might magic showed up.
1706.76,1707.76, Oh.
1707.76,1713.76, So I will tell you straight up that the multiplayer is vastly vastly different from single player.
1713.76,1715.76, I thought the multiplayer is not out yet.
1715.76,1720.76, I played a beta ways back and I'm hoping that it's going to be different.
1720.76,1727.76, Because I think it's like one of the cool things about the game that I really dug dig is that in the single player you can interact with the environment and really kind of mess with things.
1727.76,1729.76, You have different ways to solve the puzzles.
1729.76,1732.76, Because the multiplayer is a lot of issues involved of course.
1732.76,1735.76, So that big hook right there is gone.
1735.76,1738.76, You can't really run with the environment like you can in the single player.
1738.76,1741.76, But I'm only a few missions in.
1742.76,1752.76," And there's a couple minor points where it's like, they don't tell you exactly what you need to do or you're not standing at the right cue spot to like have a guy tell you okay not stop that poor colors."
1752.76,1753.76, So like guys will die.
1753.76,1756.76, They'll just keep restarting an area to figure out what you're doing wrong.
1756.76,1760.76, But other than that it's it's okay so far.
1760.76,1762.76, I actually want to play it.
1762.76,1763.76," Oh, no."
1763.76,1767.76, I'm getting a little sign that we need to take a break.
1767.76,1772.76, So we're going to take that break and we'll be right back.
1798.76,1802.76, Hello and welcome to the one-up radio network.
1802.76,1806.76," If you know the name of the podcast you'd like to hear, press one now."

1834.76,1836.76, And we're back.
1836.76,1837.76," Like that company, Harold's game though."
1837.76,1841.76, And now that I'm finally done with the Don of Crusade.
1841.76,1843.76," He's our, he's our crusade campaign."
1843.76,1845.76," I can get back in the company, Harold."
1845.76,1847.76, Let me know when you're ready to play multiplayer.
1847.76,1851.76," At this point, you're going to be a dark wire me in dude."
1851.76,1852.76," No, I got other tactics."
1852.76,1855.76," Yeah, I got other tactics."
1856.76,1857.76, That's great for teammates.
1857.76,1861.76, You could be teammate or go up against one another.
1861.76,1865.76, What I got to find out from relic now is what's up with the next Don of War.
1865.76,1873.76, Because the Dark Crusade campaign ends with a little like five second teaser of the next Don of War game.
1873.76,1874.76, Really?
1874.76,1877.76, I can't tell if it's Don of War 2 or if it's another expansion.
1877.76,1880.76, We got a no and we got a no first.
1880.76,1881.76, Inquiring lens.
1881.76,1882.76, Yeah.
1882.76,1884.76, Do we have any copies of Don of.
1884.76,1885.76, Dr. Say of Dark Crusade.
1885.76,1887.76, I don't think we got him yet.
1887.76,1888.76, We didn't get boxed.
1888.76,1889.76, I saw him at Target.
1889.76,1890.76, Yeah.
1890.76,1894.76," The game's really good, but you know, like I said in the review, it's kind of like company"
1894.76,1896.76," of Harold's point five, right?"
1896.76,1899.76, Like it's definitely a step back if you're used to company of heroes.
1899.76,1902.76," Yeah, we wake it like it better if you send this more copies of the game."
1902.76,1903.76, So we get all fired.
1903.76,1904.76, Okay.
1904.76,1905.76, Guys.
1905.76,1906.76, Listen.
1906.76,1907.76, Dang.
1907.76,1909.76, Bitterness here.
1910.76,1913.76, No actually make sure Ryan gets a copy though because it's important.
1913.76,1914.76, Okay.
1914.76,1916.76," Well, we don't have to conduct business over the podcast."
1916.76,1917.76, There are ways.
1917.76,1918.76, All right.
1918.76,1919.76," Kids, get what we need."
1919.76,1922.76, Four more copies of Dark Crusade.
1922.76,1924.76, And a copy of Saints Row and a multi liquor.
1924.76,1925.76, Thank you.
1925.76,1926.76, Saints.
1926.76,1927.76, Saints.
1927.76,1930.76, I played a lot of.
1930.76,1933.76," I don't want to do a lot of, you know, console."
1933.76,1934.76," Oh, don't give it to that."
1934.76,1935.76, I just got to say.
1935.76,1937.76, Just got to say a play dead rising all weekend.
1937.76,1938.76, We're really good.
1938.76,1939.76, That's no more talking about.
1939.76,1943.76, And shut down.
1943.76,1945.76," Also, I like the achievements."
1945.76,1948.76, I look forward to that on Xbox Live.
1948.76,1949.76, Live.
1949.76,1950.76, We call it live anywhere.
1950.76,1951.76, When it hits a piece of.
1951.76,1952.76, I don't.
1952.76,1953.76, It doesn't mean anything.
1953.76,1955.76, But it's still kind of.
1955.76,1956.76, I like it anyway.
1956.76,1957.76, I really hate it.
1957.76,1958.76," You know, it's a whole."
1958.76,1960.76," It's a, it's a pressure situation."
1960.76,1962.76," All of a sudden, like, I have to worry about, like,"
1962.76,1965.76," like, like, like, when it, when it first came out, like it was in the"
1965.76,1968.76," morning contest with somebody, like, see how we go back up the score."
1968.76,1972.76," But I go on a trip or I come back and I have guys who are like,"
1972.76,1974.76," like, they're like, point horrors now and they try to figure out."
1974.76,1975.76," Yeah, yeah."
1975.76,1976.76," So all of a sudden, I'm like, wow, I really."
1976.76,1980.76," I feel that way too, because Scooter, Terren went over a official"
1980.76,1981.76, PlayStation magazine.
1981.76,1984.76, He and I got our Xbox 360s at the same time.
1984.76,1987.76," And now I go, like, go check his gamer score."
1987.76,1989.76," And this is like, 400 in mind, 190."
1989.76,1991.76," And I'm just like, I was sitting there last night."
1991.76,1994.76, Go and how does that jerk have like 200 more points in me already?
1994.76,1996.76," I was doing that with like, for what?"
1996.76,1998.76," Do you know, a costume's like, he unlocked that costume?"
1998.76,1999.76, I have to get that costume.
1999.76,2000.76, Really?
2000.76,2002.76," It's like the Chode Index, like, those have a..."
2002.76,2005.76," Well, he wants to, like, he or she."
2005.76,2007.76," I know, you're right."
2007.76,2008.76, There's a lot of other people.
2008.76,2012.76," Like, in a, in a simple episode, when we took the family"
2012.76,2016.76," to it, she and Scratchyland asked him if he wanted the"
2016.76,2019.76, by H.E. and Scratchy Bucks instead of regular dollars.
2019.76,2022.76," And as soon as he bought him and went into park, all the"
2022.76,2024.76," kids, like, this is a nice restaurant store said no H.E."
2024.76,2025.76, He has Scratchy Bucks only.
2025.76,2026.76," Really, really?"
2026.76,2028.76, It's pretty much like that.
2028.76,2029.76, I don't hear anything.
2029.76,2030.76," What is this, what are these guys doing?"
2030.76,2032.76," But I tell you, when it's on, well, you have a 360."
2032.76,2033.76, I do.
2033.76,2034.76, And do you not care about that?
2034.76,2035.76, I do not care.
2035.76,2036.76, I hate it.
2036.76,2037.76, I hate it.
2037.76,2039.76, I hate it.
2039.76,2040.76, I hate it.
2040.76,2041.76, I hate it.
2041.76,2043.76, I hate it.
2043.76,2044.76, I hate it.
2044.76,2045.76, I hate it.
2045.76,2046.76, I hate it.
2046.76,2048.76, I hate it.
2048.76,2049.76, I hate it.
2049.76,2052.5600000000004, watch him die and then they're boot you get we don't get a
2052.5600000000004,2055.6000000000004, achievement points if you don't do it like what are the
2055.6000000000004,2058.96, points for and like what do I get to get a shirt
2058.96,2063.28, or a piece of gum or something like getting like a
2063.28,2065.6000000000004, brochure or catalog for more things like it's been
2065.6000000000004,2068.4, my money not even you get your
2068.4,2070.48, point I'm like I know you get nothing I'm like
2070.48,2072.4, dude check it out I give you 500
2072.4,2074.8, shampoots right now
2074.8,2077.36, whatever I was like it's the same thing man I you know
2077.36,2079.2000000000003, when I first got it I thought it was a
2079.2000000000003,2081.2000000000003, point where the same point as the one you
2081.2000000000003,2083.6800000000003, got through a deem for like downloads so I
2083.6800000000003,2085.84, thought that would be cool but they're not
2085.84,2088.96, their separate scores yeah right because like
2088.96,2092.0, at least in you know like in an MMO you
2092.0,2093.6800000000003, get the points and you get something in in
2093.6800000000003,2097.36, 20 and 42 like you get points but then you get
2097.36,2099.1200000000003, something to show for it right and you're not
2099.1200000000003,2101.52, an unlockable right quick yeah something and so
2101.52,2104.56, at least you could say it's still it's useful in
2105.52,2107.12, you know yeah for the 360 more just like
2107.12,2108.56, pedal of you and just kind of like keep going
2108.56,2111.36, right but it's so I get it to testament to
2111.36,2114.96, you know like never overestimate human
2114.96,2117.92, psychology like I'll do experiment I think
2117.92,2120.08, it's completely worth like the hatch I'm waiting for
2120.08,2123.04, the skitter box experiment I create an incentive
2123.04,2127.44, without their actually being incentive and points
2127.44,2131.12, people if it's not persuaded people to buy more
2131.12,2133.68, games so they can obtain more points it's at least
2133.7599999999998,2136.7999999999997, persuaded many many people to rent games just
2136.7999999999997,2139.6, look at the threads that are around all you know
2139.6,2142.48, today when Sony announced that their
2142.48,2144.3999999999996, live thing wasn't gonna have achievements and people are
2144.3999999999996,2148.24, like it's a disaster I don't get points
2148.24,2150.0, it's no party for all my
2150.0,2155.44, five bucks yeah okay you're right you cured me
2155.44,2157.8399999999997, okay I feel stupid now still deep in the in the
2157.8399999999997,2161.2799999999997, 360 we are okay we are back in the back of the
2162.2400000000002,2165.84, it is coming alive anyway and that's the thing
2165.84,2169.44, uh halo this uh is the only place where you can get
2169.44,2172.8, halo to achievement points now for your account
2172.8,2176.5600000000004, yeah oh yeah oh that's got to hook that's gonna
2176.5600000000004,2178.96, sell this changes everything that's gonna sell
2178.96,2181.6000000000004, the next one this is the game that changes everything
2181.6000000000004,2183.6000000000004, okay so where are we at now
2183.6000000000004,2186.88, we are gonna do let's just brought it back take my lead and run
2186.88,2190.88, now we're back we're deep in the in the windous land again
2190.96,2194.1600000000003, we are right here is Peter questions how much
2194.1600000000003,2196.08, how much time have we got you well I saw the
2196.08,2198.48, retronats guys peering in the wind up but then they left
2198.48,2201.28, really so we just bought it right they probably wanted
2201.28,2205.12, a little over to get home yeah let's just go and Skype and
2205.12,2208.2400000000002, talk about retro games that were fun
2208.2400000000002,2209.84, you don't know that gonna get all days this is gonna be a
2209.84,2212.7200000000003, rum with Lexington GFW with CG again they're gonna come back

2217.6,2220.64, or PC in fairly more points than you now they probably
2220.64,2222.88, got more points than me
2222.88,2224.72, Darren you got nothing more for us there on your
2224.72,2227.36, magical list of my accounts okay I'll throw out a couple of
2227.36,2229.44, things that was something awesome okay yeah
2229.44,2232.24, here's actually something that if you turn the way back machine to
2232.24,2235.44, CGW's like MMO feature at six month feature we did
2235.44,2237.68, yeah we talked a little bit in-game economy is
2237.68,2239.84, according to an article from roiders
2239.84,2242.64, uh the government is looking into taxing a massively multiplayer game
2242.64,2246.64, content what okay what i mean let me read the story
2246.72,2249.44, and i'll tell y'all what okay uh representative
2249.44,2251.7599999999998, uh probably jimps okay for uh jimps tax and from
2251.7599999999998,2255.04, New Jersey is costing against exploring the tax and taxable status of
2255.04,2257.7599999999998, in-game items from an article and widers
2257.7599999999998,2261.3599999999997, uh the goal of the forthcoming joint economic committee study is to help
2261.3599999999997,2264.08, lawmakers understand the issues involved and head off any premature
2264.08,2266.7999999999997, attempt to impose a tax on virtual economies he said
2266.7999999999997,2269.92, under the current law sex and said if a transaction takes place solely
2269.92,2272.7999999999997, within a virtual world there is no taxable event
2272.7999999999997,2275.68, Dan Miller cheaper economists to for the joint economic committee said
2275.68,2278.24, earlier this week that the committee study would start with a blank slate
2278.24,2281.8399999999997, and be completed by the end of the year so basically by the end of 2006
2281.8399999999997,2285.44, they're gonna come to some kind of decision where may or the other
2285.44,2289.44, to what to tax what nothing well that's what that's what
2289.44,2292.7999999999997, well that's what they're expecting it's it's even come up
2292.7999999999997,2296.7999999999997, is because of second life in which case it just stuff the money
2296.7999999999997,2300.64, is an actual currency in that it's transferable to u.s dollar well it's actually a
2300.64,2303.6, couple of times that's where yeah so well that might be a
2303.6,2306.16, set of games but because of it because of the money game
2306.16,2310.16, because certain you know certain people in the legislature hear about that
2310.16,2313.68, and then they they're incapable of differentiating between that and say the
2313.68,2316.72, closed economy of world of warcraft or something where it's
2316.72,2319.92, completely not transferable it's more like you know right bucks
2319.92,2322.56, yeah i think i think that's the two examples of second life and so on you can show
2322.56,2325.6, it sounds good okay that you know fully their representatives like sex
2325.6,2329.52, didn't there to step in and say hey wait a minute like uh
2329.52,2334.4, i'm already annoyed that the auction house in world of warcraft takes a cut
2334.4,2339.6, you know i got a yeah i'm auctioning off an axe in world of warcraft and then you
2339.6,2342.56, know they you know as soon as you put the thing up for auction it says like
2342.56,2347.12, the cost is this screw you what you pay in for the fake dwarf behind the counters
2347.12,2350.96, like i think it's probably like you know because of the gold the gold farmers are trying
2350.96,2354.16, to find ways to pull money out of the economy that's all let's blame the gold farmers
2354.16,2357.68, it's always the gold farmer now we can have a first like big virtual
2357.7599999999998,2362.0, just get the virtual scandal where uh it turns out that it employee at one of these
2362.0,2366.7999999999997, companies was basically making was basically printing gold and selling it that
2366.7999999999997,2370.0, actually happened a while ago okay i actually actually happened with you oh
2370.0,2374.0, really back in the day and they actually found well what happened to you now go
2374.0,2377.52, yeah yeah wow i i i've well i forgot who told me this but
2377.52,2380.16, this from back in the day what happened was they would hire people to do the customer
2380.16,2383.6, support for you oh from base because they were all based in Austin so they're getting
2383.6,2387.12, like local college students to do the customer support so one college student
2387.12,2390.96, had this bright idea what if i were to like you know use my GM status to get these
2390.96,2395.2799999999997, sweet ask year and then figure out some back channel to sell it and turn around turn some cash
2396.0,2399.7599999999998, they caught him pretty quickly through doing some because they do like you know system checks
2400.4,2403.7599999999998, and over the years they've been like pre-opied some jail now
2406.3199999999997,2410.0, he's actually normally wouldn't say he's actually done sometimes even the death penalty
2410.0,2413.52, makes a lot of sense i think so yeah i mean when you're doing something like that
2413.52,2417.44, there's just no forgiveness there's none for that so that's just one example
2417.44,2421.44, people who can it real fried don't even go to jail like hey the dude from enron
2421.44,2425.68, what just got went to jail today what's his name is killing skilling skilling he was
2425.68,2431.12, convicted today he was convicted today so i read the newspaper rather than internet news
2431.12,2435.44, so i'm behind the scenes going to court today so let's have the
2435.44,2439.6, lesson to all you world of warcraft frauders you could end up
2439.68,2444.64, frauders you could end up in jail like skilling so is it going to be like one of those like
2444.64,2448.24, kushy white colored deal if you're going to be like or is it going to be like we're going to like
2448.24,2453.44, send you to like pause pause that'd be awesome what do you win for?
2454.48,2458.96, yeah hopefully he'll meet shellender there all right we're getting way off topic
2460.96,2464.16, but actually in fifty nine or something actually if you had a really funny story speaking a
2464.16,2469.44, second life i did you're mentioning how someone tried oh so yeah so actually i this past week
2469.44,2473.2000000000003, and wired set up an office in second well set up a shop in second life and they threw a
2473.2000000000003,2478.2400000000002, DJ jam there was the we see like realm the kleptones and plenic bolx were spinning for a couple
2478.2400000000002,2482.4, hours and Saturday so i couldn't make it i was actually enjoying some sunlight have you guys ever
2482.4,2488.08, been in second life i never have no yeah yeah i have yeah i visit all the uh because you were there for
2488.08,2495.36, year uh the red light of a two in the court to a nasty in there story i went up to the penthouse
2495.44,2500.0, did you feel like just a second computer after you and that story? no i just prayed that my girlfriend
2500.0,2505.76, wouldn't ask what's his game and then turn it off i didn't get any points or even even
2507.76,2513.44, yeah but yeah if you were you tell me like wow it's just somebody uh that i talked to over it
2513.44,2519.52, at quarter to three dot com my favorite gaming watering hole so that he had he had gone on the second
2519.52,2524.48, life for the first time and within his first five minutes he was offered a uh
2524.8,2529.52, a cool ratio right that a BJ right
2529.52,2535.52, did you cut it? it's even better way to a BJ honey cut yeah so i you know i don't know if
2535.52,2541.2, that made me want to go in there or not but whatever siding that sort of told me all i need but
2541.2,2545.44, in that second life well you could depending on where you're at i mean you could walk around and
2545.44,2552.08, you'll just see a bunch of like anthropomorphic bussy scones with like spank paddles and i mean
2552.96,2557.2799999999997, pretty much anything that's like i think it's like the house like my dream gets pretty much like
2557.2799999999997,2563.2, no browsing a google image with safe search off or you could put in any word literally like put in
2563.2,2568.56, whatever you know cake or something doesn't matter what you put in just like if you issue table
2568.56,2572.64, whatever it happens to be in front of you name a word put it in and you're not gonna like what you see
2573.92,2578.88, promise you that back that can be second life's motto that's like this i don't like what you see
2579.36,2585.2000000000003, google roulette interactive google roulette yeah but they go out of their ways to say that's not a
2585.2000000000003,2591.92, game it's right well because virtual world in the sense that there's that that a game is always object
2591.92,2599.6, oriented then it's not because the only object i guess would be sort of economic you know success
2599.6,2605.36, or whatever but then you could do just as fine without it you know i mean yeah i don't know it's
2605.36,2609.04, because yeah it's just because i mean there's so many i mean when you think of a game the first thing
2609.04,2613.92, you do to explain someone is what the objective is right if you insure you had to tell someone hey so it's
2613.92,2619.52, like what you play you know well the warcraft or you play company here is whatever what's what's that
2619.52,2624.08, about getting you would describe it in terms in terms of some objective but that's why it's always
2624.08,2631.1200000000003, difficult once someone says well what's second life right you just live in the environment so the
2631.12,2634.64, one thing that always bothered me about second life is that really that's exactly it's it's
2634.64,2640.88, it's an mmo with no objectives i mean you could do a lot of the same socializing in any mmo game
2640.88,2645.68, but you just don't have but you can make your own objectives and i think that's a life is to
2645.68,2650.88, it's credit wallets in programming terms it's just well there are many things you haven't an
2650.88,2655.8399999999997, avatar i mean you're like walking around in this world yeah i think it do okay it's far more
2656.56,2661.84, and i say this without you know any exaggeration it's it's uh orders of magnitude more
2661.84,2666.08, customizable than than an avatar and any other game and existence well yeah so the point where you get
2666.08,2672.32, determined like the color and size of your genitalia to like you have your big toe or whatever you want
2673.04,2676.8, you finally will you ball the side that is your ability to do it basically yeah i mean have
2676.8,2681.44, either purchased it from someone else it's capable of making it or do it yourself but basically
2681.44,2688.64, create your character from scratch so but then what you just in there you can make no you
2688.64,2693.52, can make you can make crazy scooters or like weird toys and you could sell those to people you
2693.52,2697.28, can have a shop in that sells clothes that other people can wear there are like many games
2697.28,2700.96, stuff right i mean yeah you can make many games like you could make a casino that's got
2700.96,2706.96, slot machines so i'm sounds kind of like sims online right but it's up instead of choosing
2707.92,2713.04, among specified options i mean i guess you can you really do create the content without it you know without
2713.04,2719.92, a template hmm all right now there may be another way of the warcraft inside second
2719.92,2724.56, people you can have their their virtual porn stores in there and you go in and they're selling
2724.56,2728.8, like videos that you would be able to that you bought in the internet or whatever but they're actually
2728.8,2732.32, like selling them so i'm surprised there's not like piracy claims within that game because
2732.96,2737.6000000000004, you pay for the pay linden's to get this in that anybody who rides a quit looking at me like that
2737.6000000000004,2741.28, like can i borrow some
2741.28,2747.84, it may have any 50 million underbelly of the internet quite seemy indeed i think 50 linden 30
2748.7200000000003,2749.92, makes makes me feel bad
2752.4,2756.88, you need some mark twain tonight or something yeah this is how we're going out of the market
