0.0,7.6000000000000005," Hello and welcome once again to the computer gaming world podcast. This is Jeff Green, the editor and chief of computer gaming world"
7.6000000000000005,10.96, and I have the usual esteemed group of
11.52,13.280000000000001, gaming journalists and
13.280000000000001,15.280000000000001, what the heck do we call you Scott?
15.280000000000001,18.0, My producer is puppy so that's about it.
18.0,20.48, Producer puppy. Yeah.
20.48,22.16, Scott. He's a producer.
22.16,24.48," Okay, whatever. Whatever that means."
24.8,27.52, And with me today are the following
28.560000000000002,30.96," journalists. Ryan Scott, her views editor."
32.08,34.56," Daring glass and I feel so, I feel so, I feel so weird."
34.56,37.120000000000005, Call myself a journalist. So do we.
38.8,40.16," Sean Elliott, it's or not."
41.760000000000005,45.04, You know right before we came down here that I was looking at the message board where we
45.04,48.72, asked people ask questions of us and one guy wanted to know if we could
48.72,53.519999999999996, separate all our voices by channel on a regular basis.
53.6,56.0, So that they always knew that coming out of their left ear was
56.0,59.28, Darren for example. I'm going to say no.
59.28,61.6, Can I come out of the subwoofer?
61.6,65.84," Uh, yeah. No. So they're just going to have to get used to us this way."
65.84,68.64, Yeah. Sorry dude. We're recording in mono.
68.64,72.48, Sorry dude. Okay. With that out of the way.
72.48,78.4," Uh, let's talk about a pretty interesting piece of news for early some of us that came out this week"
78.4,80.48, which was Apple's announcement.
80.56,83.60000000000001, Apple has never really had a whole lot to do with us.
84.4,87.60000000000001," Not for, I mean some of us like Apple but they're they're"
87.60000000000001,90.64, supportive of the gaming community over the years. Not so hot.
91.44,94.48, But the news this week was pretty interesting even to
95.36,99.28, gamers and maybe I'll turn it over to Darren to explain what we heard.
99.28,102.56," Oh, you mean the the wonders of boot camp. Yes."
102.56,108.56, So the the short version is if you can now play any piece of game you want in effect on
108.64,112.32000000000001, a Mac. So you're not slaved to OS 10 anymore.
113.36,117.52000000000001, So boot camp basically I mean that's the code name of a download.
117.52000000000001,119.92, Well that's actually well that's just the software.
119.92,124.48, Basically it makes the windows OS kind of like the Mac interface.
124.48,127.68, But theoretically the drivers are already in place.
127.68,130.24, So if you as long as you make a firmware update on any you know your
130.24,135.6, your Mac pro notebook or G5 or whatever you could just you could just install a
135.68,140.79999999999998, partition with OS with XP. So this is actually windows XP running on a Mac.
140.79999999999998,144.64," This is not XP running on top of the Mac OS, right? Correct."
144.64,150.95999999999998, It's just running natively. So that's that's pretty freaking profound after all these years
151.51999999999998,156.56, of not paying a bit of do that. So now those who have a Mac can actually play
156.79999999999998,161.04, all that whole history of PC gaming. They've been denied all these long years.
161.04,161.84, Should they want to.
162.08,168.56, Now I know that like actually in the office Jeremy Parrish from one up he actually did
168.56,175.76, some tests on his own on his new book. His new Mac was the Mac pro Mac pro.
175.76,179.2, Yeah. So he did his tests on that and it came out he was actually pretty impressive that
179.2,183.04, he got a half life two up and running you know you know what you know not high res is
183.04,188.96, it's a notebook but like 1280 by 768. Basically it's good to see you get on an on a PC.
188.96,193.84," Yeah. No book and like there was no hiccups, no extra downtime. We just you know the same experience."
194.4,199.36, So can we all just buy i-books now if you wanted to. Sure you could. Have they made any
199.36,204.8, test tops? Well I mean it'll work with us top. Basically any dust top that's using the
204.8,209.28, the new Intel CPU. Yeah that was going to be the big thing. Anything Intel based
210.0,214.64000000000001, will be able to they'll be able to split out the partition and you know have the OS
214.72,220.88, OS 10 on one and XP on the other. I mean in that respect it's pretty cool. I mean yeah.
220.88,226.16, So we don't need any stinkin uh PC or you know any Windows based PCs anymore.
226.95999999999998,229.76, Right. Maybe fewer blue screens you don't want whatever.
231.04,235.51999999999998, Well Jeff you're a you're a you're a you're a Mac user at home sometimes. Well not really.
235.51999999999998,239.67999999999998, I mean I used to work in a Mac and touch magazine but once you get out of that it's kind of like
239.76000000000002,245.20000000000002, when you quit smoking and then you really hate smokers. That's kind of how I was.
245.20000000000002,250.16, It's cool. Yeah I mean I was in the cult and then I got out and then I hated Apple.
250.16,254.8, And actually I've been kind of an iPod convert. I've really into my iPod but I've never
255.68,261.2, never wanted a Mac again. And part of it is just my my disdain for them for ignoring the gaming
261.2,265.44, community for so long. You know when it seemed like years and years ago they had a chance to really
265.44,274.24, capture that crowd. You know I mean what was Windows 1.0 if not just incredibly lame version of the
274.24,279.36, Mac OS you know. Yeah they they had the first graphical UI and then they blew it.
280.08,287.44, So the idea that they could I was reading a I was reading the quarter to three boards this morning
287.44,290.8, and there's a whole bunch of guys out in there now who are actually talking about buying
291.44,298.32, i-books and these are lifelong Apple haters who are who now see the last barrier has dropped for them
298.96000000000004,305.36, and the things that are cool about you know Mac products the the sleek looks and all that are
305.36,313.12, suddenly suddenly now are more than just I can't eat to them. Right I mean I know a lot of people
313.12,316.96000000000004, I'm on that fence as well. I mean like I've been like for a long time debating you know
317.91999999999996,322.32, Get it going on the apple side but there is no compelling reason because I can't play any games aside from a while
323.59999999999997,325.59999999999997, Sean are you gonna get a Mac now?
326.0,327.59999999999997, No
327.59999999999997,329.59999999999997, You know you don't like Apple. Do you?
329.59999999999997,333.76, Well you often know I have to use Apple for editing purposes like the rest of us here now
333.76,339.84, Show us thinking about the rest of the people in this building me I heard some excuses for why they use apples that it keeps them from playing games
339.84,342.32, So now I wonder if everyone is gonna be on a while
342.96,347.84, That's what I mean. But how does that even work for the Apple literate like video cards and all that kind of stuff?
348.24,351.68, I mean like some of the newer machines there they're using you know a ti cards and whatnot
351.68,353.68, So I mean it's not like it's not a huge stretch
354.4,359.76, I mean the have as long as I have the base level a t you know the Intel and a ti chips that they're good to go
360.15999999999997,369.68, But didn't I mean this is just speculation on my on my part it didn't the apple hardware just for some reason work better and faster than PC because the
370.32,376.64, OS was more into I don't I want to my looking for here because I know I remember talking with a couple people about it that that the
377.84000000000003,385.76, For some reason that the graphics were faster and and the the CPU and the memory just talk to each other a lot better on on the Apple machines
385.76,390.56, It was a history a relatively streamlined OS. I think that's been an argument for a long time. I don't know if those at
390.8,392.8, Point of the hardware or
393.36,399.44, Or the software I don't know I use my wife's eyebook now and then and I can't understand the finder at all
399.68,403.12, You can guarantee that there's some listeners just bang in their dashboards right now
403.44,410.0," One to correct us no please do guys. Let us know oh we're new to this world. Please help us. Yeah, we don't like it"
410.88,414.24, In theory if you can install windows on a Mac
414.40000000000003,421.6, Couldn't you maybe now install like macOS on a PC exactly? That's what I'm wondering too. Good grief. Why would you want to?
422.4,426.4, You want that nice frosty interface or being able to use quirky well actually in design
426.88,432.79999999999995, The only thing I see that that they have different is that when you use Yahoo messenger little faces come up when you're chatting
433.59999999999997,437.12," Yeah, Dallas get has that on his computer all the time. I'm like I miss that that's kind of cool"
437.91999999999996,439.91999999999996, Cool wasn't a word. I was thinking okay
440.4,441.59999999999997, All right
441.59999999999997,444.88, Move it move it on from the Mac no not even that word
446.47999999999996,453.12," Into other one last bit of hardware techy sort of news, but but gaming related is the evil that is Star Force"
454.08,456.08, Uh
456.08,457.28000000000003, Software whatever
457.28000000000003,462.32," Little mess up your heart. Yeah, well. We're gonna take your microwave. No, you know you're losing rights"
462.96,468.08, You're facing a libel suit. I'm facing a libel suit. I'm facing a libel suit. I can't eat the whole calling it evil
468.08,471.04, Some call it Star Force evil not me
471.6,475.44, There we go Ryan though. He'd be called me. I heart Star Force
476.24,478.24, Star Force for those who don't know is a
478.8,481.04, Controversial copy protection scheme
481.36,490.24, Found on some computer games now that has been alleged to cause mouth functions with people CD drives DVD drives
491.12,497.20000000000005, Computers in general and perhaps humanity at large. It's it's been blamed for all sorts of ills and
498.16,501.52000000000004, I think cancer too cancer right and
503.28000000000003,506.0," So yeah, Darren yeah"
506.24,509.76, But we now have something that we're we're calling the Star Force watch here
510.16,512.56, CGW which is we're gonna let you guys know
513.44,515.44, About games that have Star Force
516.08,521.84, That install Star Force on your PCs when you buy these games and maybe you know what I do that
523.28,530.16, All right well um for this week that the two games I came across my dust that I wanted to check out that I pretty much had an uninstall
531.04,533.04, Let me see there's space Rangers too
533.04,535.04, Which just came out and
536.0,539.84," I already have I didn't have an uninstall yet. I'm gonna give it one try, but there you go"
539.84,541.84, Thank you Star Force for ruining that experience
541.84,546.08," CSI as well. Oh, I actually I'll get to that in a second. Let's see the joy of CSI"
547.44,549.92, Uber soldier another fun one. I'm sure
550.72,552.72, He's gonna grace somebody's hard drive somewhere
553.2,558.32, And not mine though now why don't we tell people in case they don't know this first time they're hearing about it
558.72,561.92, If they install why why are you neglecting or why are you
562.4799999999999,570.0799999999999, Reluctant to install Uber soldier or well actually I could do this with the help of a new box from actually this is the the new CSI game
570.8,573.4399999999999, I was like holding up to Scotland as a camera here with the house around me
575.04,579.8399999999999, That's the other show yeah exactly so it's CSI three dimensions of murder and and much like it
579.8399999999999,583.28, This the one with 3D gameplay apparently it's revolutionary here in 2006
583.68,590.4, But they have the E you say craziness wow and they have this like surgeon generals kind of warning on the back and like really
590.4,592.64, Fine print if you read it upside down against a mirror
594.0,599.36, This game contains technology intended to prevent copying that may conflict with some CDRW
599.36,601.36, DVDRW and virtual drives
601.36,604.9599999999999, Basically it could screw up your computer if you if you if you leave it unchecked
605.12,609.92, So there's actually a warning sticker on this box now warning you that if you install this game
610.4,612.4, It may screw up your computer
612.8,619.84, Thanks to Star Force. Thank. Thank you guys really. That's great. Now this we have to say is I believe on every
620.48,622.48, Shipping product by
622.48,627.36," Ubisoft right and it's in this specific it'll be soft, but well, I let it"
627.36,631.4399999999999," I am so not getting any air the game now. Well, this is in case where they've got us by the balls"
631.4399999999999,637.12," I mean if it was anything else you know oversoldre that's fine, but this is CSI three dimensions of murder if we want to play it"
637.12,638.16, We've got to have it
638.16,639.4399999999999, Which of it
639.4399999999999,641.84, And it's not gonna want to play it so right we
641.84,646.24, But if I do find yourself wondering like is this gonna be an ghostry kind of advanced warfighter or is this gonna be in?
646.64,647.64," Yeah, I mean all of it"
647.72,650.1999999999999, It was in the heroes of my magic five
650.68,655.4, Beta that I was playing and that caused a lot of the screwups didn't it or well it didn't actually it didn't cause
655.4,657.4, Gropes because I wouldn't install it
658.04,663.64, I didn't want it on my machine so I wouldn't play the beta. I just I just have a problem with you know
663.64,665.64, It's like they know that
666.36,668.36, This software
668.36,673.8," Messes up people's machines, but yet they put it on there anyway. What are you thinking? Allegedly and then there and others"
673.8,675.8, I'll see there denying it
676.76,679.8," Well, you know now there's another is that lawsuit that's happening"
683.8,686.76," All right, I'll keep to I just feel like I was last section lost"
686.76,691.88, There you go. I mean like the guys behind that were prosecuting this are the guys who basically
691.88,698.04, We're going against Sony for for their copy protection on CDs. Oh the DRM is exactly the root kit. I was okay
698.04,704.1999999999999," Yeah, so I mean it's I mean, it's a serious business and I don't know it's kind of interesting because there are some"
704.36,706.36, I think we've talked about this before how some games like you know
707.48,712.36, Stardock they you know they they released right galactic sift two and there's no protection on it whatsoever
712.36,714.36, And still people are buying up on a truckloads
714.6800000000001,720.6800000000001," You know, I don't have a records today. Yeah, I don't have a problem with people doing copy protection"
720.6800000000001,726.6800000000001, I I totally believe all I get developers and you know developers artists they all she get paid for their work
726.6800000000001,730.2, I have no problems with that but when you start messing with my my hardware
730.5200000000001,736.5200000000001," Yeah, I've paid harder and money for or you know however I got him you know, I'm but"
737.24,742.5200000000001, I'm gonna say no I'm gonna sit there and look then go no. I'm sorry. I there's too much
743.4000000000001,747.96, Possibility of a problem with it. I'm not gonna touch it. I agree with you completely and you know
747.96,751.5600000000001, And the things I started going back through my old catalog of games that I really love playing like a
752.6,757.96, Silent storm awesome game Star Force yep and and you just you have to start and the thing is it
758.0400000000001,760.2, Install the stuff in the background. You don't even notice it until
761.0,766.0400000000001, You finish the install and it goes you have to reboot your computer now for Star Force to work right and apparently you can start
766.36,770.6800000000001, Telling that maybe something as wrong as if if you're noticing your CD drives slowing down
771.5600000000001,777.32," Access times getting longer things like that. Well, I mean that's one part of it. I mean if you if you I think if you like reboot your computer"
777.32,779.32, Friendly it shouldn't be a problem
780.12,786.52, But one thing I think that a bigger problem behind is it it leaves open the possibility that you know
787.0,793.0, It leaves it your your computer vulnerable to hackers and they can access like every level of your computer if they want to
793.16,798.4399999999999, Why you're there lately at just the fact that there's a warning sticker on a on a box for a game
799.0,803.4, Warning that it may screw up your computer. Why should we even have to deal with that BS? You know
803.4,806.68, I mean that's another reason to just get an Xbox and say the hell with it
807.24,816.28," You know frankly, you know, I mean they gotta get rid of that crap the Star Force guys the guys who make it claim that all these all these cases against it are the work of"
816.6,822.28," Delicious pirate groups. Oh sure. Yeah, well, they also claim that like Elvis is dancing on Mars now with"
823.96,825.96, Too Morris in and it's job
826.76,831.4," Yeah, these are the same guys who actually point on their forms pointed to torn-and-sites for galactic"
831.4,835.72," Syptoos you could download it for free. Yeah, that was a class that was a really classy hack there very"
836.04,837.8, The other thing they did was they had that great
838.36,841.48, Contest to disprove that Star Force did anything
842.36,846.04," Bad to your PC remember that. Oh, yeah, and you have to bring the PC to"
846.6,852.12, To the office which happens to be in Russia and so then when nobody surprisingly didn't show up
852.68,853.96," Yeah, to Russia"
853.96,855.96, Then they declared that sea
856.1999999999999,861.96," No one could prove it. Hey, Ryan actually. This is a great kind of law. Did you get me hate mail from your story that you wrote about Star Force?"
862.4399999999999,862.84, The
863.56,867.72," They threatened to sue you or no, I actually never heard back from the guy after"
868.68,873.0," Had to I first contacted him. Oh, you contacted the crazy Russian guy. Oh, yeah"
873.08,875.0, Allegedly
875.0,877.0, There was a big threat on their forums where
877.96,881.24, Some people were going back and forth about like they were trying to defend themselves and
882.6,884.6, Eventually got locked because everybody was
885.64,887.64, Just going off about how bad Star Force was
888.44,891.72," Yeah, and then a couple weeks ago they uh one of their their moderators"
892.44,894.44, Posted something about how
894.44,897.24, This other security company had done all these tests
897.72,902.92, Comparing Star Force against all these other coffee protection methods and that all these claims were
903.8,909.4, False and they linked to it and the thing they linked to was just like another company owned by the Star Force guys
909.4,914.36," Great yeah, well, I think I'm just gonna declare guilty until proven innocent with these guys"
914.76,918.36," Yeah, I just I will always look for that"
918.84,923.24," On there the the surgeon general's warning and if it's there, I'm not touching the game"
923.24,927.24," I don't care how much people say oh, this is the greatest thing ever not touching it"
927.24,930.28, I hope he's putting something on their box then they know something we don't
930.84,936.52," I think they should start doing a Star Force alert in our reviews. Yeah, yeah, automatically dock everything a star"
936.92,938.92," Oh, wait no stars"
940.04,947.4," Okay, so we asked uh we asked y'all to sending your questions and we got a lot of them actually surprisingly which means somebody's paying attention"
948.36,955.3199999999999, We got mail to both our mail box and the message board and there's not time at all for
955.88,960.76, Nearly all of yours. So if we don't read your question here today that doesn't mean we don't like you
961.3199999999999,965.0799999999999, Even though maybe we don't it just means that we couldn't get your question today
965.88,969.8, But there's a couple here. We picked out kind of general gaming sorts of stuff
970.6,974.28, That we thought we'd read in address and the the first one
975.24,977.88, Comes from Danish Viking 45
979.16,981.64, On our message board proceeded by 44
983.48,985.48, Who the other 44 are we don't want to know
986.92,990.68, But that means does that mean just to just to get silly and pause for me that he you know
990.68,996.3199999999999, It was registering county put in Danish Viking that name was already taken and he went again and he went again to
996.3199999999999,998.3199999999999, Dangerous like right three
998.32,1004.48, That's determination between 13 and 28 he made a skip so he went to Danish Viking 30 and that was a no go
1004.48,1005.7600000000001, So he kept going up
1005.7600000000001,1007.12, They let me at 45
1007.12,1010.5600000000001," Huh-huh, well, distance though. You know they do have long winners"
1012.8000000000001,1015.6," He had nothing else to do yeah, just saying right right"
1016.4000000000001,1021.44, Please don't send us hate mail for that. That was a joke. We love this is this is not the new Canadian corner and we love a Danish
1023.36,1027.2," Okay, so a Danish Viking 45 asked us some it's a multi-part question"
1027.68,1035.8400000000001, What is your this is directed towards all of us? What is your favorite genre? What is your favorite game of all time and what is your favorite game maker?
1035.8400000000001,1040.24, Designer if you could answer those then we would be able to understand you a bit more right
1041.1200000000001,1044.16, Probably not well I would appreciate it
1044.56,1048.16," That was him not me. I don't appreciate it, but but Danish Viking"
1048.72,1050.72," You don't want to hear what we have said no, I know"
1051.28,1053.28, So we want to start good. It's a good question
1054.24,1057.52," Hey, what the hell I'll start since you guys are I don't know okay"
1059.2,1063.2," I'm a RPG yeah, huh?"
1064.6399999999999,1070.8799999999999," Also first person shooter yeah, I think my most favorite game is Diablo Diablo and Diablo 2"
1072.24,1074.24, Those who get camps
1074.24,1079.36, We approve I wasted many many many an hour on those you're not alone no
1080.08,1082.08, Ryan
1082.72,1084.72, Favorite genre probably
1086.3999999999999,1094.8799999999999, Old adventure games like the Sierra Lucas art wins I miss those now a day that's probably games like like adventure games like beyond good and evil
1096.1599999999999,1104.3999999999999," So adventure games mostly yeah, I also I dig stealth action games too. There's there's not a lot of good one ton of PC though"
1105.9199999999998,1107.9199999999998, Do you ever say that again
1109.52,1111.52, Favorite game of all time
1112.08,1114.08, PC game yeah
1114.08,1118.56, Game pie the Tulsa ball world she talks about your favorite the yet game
1119.84,1121.84, What magazine is this you tend dogs
1125.6799999999998,1130.96, But my favorite game of all time is probably either salmon max or the original Gabriel night
1132.8,1134.8, Classics
1134.8,1136.8, Didn't even know you were alive for either of those games
1137.28,1140.3999999999999," Thanks, he got the wearers version somewhere"
1142.72,1144.08, Darren
1144.08,1148.08, You know I was actually trying to come up with like one definitive genre
1148.08,1152.24, I mean like I could tell you I don't like racing games is like the hardcore sim ones and
1154.0,1155.6, That's my like everything really
1155.6,1156.8799999999999, I mean I'd say that there's one genre
1156.8799999999999,1161.4399999999998, I like the fact that a lot of the genres are coming together now. It's common. I am copping out everything
1162.0,1164.0, I do I mean like I I
1164.0,1169.9199999999998," I play I love playing turn based you know games like silent storm. Yeah, but I also love first person shooters"
1170.88,1172.88, Are we ripping on CSI 3D
1174.0,1176.0, Is that some of the damn liar
1176.72,1182.4," What is I like everything I like every genre now, but I mean I do miss I miss adventure games definitely and"
1183.76,1186.5600000000002," She is all time favorite game. Yeah, that's a tough one"
1186.5600000000002,1192.3200000000002, That's that's a really tough one. It's kind of retro too. I mean I'm gonna have to I mean this is a game at probably like me and like five of the people heard of
1192.3200000000002,1194.3200000000002, But sundog the frozen legacy
1194.3200000000002,1196.3200000000002, I don't know this one. That's totally obscure
1196.32,1200.48," I just picked in this cuz of the obscure factor no, no, I actually I hit better than us no"
1200.48,1205.52, I actually I actually play this on an apple emulator everyone's gonna walk in the here and about fallout
1205.52,1210.48," Since what's it called no, no, it basically was like fallout. It was a good well fallout's a great game"
1210.48,1214.08," That's another great. You see, thank you pick the prank you on thank you for not withdrawing another one"
1214.08,1218.8," Now, no, no, no, so no, so no, folks like basically it was it was a space boundary TA"
1220.08,1223.28, strategy game action game that came out like
1223.84,1228.72," With almost like no graphics, but it was had a lot of cool stuff that's so wait wait"
1228.72,1234.3999999999999," So your favorite game of all time yeah, it's up there. It's like a little sundog the frozen"
1235.76,1238.24, That's great got the mud that and X come
1239.68,1245.28," You know, don't forget X come you know what the thing is it like it's very hard dance of this question really"
1245.28,1249.04, It's like it kind of changes all it's like saying what you feel like having for breakfast this morning or whatever
1249.44,1254.32," Right, then whatever it is like in my case, which I think I'll decide along team fortress"
1254.96,1260.56, For this there's always gonna be tons and tons of stuff about it that you hate in the case of team fortress the big flaw
1260.96,1266.1599999999999, Is grenades spamming or basically that every class has so many types of grenades both primary and alternate
1266.6399999999999,1272.48, That you get these cases where everyone just runs out into the field and empties all their their resources and everyone just blows up and dies
1272.48,1277.36, But that aside in terms of I just spent years and years playing it
1277.84,1283.76, Just really learning the engine inside and out and and to the point where you know
1283.76,1289.04, Aside from the various modes that it introduced to multiplayer shooting in general even the side things like
1289.04,1292.0, Conk mapping which is essentially a platforming type
1292.4799999999998,1297.4399999999998, Activity where a medic takes his concussion grenade and performs leaps with that
1297.4399999999998,1301.28, But so map designers would make these big skill tests that are all based on that
1301.28,1303.36," I mean, there's just so much to that game so much variety"
1303.52,1305.52, There's versions of football within it
1305.84,1311.36," Basketball, you know all these different things so for my money is when it was free for me"
1311.36,1313.36, So definitely a team fortress
1314.4,1318.72," Yeah, it's a great game and at genre to go out and to the genre question there yeah, it's a"
1319.28,1326.96," Type I mean like there and I like you know stuff in all directions, but I'd be lying if I didn't say that the shooter single player multiplayer my forte my favorites"
1328.8,1334.0, I guess for me it's probably a fantasy RPG stuff the most but also shooters
1334.16,1337.68, I've played a lot of shooters favorite game of all time in fact might be doom
1338.4,1343.2," Might be because that was the first game that really just completely scared the bejeeza set of me, you know"
1343.2,1345.2, I had the headphones on late at night
1346.16,1351.28, You know just played that was the first time I really got lost in a game completely
1351.84,1360.0, You know which other people have experienced another 3D game since but that was the first one where I was really in the environment and when things would come at me from around the corner
1360.0,1362.0, It just scared me to death
1362.8,1366.88," I am easily scared, but that's that's another problem my second favorite game of all time"
1366.88,1368.48, I think is probably a
1368.48,1370.48, CSI
1370.8,1372.16, Three dimensions of murder
1373.52,1376.88, Because you know what it has all new 3D game play. I'm sorry
1377.44,1378.8, I'm making fun of that game
1378.8,1382.24," But no, seriously, I could answer that question differently in a matter"
1382.8,1384.8, Different week I might say
1384.8,1391.68, Warcraft 2 or heroes of might in magic 2 that was that was a brilliant game the old fantasy general is one of my all-time
1391.76,1396.88, Pavrets going way back that was a spin-off of Panzer general from
1397.76,1403.28," SSI I think it was that was their fantasy version so instead of tanks you had you know, I don't know"
1403.8400000000001,1405.8400000000001, Giant armadillos. I don't I don't remember now
1406.5600000000002,1409.44, I think they also had a really cool like road warrior one as well
1410.3200000000002,1413.6000000000001," SSI yeah, I can't remember what it was called but I ever played that one too"
1413.6000000000001,1419.44," All right, let us know out there if you remember the road warrior version of I year on crack. I am not a crack"
1419.68,1421.68," Well, I am a crack, but"
1422.0,1425.6000000000001, So I hope we answered your question Danish Viking throw in five before we get to you
1426.16,1433.04," For a second container and have like Battlefield 1942 probably I love that too. Yeah, that's a great game. That might be in my top 10"
1433.76,1438.16," Top 10 would be easier than best of all. Yeah, that's the problem with the number one"
1439.04,1441.04, Yeah
1441.04,1445.04," When you ask well the Warcraft that I've to put in my top 10 now. Yeah, I'm sorry"
1445.12,1452.3999999999999, I think we just we're more more skeptical about the stuff we're still playing sure daily basis now because we just want to let us stand up like I'm close
1453.44,1455.44, 400 hours in Battlefield 2 now and it's like a
1456.56,1462.0," Theoretically I'm sure you know down the road that'll definitely be 400 hours. Yeah, that's kind of scary"
1462.0,1465.36," I'm sure that's the fraction of your world of work hours, but I mean to give you that"
1466.32,1467.28, How much
1467.28,1472.32," Replay value you get out of some shooters, you know, it's definitely up there and I don't all get out side each month"
1472.56,1479.52, We do we do we do we all do that actually that does kind of segue nicely into the other question that we were gonna read today
1480.08,1482.48, Which comes from Jason who asked us
1483.2,1488.8799999999999, I wanted to know if any of you guys ever get into a retro mood and play past favorite games again or
1489.04,1493.2, Try out games you might have missed from years past or do you just stick with the latest titles
1494.0,1499.2, That was a good question. I mean a lot of the times we are stuck with the latest titles because we're reviewing them
1499.52,1503.3600000000001, And we and we want to stay current even if we're not reviewing them ourselves
1503.52,1507.1200000000001, We sort of need to know it's happening to be oh cool haul
1508.0800000000002,1513.68," Yeah, they say but do you guys ever like to fire up yield games for fun?"
1514.24,1515.2, Well
1515.2,1521.1200000000001, So long as they so long as they work in XP I guess a lot of tweaking it goes on with the event they work on the macOS
1521.1200000000001,1523.1200000000001, I bet
1523.1200000000001,1528.0800000000002," My my even old game is recent your guys books, but yeah still play team forters will play"
1528.6399999999999,1530.6399999999999, Or crap to
1530.6399999999999,1539.84, Go on and make it because of course the few people that still play are all gods so we'll just rig up some cheap cheap ass map and tell them that it's like massive gold and instead
1539.84,1541.84, We'll put like a dollar in each mine and
1542.6399999999999,1544.6399999999999, Get them pissed off real quick
1544.8799999999999,1546.1599999999999, We want something else
1546.1599999999999,1548.3999999999999, I find that some games just don't age at all
1548.56,1551.12, You know if they're not like shooter first person stuff
1551.4399999999998,1556.72, Where the where that 3D graphics were like the key thing to me it doesn't matter like when you're playing a
1556.8,1561.44, Siv sort of game you know I just reinstalled heroes of might magic three which is
1562.32,1566.96, What five years old or something and that is just as good to me as it was when it came out
1567.3600000000001,1569.92, Did you get a chance to play around the new command and conquer boxet?
1570.16,1572.4, I didn't know how is it?
1572.4,1578.48, I mean it did it kind of stands up. I mean it's not like because there's some full motion video in there isn't there the cutscene
1578.48,1583.28," I mean it's just the cutscenes. This is true. Yeah, just so we can see uh car you were again in action"
1583.92,1585.92, Oh
1586.0800000000002,1588.88, Made that all right Ryan you just played all right
1589.44,1594.0," You just played ultimate like a last month. Oh tomorrow online. Yeah, I still played that"
1594.5600000000002,1595.92," Yeah, that's not old"
1595.92,1600.16," That's series. Oh, it's still current though, right? I mean it's still live"
1600.88,1604.72," Well, are you playing a run-a-run uo server or I'm playing on a fan today? Yeah"
1604.72,1610.0, EA servers and there's nobody playing on those anymore and I reinstalled the oblo 2
1610.24,1613.04, Scott's favorite game and that completely held up
1613.52,1618.32," Yeah, actually I had a conversation with Robert Haren our HD TV analyst for PC mag and"
1618.8799999999999,1621.28, That's one of the things we brought up. I'm like oh
1622.3999999999999,1627.6, Battle battle nets still up and running and there's 100s and hundreds of hundreds of people still playing that game
1627.6,1633.12," They still have tournaments. Yeah, all the time my 13 year old nephew recently asked me for a copy of"
1634.3999999999999,1641.36," Of Starcraft. Oh my god, you know, he's 13. Yeah, I would have thought he would have had no interest or he maybe even no gonna was"
1642.24,1645.84," I love the concept of that game, but I am just horrible at that"
1647.6799999999998,1650.08, Management of it and I always get trumped
1650.8799999999999,1655.1999999999998," Yeah, you definitely got to bring your friends to that one yeah, yeah, I'll play against yeah, otherwise"
1655.1999999999998,1658.8, I mean it's like how much of what percentage of South Korea's economy is based on that
1660.1599999999999,1665.4399999999998," You know, you know, try to try to very carefully online when you look for competition that game and you vaguely Korean name"
1665.6,1668.8799999999999," Donn in two seconds. Yeah, that's how I win. I just changed my name"
1668.88,1671.7600000000002, No Korean sounding name and it just intimidates them in the quitting
1674.0800000000002,1677.1200000000001, It's like you do you see you do some really stupid move and like they think oh
1677.1200000000001,1681.1200000000001," There's you know some kind of secret exactly. Yeah, some you know secret Korean tactic"
1682.16,1684.16," Okay, that didn't sound too racist"
1684.72,1686.72, The Kobe Ashima rule well
1687.2800000000002,1692.0," Oh, she is so I think we're dancing to the question. Yes, huh? We all like playing old games"
1692.16,1695.5200000000002," You know, I actually and this is inspiring. I think I want to go like try to download a try to"
1695.76,1702.0," Download rather reinstall interstate 76. Oh, yeah, I totally want to get back into that. Okay, so that's it what what would be the one retro game?"
1702.0,1705.92, The old game you'd like to play right now if you had time we didn't have to finish this issue
1706.72,1710.8, Just something you haven't played or you've been meaning to play again. Sim city
1711.68,1715.92," Seems like the original original yeah, wow none of the sequels were any better"
1716.48,1720.72," That's always the best one. Yeah, I think I agree. They mess it up with the water"
1721.52,1723.52, The pipes the pipes the pipes under the ground
1724.4,1728.72," I need to play system shock to middle offend some people, but I still haven't played it. Oh, oh"
1728.72,1730.96," Man, that was a good. I was a great game. Yeah"
1732.08,1734.96," Damn well, I'm gonna stick with i76 only because I haven't played it"
1735.28,1738.6399999999999, Graphically it might have probably won't stand up but still I got it. I want to just check it out again
1739.12,1744.32," Scott, what would you go play right now if you have all the time in the world if I had all the time in the world"
1744.32,1746.32, I'd go play fear and actually finish it
1747.04,1752.32, I think I can get past like the first to act of it if I ever get back to it
1752.8799999999999,1759.4399999999998," Geez, you know at jokingly I first came that just popped into my head because I remember what going over your buddy's house"
1759.4399999999998,1761.4399999999998, And this was like in the mid 80s and
1762.1599999999999,1767.04, He he had leisure suit Larry and passionate patty up there and I was just I
1767.6799999999998,1771.84, I saw like three or four scenes of that and I just thought I was the funniest thing ever
