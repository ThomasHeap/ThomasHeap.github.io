10.6,15.0," Packed with bare-knuckle brawling, lush interactive environments and a talking wood chuck."
15.0,17.1, It's the best selection you'll see this year.
17.1,21.0, Available June 24th on PS3 and Xbox 360.
21.0,24.0, You're listening to GFW Radio.
25.0,28.0, 97.5.
33.0,34.0, The Broveer.
40.0,44.0, Our dumb idea was to concoct absurd game designs.
44.0,49.0, And then opposed is what we call the product recognition group that we are calling the merchants of cool.
49.0,55.0," And to go outside of a Berkeley game store and survey people that were entering and exiting the building,"
55.0,62.0, asked them for a moment of their time to listen to these ideas and then give us some feedback on whether or not they're excited to buy them.
62.0,65.0, I give a second for a video game survey.
65.0,67.0, Give a second for a video game survey.
67.0,69.0, Like a marketing survey about games or...
69.0,71.0," Okay, I can't wait."
80.0,83.0, We're going to stand out for the store.
83.0,88.0, We didn't...we considered getting a land year and bringing a bag of goodies to give people.
88.0,93.0," Ideally wearing a suit is set up with a game product, t-shirt, tucked in underneath."
93.0,98.0," And gave up on all that, just dressed ourselves because we're pretty much game nerds as is."
98.0,100.0, Didn't take any extra work.
100.0,107.0, But we did get a clipboard and a pen and we produced some survey sheets that were with the letterhead on them.
107.0,111.0, Did all this stuff in the design so that it looked official.
111.0,115.0," So, we're from a product recognition group called the Merchants of Cool."
115.0,119.0, Basically what we do is we represent some games that are coming out really soon.
119.0,122.0, We just want to see what people are aware of them and what they think.
122.0,128.0," And so the game I want to tell you about is called Tender Rondo, the Sensitive Saga for the Xbox 360."
128.0,131.0," This one is called Tender Rondo, the delicate saga."
131.0,138.0, It's based on an anime which is like a Japanese anime series and it's going to appear in a cartoon that we're here in 2009.
138.0,142.0, It's about a highly sensitive and highly reluctant teen hero and Rondo.
142.0,145.0, And he's fighting the Kiljoy Corporation.
145.0,149.0, They're basically draining the world's emotions to power and do his statement by his.
149.0,152.0, He uses his hyper-execuated emotions to fight back.
152.0,158.0," So he's like a teenage boy, you know, super-sensitive, kind of, you know, like an emotive, big hair,"
158.0,162.0," and you know, chip on his shoulder and he uses his his."
162.0,164.0," His, yeah, exactly."
164.0,172.0," The way that it works is on Xbox 360 controller, of course the buttons are different colors."
172.0,177.0," So this color is corresponded to the different, emotional taxis has, like red is the anger, green is envy,"
177.0,180.0, and you can steal items from people that way.
180.0,183.0, Your sadness is blue and that's when you want to run away from a fight.
183.0,185.0, You don't want to have to deal with it because you got ready for it.
186.0,189.0," And it's got music by the composer here, Waki Tupotaki."
189.0,193.0, He does a lot of the stuff for the cartoon that we're animated series.
193.0,196.0," And that's about it for this one, yes, so what do you think?"
196.0,199.0," That one's down, but it's not critical."
199.0,202.0," Uh, so it's kind of cheesy, do you?"
202.0,204.0," Okay, cheesy."
204.0,205.0," Yeah, it's okay."
205.0,208.0," No, the title is like translated directly from the Japanese."
208.0,209.0, It's kind of weird.
209.0,214.0," Yeah, it just seems like the whole description, like key controls with his emotions."
214.0,215.0," Yeah, it's kind of weird."
215.0,216.0, Maybe for so few moments.
216.0,218.0," Yeah, I'm not that ready."
218.0,221.0," I mean, it sounds kind of like every other video game."
221.0,228.0," Okay, I mean, it's sounding like, there's going to be something you have to stop."
228.0,240.0," And it's, it's generally, it's going to be like any other sonic the headchallel type game or anything from like,"
241.0,247.0," and then you're like, you know, like, um, a giant big."
247.0,251.0," See, uh,"
251.0,262.0," This is the title, it's translated from Japanese appeal to you."
262.0,263.0, What's the title again?
263.0,266.0," Tinder Rondo, the delicate saga."
266.0,268.0," Um,"
268.0,271.0, I don't have strong feelings on my other about the title.
271.0,272.0, Okay.
272.0,275.0, Have you ever watched anime on the cartoon network?
275.0,277.0," Sure, probably a bit."
277.0,279.0, Has it affected you emotionally?
279.0,281.0, Sometimes.
281.0,285.0," Yeah, do you identify with your character Rondo emotionally?"
285.0,287.0," Well, remember the face the whole thing."
287.0,289.0, I could play this role.
289.0,292.0," I could get into those, those, those shoes."
292.0,293.0," Yeah, probably."
293.0,297.0," So what he's, he's trying to, he's not, he's trying to stop these guys, right?"
297.0,301.0," Yeah, he's a good guy. He's, they're trying to steal all the motion from this town."
301.0,302.0, Yeah.
302.0,306.0," If you could get a collector's edition of this game, which of the following items which you prefer,"
306.0,312.0," we're coming to a collector's box, a pair of fingerless ninja gloves, a wall scroll,"
312.0,317.0," featuring Rondo in a cherry blossom grill, or a CD soundtrack, my, cobataki."
317.0,323.0," No, the finger, the finger, those ninja drinks are probably, yeah, probably got the ninja."
323.0,324.0, Go.
325.0,328.0," I guess the, wait, what was the first one?"
328.0,330.0, The first one is just a nice box.
334.0,337.0, That sounds like probably gay and scammer.
337.0,339.0," I can't, I can't, I can't."
339.0,342.0," And we're just going to give you the description of a game that's coming out in 2009,"
342.0,344.0, and just get your opinion on the description we give.
344.0,348.0," So it's called duty calls, it's available for more or less all platforms."
348.0,350.0," Oh, that's the town that's going to be on."
350.0,353.0," This one's going to be on 360, a PlayStation 3, PS2,"
353.0,355.0, and then the original Xbox.
355.0,359.0," It sounds, uh, still make games for original Xbox."
359.0,360.0, They do.
366.0,369.0," Uh, duty calls, it's the first course of shooters,"
369.0,373.0," for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PC, PC, PlayStation 2,"
373.0,375.0, is it like a rib-off of a collodudier?
375.0,378.0," Well, it's, it's in the genre."
378.0,381.0," I think they're definitely trying to, you know, use that name back"
381.0,384.0," into their, that'll work in the genre, but yeah."
384.0,387.0," It's a lot like called duty 4, but there's some new stuff."
387.0,390.0, This one's going to online multiplayer mode with up to six players.
390.0,395.0," Um, and the features a new, an innovative new multiplayer mode called capture the flag,"
395.0,398.0," where there's, you know, each team wants to get a flag from the other person's base,"
398.0,400.0, and bring it back to their own base.
400.0,402.0, It also uses what they call a big tech engine.
402.0,404.0," There's a lot of first-person shooters like this, though,"
404.0,408.0," just have really small graphics, and then they zoom in on them."
408.0,411.0," In this case, they want to, like, basically, how would you describe it,"
411.0,412.0, what they're telling us?
412.0,417.0," Uh, well, from what I understand, uh, most games actually, like, they look normal size,"
417.0,420.0," but it's, it's small, like, small guys zoomed in on,"
420.0,424.0," and this is, like, life size guys, like, full size."
424.0,436.0, And then the other thing about it is that it allows you to fight in some of America's greatest conflicts
436.0,440.0," from the Bay of Pigs to the Panama invasion, to the bombing of Lydia,"
440.0,442.0, and then it does it one mission.
442.0,446.0," And so based on this description, what are your general impressions of the game?"
446.0,447.0, Sounds interesting.
447.0,450.0," Was there anything in particular that, like, struck you about it?"
450.0,454.0," That was, like, the, the one thing that you found most interesting."
454.0,459.0," I like the different scenarios, like the Bay of Pigs, and having different different themes of battlefields,"
459.0,460.0, so choose from.
460.0,462.0," So, what are your general impressions on this game?"
462.0,464.0, This is really cool.
464.0,465.0," Like, more action."
465.0,469.0," Yeah, it sounds a lot, but, like, like, cooler because of how you said,"
469.0,474.0," it's, like, more, uh, you said, like, everything's like, they hear it."
474.0,476.0," It's more, more, like, real."
476.0,477.0, Okay.
477.0,479.0, I guess I'd play it.
479.0,481.0," Like, call a duty for it."
481.0,483.0, Probably seems pretty fun.
483.0,484.0, Yes.
484.0,486.0, It's a good game.
486.0,490.0, Do you ever reproduce the big games on the Blood Ball Iron magazines?
490.0,491.0, You just on the back of the box.
491.0,492.0, Okay.
492.0,496.0," So, would you be interested in hearing more about the Big Tech engine on the back of the box?"
496.0,498.0, That would mean something to that.
498.0,502.0," In any future marketing materials or previews and magazines around the internet,"
502.0,505.0, would you like to hear more about the Big Tech graphics engine?
506.0,509.0," Um, not what it's not that interesting."
509.0,511.0, It's particularly to the small figures.
511.0,512.0," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
512.0,513.0, Yeah.
513.0,517.0," Yeah. I mean, I guess I would, I'd have to see it to get a better feel for it."
517.0,519.0," It's hard to describe it, right?"
519.0,520.0, Right.
524.0,527.0, Does it try to remind you of any other games that are out right now?
527.0,528.0, College.

536.0,537.0, Yeah.
537.0,538.0, Okay.

543.0,545.0, That I'd say your mom like buys the games.
545.0,546.0, Yeah.
546.0,548.0, What are some other games and the names of them?
548.0,550.0, It's too similar.
550.0,553.0," Uh, well, it's not my mom's just bad at games."
553.0,554.0, It's not really similar.
554.0,556.0," Oh, and maybe they're going to be a big one."
556.0,557.0, Yeah.
557.0,558.0, Okay.
558.0,559.0, That's a good one.

563.0,564.0, A flat top?
564.0,568.0, A flat top with a faith and shave stripes in the side.
568.0,571.0, Or just a helmet with a mysterious visor.

572.0,573.0," Uh, yeah."
573.0,574.0, Just right.

579.0,580.0, I've been surprised.
580.0,581.0, I think that's.
581.0,583.0, I think that the helmet would be visor.
583.0,584.0, You know what?
584.0,585.0, Yeah.
585.0,586.0, Joe Kruecker.
586.0,587.0, It's hard to slaughter Kruecker.
587.0,589.0, It's got to be like not as long as God will feel like that.
589.0,590.0, You know what I mean?
590.0,591.0, Yeah.

619.0,620.0, Lock and low.
620.0,621.0, Doody calls.
621.0,622.0, Sure.
622.0,623.0, Fire shooting.
623.0,624.0, Got some balls.
624.0,625.0, Online mode.
625.0,626.0, Baby best of all.
626.0,628.0, Big tech graphics.
628.0,629.0, They have a small.
629.0,630.0, That's small.
630.0,631.0, That's small.
631.0,632.0, That's small.
632.0,633.0, That's.
633.0,634.0, Another game is as you came.
634.0,635.0, It's called the place.
635.0,636.0, The Egyptis for the 10th of week.
636.0,639.0, This is title and the context sounds interesting.
639.0,640.0, Yeah.
640.0,641.0, Like this right here.
641.0,643.0, I didn't ever hear about this game before.
643.0,644.0, But I thought Conan.
644.0,646.0," I was like, I was wondering if that would happen."
646.0,647.0, Right.
647.0,649.0," So the last one there like, you did this and that happened."
649.0,650.0, Yeah.
650.0,651.0, Yeah.
651.0,652.0, You like.
652.0,654.0, So did it was the content is interesting.
654.0,655.0, So that one sounds.
655.0,659.0," The content in this though is if it's going to matter if Moses is exciting, he was Conan."
659.0,663.0, Because the place of Egypt retails biblical stories from the Old Testament.
663.0,664.0, Yeah.
664.0,665.0, It combines the ancient science.
665.0,666.0, That's right.
666.0,668.0, From a product recognition we're called the Merchants Cool.
668.0,671.0, Where you just can tell you about a couple of games are coming out next year.
671.0,673.0, You tell us that you think they sound good or not.
673.0,674.0, Got it.
674.0,676.0, The first one is called Plague's of Egypt.
676.0,678.0, It uses Nintendo Wii controller.
678.0,679.0, Yeah.
679.0,681.0, You ever heard of a game second wiki?
681.0,682.0, No.
682.0,683.0, What time a game is that?
683.0,685.0, It's called an adventure game.
685.0,688.0, It's based on the story's an Old Testament of Bible.
688.0,690.0, So like they have David and Galais battle.
690.0,695.0, You take this controller and you swing it around and then let go of a button to throw the
695.0,696.0, Rocket and the lie has.
696.0,700.0," So in this game, it's a big about Moses in the Old Testament of Bible."
700.0,702.0, And so you'll have him by his turn.
702.0,706.0, And then you turn the staff into a snake and you put the remote down and you'll hiss from the microphone in it.
706.0,711.0, And you'll shake or vibrate or like if there's you heard of the parting of the red sea.
711.0,715.0, So you take the nut chuck and you'll leave home and you pull them apart and smash them together.
715.0,718.0, And then it'll drown all the people that are in the water.
718.0,719.0, Uh-oh.
719.0,720.0, So one thing.
720.0,725.0, You paint blood on the door to keep the angel of death from coming and killing the first
725.0,726.0, board.
726.0,727.0, So you take the remote.
727.0,728.0, Splash it.
732.0,734.0, Splash it.
734.0,736.0, Splash it.
736.0,738.0, Splash it.
738.0,740.0, Splash it.
740.0,742.0, Splash it.
742.0,744.0, Splash it.
744.0,746.0, Splash it.
746.0,748.0, Splash it.
748.0,750.0, Splash it.
750.0,752.0, Splash it.
752.0,754.0, Splash it.
754.0,756.0, Splash it.
756.0,758.0, Splash it.
758.0,759.0," Oh, you're smart."
759.0,761.0, You need to downplay the religious themes and encourage the venture game
761.0,762.0, with all types.
762.0,765.0, So they want to be a fun game no matter what.
765.0,769.0," So based on that, what are your general impressions of the game?"
769.0,775.0," Um, I think that I will see Emma High School teacher."
775.0,780.0, So I think that my the boys I teach would be really excited about it.
780.0,783.0, I don't tend to play video games very much.
783.0,786.0, But I suppose if I did that might be fun.
786.0,789.0, Do you think the inspirational message would deter you from playing?
789.0,793.0," Yeah, I think the inspirational message would deter you from playing."
793.0,795.0," No, not necessarily."
795.0,804.0," So based on that, you think the game sounds cool?"
804.0,809.0," Yeah, because most of the games coming out now are really involving movements."
809.0,810.0," Yeah, like, like, don't involve us."
810.0,811.0, Splash it.
811.0,812.0, Splash it.
812.0,818.0, And I think it's the whole idea of the like using the we remote to do stuff like that.
818.0,822.0," A lot of the games just more of a, but it's more like kind of like,"
822.0,826.0," like, I think that's more movement stuff they could do to better."
826.0,827.0, Yeah.
827.0,831.0," Um, and could you imagine if being used as a teaching tool in Sunday or public schools?"
831.0,833.0, Do they use the passion of the Christ?
833.0,834.0," I mean, that was that going to remove you."
834.0,836.0, But I got a lot of people back in the church.
836.0,837.0, Right.
837.0,838.0, That's true.
838.0,842.0, So do you think that the inspirational message would deter you from playing?
842.0,845.0," Or is it like sound fun enough, whether or not you know about Moses?"
845.0,849.0," Well, I would say it's not really if I was going to buy that, probably."
849.0,854.0," Well, I don't think the inspirational thing would really make me not want to buy it."
854.0,855.0, Okay.
855.0,859.0, Do you think that maybe your grandmother might buy it for you for Christmas?
859.0,860.0, Probably.
860.0,861.0, It's a movie.
861.0,862.0, For a week.
862.0,863.0," Oh, wait."
863.0,864.0, I don't think that.
864.0,865.0," If I had a happy week, I would."
865.0,866.0, Okay.
866.0,867.0, I'm not feeling like grandma would buy it.
867.0,871.0," Um, I'm not sure my grandma would buy it, but my, um,"
871.0,872.0," Oh, right."
872.0,877.0," Uncle is, yes, I'm, he believes in old testing terms."
877.0,878.0, Okay.
878.0,883.0, How about this?
883.0,888.0, This game's fun.
888.0,889.0, This is a lot less serious.
889.0,891.0, It's called Wallcart.
891.0,894.0," And it's, it's so only a Walmart store."
894.0,898.0," And the whole thing is it's like racing on parts, except it's not normal good parts."
898.0,903.0," It's like really overweight people on little power carts to, and they're driving around"
903.0,904.0, and the tracks through this stuff.
904.0,905.0, They're like slow.
905.0,906.0, It's self.
906.0,907.0, Yeah.
907.0,909.0," Well, they're pretty fast carts with the people are really big."
909.0,910.0," And the game, they're, they're pretty fast."
910.0,912.0, And what they're trying to do is pick up items.
912.0,917.0," So it's like, everyone has their own course because you can choose, like, if you want to get, you know,"
917.0,920.0, the adult diapers first or if you want to go get the cereal.
920.0,921.0, So you get to choose that.
921.0,925.0," And then there's this one part in each, each person has to pick one hard to get item."
925.0,928.0, And that's what they have to stand up in the cart to get it off the top shelf.
928.0,933.0," So with the DS, they take the stylus and swing it back and forth a whole bunch of the screen."
933.0,935.0, And in order to reach up and get that top item.
935.0,938.0, So it's about these fact guys on parts.
938.0,940.0, You try to get something set of Walmart kind of.
940.0,941.0," Yeah, and they're really back."
941.0,942.0," They're, they're, they're getting to do it."
955.0,962.0," You, you teach any history."
962.0,965.0, Sometimes this is a good one.
965.0,968.0," This one's, this is a fun game."
968.0,971.0," It's called Founding Fighters, the Battle for the Constitution."
971.0,972.0, Okay.
972.0,976.0, And so it's like an arcade fighting game like Streetfire or Mortal Kombat.
976.0,977.0, Uh-huh.
977.0,980.0, But featuring the delegates to the 7th and 8th set of Constitution.
980.0,981.0, Uh-huh.
981.0,984.0," So you fight like, like, tech and, like, tech and game."
984.0,986.0," Like, been Franklin versus Thomas Jefferson's over."
986.0,990.0," It's supposed to be, it's supposed to be like an education game."
990.0,993.0," Like, on the terms of like kids like today, you know, like..."
993.0,994.0, Stench rights.
994.0,998.0," Yeah, it's actually, it's like, the Federalist versus the Anti-Federalist."
998.0,999.0, That's right.
999.0,1000.0, They're in Philadelphia.
1000.0,1001.0, They're in the Constitution.
1001.0,1002.0, That's what I'm going to do.
1002.0,1004.0," I'm putting you sleep, talking right now."
1004.0,1008.0, Even if you knew that it has moves such as Alexander Hamilton's Nicarbacher Schocker
1008.0,1010.0, and the Philadelphia Philobuster.
1010.0,1012.0," Free game online, maybe."
1012.0,1013.0, Okay.
1013.0,1014.0, Okay.
1014.0,1028.0," Founding fighters, it turns out, it's real."
1028.0,1033.0," After the fact, we found out that wide load games is trademarked this very name for a fourth"
1033.0,1034.0, common game.
1034.0,1037.0," As no relation to ours, actually, this was just total coincidence."
1037.0,1039.0, We didn't know until after we taped this segment.
1039.0,1042.0, And after we had our meeting and figured out what these games were going to be.
1042.0,1048.0," But, but, but, but, but if, if anyone in Wyblad is listening, I implore you to please include"
1048.0,1053.0, the Nicarbacher Schocker or the Philadelphia Philobuster as a move in your game.
1053.0,1057.0, We've obviously done some of the hard work it takes to create a game.
1057.0,1060.0, And we don't mind if you want to take a little bit of that.
1060.0,1061.0, We'll be flattered.
1061.0,1066.0, Would you prefer the title to found in fighters or the fighting fathers?
1066.0,1068.0," Founding fighters, can't say."
1068.0,1069.0, Okay.
1069.0,1072.0," But if you have a fight with fighters, no fighting fathers, sounds like you know, be like,"
1072.0,1073.0, if you're dead.
1073.0,1077.0," Yeah, like you said, and like you're a little hockey game or something."
1077.0,1082.0," Would you, if you had to give it a use for based on your current knowledge, what would you give it out?"
1082.0,1083.0, One to ten.
1083.0,1084.0, Eight.
1084.0,1094.0, One of the ideas they have is that players can sometimes they do it on attack that puts up a historical
1094.0,1096.0, document on the right side of the screen.
1096.0,1100.0, And they have to scroll through it and read it to get it off the screen.
1100.0,1104.0," Meanwhile, the player who did it to him gets to do attack him, do combos on him."
1104.0,1106.0, You think that sounds cool or is that?
1106.0,1107.0, Yeah.
1107.0,1108.0," They mean, I don't really get the hard stuff."
1108.0,1112.0," Like, it's like a punishment, like if you, if you're like,"
1112.0,1114.0," you're like, something in their face, read it."
1114.0,1115.0, Yeah.
1115.0,1116.0, Yeah.
1116.0,1117.0, And then they're like distracted.
1117.0,1119.0," They can even, you know, beat you up because they're learning history."
1119.0,1121.0, How do you make sure that they've beat it?
1121.0,1122.0, Do you like?
1122.0,1124.0, Because they have to scroll through the screen.
1124.0,1131.0," So, well, another thing is often in a lot of those games, it seems like people speak and say things."
1131.0,1132.0, Right.
1132.0,1138.0," So if you could incorporate sort of the general philosophies of the founding delicates into their dialogue,"
1138.0,1141.0, like they're just general dialogue and it was out loud.
1141.0,1145.0," And the story has opposed to just, well, because a lot of students don't have so"
1145.0,1150.0," our information as well if they made it themselves, then if I hear it."
1150.0,1156.0," So like, special news that are involved with, like, their different sides, like Alexander Hamilton,"
1156.0,1159.0," you know, like, hits people with the Federalist papers or something."
1159.0,1160.0, Sure.
1160.0,1163.0," Or like John, what, what's his name?"
1163.0,1165.0," Not John Adams, actually."
1165.0,1167.0," Who is the, with the big signature?"
1167.0,1168.0, Thank you.
1168.0,1169.0, Thank you.
1173.0,1175.0," I don't, I can't believe I don't have that."
1175.0,1177.0," People really, I remember, like, making it look cool."
1177.0,1182.0," They wanted, they wanted self-tape public schools, they want to get, like, whole place to play it."
1182.0,1183.0, Wow.
1183.0,1184.0, Yeah.
1184.0,1187.0," They're going to be like a e-game or it's like a little bit more cartoonier,"
1187.0,1190.0," or is it going to be a, that's, that's what we want to ask you, what you would prefer."
1190.0,1192.0," Because they're actually going to be like, usually realist."
1192.0,1193.0, Yeah.
1193.0,1194.0, I just want to be realistic.
1194.0,1197.0," I think it should be like, he don't make it happen."
1197.0,1199.0," Yeah, because they have one, one move."
1199.0,1202.0," Like, like, adventurous, like, flying a kite, right?"
1202.0,1205.0," And then he brings the kite down and it gets hit by lightning and electric,"
1205.0,1209.0," you know, the wraps around the neck of the other player and the electric keys."
1209.0,1212.0, And then it cuts their head right off with the kite screen.
1212.0,1213.0, So it's pretty pretty.
1213.0,1215.0, That's that's that's yeah.
1215.0,1217.0, Maybe you can watch the day next.
1223.0,1229.0," We can further the game be violent, like, more to combat, or to know more, like, smash brothers."
1230.0,1234.0," Smash brothers is like, if it's, if it's going to be told, no, like smashers is going to be like,"
1234.0,1237.0, I'd have it as a four-player game.
1237.0,1238.0, Uh-huh.
1238.0,1245.0," And then, you know, I have it like interactive environments, stuff like that, stuff moves, like,"
1245.0,1250.0," have it on the boat for the, like, the Boston Tea Party, so like that."
1250.0,1252.0," Ah, okay. That's a cool idea."
1252.0,1255.0," If you were to play, would you choose the amphitheater list or the federal side?"
1255.0,1256.0, Um.
1257.0,1263.0, We're looking who to make the bad guys in the box because they don't want it to just seem like it's a bunch of frames.
1263.0,1266.0, I would probably try both.
1266.0,1267.0, Okay.
1267.0,1269.0, Just for fun.
1269.0,1273.0," If you were to pick right now, would you choose to play on the federal side or the amphitheater"
1273.0,1274.0, or the side?
1274.0,1276.0," Antitheater is, I don't know."
1276.0,1277.0, I'm okay with it.
1277.0,1278.0, All right.
1278.0,1279.0, Okay.
1279.0,1280.0, I think the side is okay.
1280.0,1283.0, Anything in particular about the anti-federalist that is appealing?
1283.0,1284.0, No.
1284.0,1286.0, I'm just anti-fight the man.
1286.0,1287.0, All right.
1287.0,1290.0, So what are your impressions of this one?
1290.0,1291.0, Um.
1291.0,1298.0," Well, I am worried perhaps about the historical accuracy of the delegates fighting"
1298.0,1300.0, it out-sweet federal style.
1300.0,1308.0, I imagine that it might get quite a few kids interested in the development of the constitution
1308.0,1311.0, that wouldn't otherwise perhaps be so excited.
1311.0,1313.0," So, let's go."
1313.0,1316.0, Okay.
1316.0,1319.0, Okay.
1319.0,1321.0, Okay.
1321.0,1323.0, Okay.
1323.0,1325.0, Okay.
1325.0,1327.0, Okay.
1327.0,1329.0, Okay.
1329.0,1331.0, Okay.
1331.0,1333.0, Okay.
1333.0,1335.0, Okay.
1335.0,1337.0, Okay.
1337.0,1339.0, Okay.
1339.0,1341.0, Okay.
1341.0,1343.0, Okay.
1343.0,1351.0," So, for this game, the other thing to know about it is that each of these characters has"
1351.0,1352.0," got, it's not all learning."
1352.0,1356.0, They have moves like Alex and her Hamilton has got.
1356.0,1360.0, He's got a new Krabacher shocker.
1360.0,1361.0, Okay.
1361.0,1364.0, So based on this.
1364.0,1366.0," So, what are you saying?"
1366.0,1368.0, I'm so nervous.
1368.0,1370.0, I'm so nervous.
1370.0,1372.0, I'm so nervous.
1372.0,1374.0," So, so."
1374.0,1375.0, So.
1375.0,1378.0, What are your general impressions of the game based on the description?
1378.0,1380.0, Sounds pretty like stupid and funny.
1380.0,1382.0, Here's something like that.
1396.0,1418.0, Okay.
1418.0,1423.0," The merchants of cool were Sean Elliott and Robert Ashley, with mission critical bullet points"
1423.0,1425.0, by Anthony Geigegos.
1425.0,1447.0," This summer 2000 market test sizzle clip was edited by Robert Ashley for the exclusive use of our clients, with music by I come to Shanghai."
1447.0,1452.0," As GFW radio's usual host, Jeff Green would say, hello and welcome."
1452.0,1455.0, This isn't the new face of GFW radio.
1455.0,1462.0, Jeff has gone on vacation for another three weeks and we decided to do things a little differently for that time rather than just have two or three of us.
1462.0,1467.0, Meet in a room and carry on as though our great and beloved father Jeff was not with us.
1467.0,1470.0," So, Sean Maloy has left us."
1470.0,1476.0," We still can't announce where he's gone, which leaves us in Robert's bedroom out here in Berkeley."
1476.0,1480.0, So obviously we have Robert Ashley with us in Anthony Geigegos.
1480.0,1489.0," So the first thing you need to know about this is that as we stood for hours and hours out front of this game stop, this is a downtown Berkeley game stop."
1489.0,1495.0," And if we were wondering, you know, if an employee was going to come out and ask us what we were doing or ask us to leave even worse."
1495.0,1502.0," But then when first, a homeless guy comes up with a shopping cart full of recyclable cans and bottles."
1502.0,1509.0, And he parks that right in front of the door and goes in and then proceeds to play on the the weaky ask for about half an hour.
1509.0,1511.0, We knew it was probably cool.
1511.0,1521.0," And then when 10 minutes after he goes in, a homeless woman comes in with a hand cart and it's just loaded as you know, as they typically are when you're homeless."
1521.0,1525.0," You know, you have only so much space to hear your father's hands with you know."
1525.0,1531.0," And she brings her cart inside, but instead of playing, which is totally cool, I was like, hey, what else are you doing?"
1531.0,1538.0," But she just starts petroleum aisles like going around the eye, you know, you've been in a game stop that we're not talking about like, you know, big lots or something."
1538.0,1542.0," She's going around to these tiny ass aisles with their cart, doing God knows what."
1542.0,1546.0," So at that point, I think we were pretty comfortable doing whatever we wanted."
1546.0,1555.0," Yeah, and we never, we never really were approached by by the man at EB games, but we did catch a lot of people coming out."
1555.0,1560.0," Most of which did not really want to talk to us, especially the adults, people were too busy."
1560.0,1567.0," But we got a lot of kids. This is down to you. This is downtown Berkeley because I mean when you get off, you get out of your car, you get off of the barter or something."
1567.0,1573.0," First thing you do, you like, you look straight ahead and you put blinders on because someone's going to be asking you for something every two minutes."
1573.0,1577.0, And or just like bugging you or something is going to be going on that you don't want to see.
1577.0,1582.0," Hell, the last two times, you know, Anthony and I went down there to eat what we saw someone getting arrested on one corner."
1582.0,1584.0, And million people asking you for cigarettes.
1584.0,1589.0," And what happened the whole time we were like, like, every time Sean lit a cigarette and downtown Berkeley, someone asked him for what?"
1589.0,1593.0, And I don't want you to let it in there was just.
1593.0,1594.0, What's the thought?
1594.0,1595.0, What's the thought?
1595.0,1596.0, It's not in door smoking.
1596.0,1598.0, This is awful.
1598.0,1601.0," It means you talk about your bathroom, your bathroom, experiment."
1601.0,1606.0," You talk about like what burritos are like burning your your bowels every day, but you can't tell."
1606.0,1607.0, I said no.
1607.0,1608.0, Okay.
1608.0,1610.0, All right.
1610.0,1613.0," Well, anyway, Sean was drinking a lot of coke."
1613.0,1617.0," Some people kept on coming by saying, hey, can I have a sip of that coke and Sean's like, sure."
1617.0,1622.0," And I was like, wow, I didn't know, you know, you were giving out tips of coke like that all the time."
1622.0,1627.0," Okay, cheers."
1627.0,1629.0," But yeah, that was the deal."
1629.0,1635.0," We went to another location for one take down the street, which is funny because, you know, couple two miles away or something."
1635.0,1637.0, And the change was dramatic.
1637.0,1646.0," We go from having to cost people say, hey, do you have a minute, you know, regretting that we didn't have a bag of free stuff to hand out to and tie some to talk to us for like five minutes to."
1646.0,1654.0," We didn't even have people who walked by us and they were like begging us to approach them, you know, like outside this other store, they would basically come up to us and stare at us, wait for us to say something."
1654.0,1657.0," Yeah, well, it's just the difference in being in the in the birds."
1657.0,1661.0," Like, yeah, maybe they thought you were going to give them free shit, the right result of it."
1661.0,1666.0," That's what we should have just said, you know, sign up and we might we might."
1666.0,1667.0, You're not giving it free.
1667.0,1671.0, We could have just like sign over your 18 given the already liar.
1671.0,1672.0, We could.
1672.0,1677.0, Or we could just say give us your give us your address and we'll send you 15 free games.
1677.0,1681.0, They would have been much more cooperative.
1681.0,1682.0," Well, I'm clock."
1682.0,1685.0, The solar power don't want to clock the workout.
1685.0,1687.0, Yeah.
1687.0,1691.0, The biggest thing was being able to do it without cracking up the whole time.
1691.0,1694.0, We got like we did the first take without laughing.
1694.0,1697.0," I mean, the first people that we approached, I mean, it helped that they are young."
1697.0,1701.0," We had to work our way at two adults, but it was easy enough to do because, I mean,"
1701.0,1706.0," I don't know, before we went and did it, I was thinking if it's like going to get a shot or something when you're a kid."
1706.0,1707.0, You didn't want to do it.
1707.0,1710.0," And once we did that one, I was like, oh, we need to go get a lollipop or something."
1710.0,1712.0, We totally did it.
1712.0,1714.0," Yeah, I feel pretty proud."
1714.0,1718.0," I thought I would be the problem because Sean, I don't know, you do like crank calls and stuff."
1718.0,1723.0," But I've never been the kind of person to be able to hold a straight face while all of us like, you know, doing it."
1723.0,1727.0, No one reacted poorly to you guys holding a mic in their face.
1727.0,1728.0," No, that was the weird thing."
1728.0,1737.0," It was one of those, I think Sean mentioned this that, you know, like we had a clipboard with these like market sheet, you know, marketing surveys sheets that that we made."
1737.0,1743.0, And then I had the microphone and I think actually the microphone gave us some sort of authority like the clipboard.
1743.0,1748.0," Like the lab code system and the no-gramm authority experiment, you know, it's like, you just no one asks us."
1748.0,1755.0," We actually have like we had, you know, of course we have just this huge number of different excuses and alibi for everything."
1755.0,1758.0," And like why, um, I mean, why do you have a microphone?"
1758.0,1763.0," And it was going to be that, you know, our client, we like to put together these things called sizzle clips."
1763.0,1768.0, And so our client can actually hear your level of excitement with their own ears or your level of energy.
1768.0,1769.0," That's totally, totally, absolutely."
1769.0,1774.0," So you get the sizzle on the street, you know what's the sizzle on the street with my product?"
1774.0,1776.0, This sizzle clip.
1776.0,1779.0, We should put together a sizzle clip.
1779.0,1781.0, People just get hyped about it.
1781.0,1784.0, Like that one got us hyped for tender on dough.
1785.0,1794.0," The other thing was I expected more people to be like the couple, the older couple and just trash in it all, you know, not to even faint interest in it."
1794.0,1797.0, And so maybe we'll do it in another take.
1797.0,1799.0," We're going to, you know, we're taking some more tomorrow."
1799.0,1800.0, Yeah.
1800.0,1808.0," Where we, we set it up and tell people that normally we represent big corporations like electronic arts and activation, you know, you be soft."
1808.0,1813.0," And this time we got these, it's the startup from these brothers and they made this company called Entertech."
1813.0,1819.0," They just lost a fortune in real estate, but they had enough leftover to invest in one last thing."
1819.0,1823.0, And they decided that it was going to be games all the way games games games games.
1823.0,1831.0," And then once they're all set up, because once they made this important and real estate, you know, they were moving it over to the next hot thing, you know."
1831.0,1834.0, They just know where the money is at.
1834.0,1838.0," Yeah, it was Anthony Anthony of course helped."
1838.0,1840.0, We had to like this.
1840.0,1847.0," It's about called a brainstorming session, but considering what came out of it, I don't think it was really brainstorming sessions."
1847.0,1849.0, So I wasn't there when I was in there when I was in that movie.
1849.0,1852.0," Well, no, you were, yeah, we know we were in the other game."
1852.0,1853.0," But I mean, yeah, you're in."
1853.0,1861.0," Basically, we just came up with ideas by rehearsing it to each other and trying not to laugh and bouncing ideas off each other like we were actually being serious."
1861.0,1865.0," Yeah, any games that you guys talked about before I got there that didn't make the."
1865.0,1867.0," No, I think we developed them all."
1867.0,1873.0," Yeah. I do want to throw in, I mean, if we for the session that this is going to be confusing chronologically now,"
1873.0,1877.0," I'm talking about tomorrow, because it'll when you hear this, it'll be in there if we do it."
1877.0,1886.0," But the whole thing with that wall cart, the idea of this game that's like cart racing, but you're like on an unnobious person on a personal mover like the hover around or something."
1886.0,1894.0," And the course goes through the aisles of a Walmart, but instead of like a normal course, then everyone takes the same route, you know, you have five items, you got a pick."
1894.0,1903.0," And then you, you plot your own route through there, but then there's like this like really strategic moment, it's kind of like a pit stop where you need to get something on the top shelf and to do it."
1903.0,1910.0," You got like it's a DS game, so you got to just like spasticly move your stylist back and forth over the screen in order like reach out and grab this thing."
1910.0,1915.0," And then if you're not quick, you should see like the hardest thing for this person to do."
1915.0,1917.0, Life is a.
1917.0,1918.0, It's a tough.
1918.0,1920.0, It's a tough shelf of a Walmart.
1920.0,1921.0, So product.
1922.0,1926.0, It's snake has to if you have to match a button to get snake to crawl through a microwave oven.
1926.0,1932.0, You got to like spaz on your stylist to get this person grab grab some pigs feet off the top shelf.
1932.0,1935.0, I think it takes feet on the top shelf.
1935.0,1936.0," Yeah, they do."
1936.0,1939.0, Are you still working to go to your store in really for years?
1939.0,1942.0," Yeah, because the whole thing the whole thing and you work there is like finding the grossest stuff."
1942.0,1948.0," And then when you're closing, daring one another or all of us, we put money in a pool, say we're each going to put in five bucks."
1948.0,1954.0, And we gather three items each night whoever can consume like a specified amount of each will get the whole pot.
1954.0,1958.0, And it always be like the juice from a bottle of pigs feet like you'd have to drink and dry.
1958.0,1965.0," And then like a can of juice from concentrate, you like, well, just peer, peer concentrate."
1965.0,1971.0, And then also there's what is up called the bud and it's bud is.
1971.0,1975.0, It's a Latino product that's made from that's like head cheese.
1975.0,1979.0, It's like chopped up bits of cow meat they had.
1979.0,1982.0, And it comes in a spam like brick.
1982.0,1987.0, My friend told me the grossest part of our work in a grocery store was like being set on like the fine spoiled goods detail.
1987.0,1993.0, See just at the walk around the store and find like the person that shoved butter behind like the box of cereal a long time ago.
1993.0,1996.0," Yeah, there's always like random crap like that."
1996.0,1997.0, There's like people poke fingers.
1997.0,2001.0," I mean like in the packages of tripe and stuff, remember that we're like the same thing."
2001.0,2002.0, They'll put fish on the side.
2002.0,2004.0, They don't want fish when they're on the chip aisle.
2004.0,2007.0, And they'll stick you back behind some Doritos or something.
2007.0,2011.0, And then the other thing is that people are thieves.
2011.0,2017.0," You find out thieves aren't just like the little hood rats that you expect that they're like people of, you know,"
2017.0,2022.0," blah blah ages and just one of them would be women wanting,"
2022.0,2025.0," uh, vaginal yeast infection, wait, men's."
2025.0,2028.0," And you didn't want to pay, you know, they're expensive."
2028.0,2029.0, They're like 30 or 40 bucks.
2029.0,2030.0, And probably in there.
2030.0,2031.0, And it's fair.
2031.0,2034.0," This guaranteed you always find like on the magazine, you know,"
2034.0,2038.0, back behind the magazine is like empty boxes of whatever oint.
2038.0,2039.0, Oh yeah.
2039.0,2043.0, That's fucking disgusting.
2043.0,2046.0, What did you ever did you?
2046.0,2047.0, What?
2047.0,2049.0, Sounds give me the eye.
2049.0,2050.0, What up?
2050.0,2054.0," Dude, the thing with these microphones is that they're so intimate."
2054.0,2056.0, Like I'm listening on headphones right now.
2056.0,2057.0, We've got this really unusual.
2057.0,2058.0, So I'm so proud of it.
2058.0,2062.0, And my bedroom and the director is like talking into mics instead of our normal headsets.
2062.0,2068.0," Yeah, and so it's a little awkward, but the funny thing is everyone sounds like in B.R. like you're in it."
2068.0,2069.0, Hello.
2069.0,2075.0," Well, I'm like I'm in the way I'm leaning forward to I really do feel like I should be in the studio singing in my, my, my red hair."
2075.0,2078.0, Sing tenderondo tenderondo.
2078.0,2083.0, Why don't you come to your senses?
2084.0,2087.0, Come down from your fences.
2087.0,2090.0, Look me in the eye.
2090.0,2092.0, Stand around.
2092.0,2093.0, Oh.
2093.0,2097.0, I have nothing to say that.
2097.0,2099.0," So if I appreciate it, appreciate it."
2099.0,2102.0, I feel like you guys are serenading me with that.
2102.0,2105.0, So what are the other random stuff do we get to talk about?
2105.0,2108.0," Well, we were playing the, you played two."
2108.0,2111.0," You played a, I played a bit of political machine."
2111.0,2112.0, Political machine.
2112.0,2113.0," Oh, eight."
2113.0,2114.0, The review just went up.
2114.0,2116.0, It'll be up by the time you guys all hear this.
2116.0,2117.0, She's up.
2117.0,2118.0, Yeah.
2118.0,2120.0," Rory, my new on didn't an excellent job."
2120.0,2121.0, Yeah.
2121.0,2122.0, Okay.
2122.0,2124.0, I think sitting on out for some reason sitting in your bedroom.
2124.0,2127.0, It's going to be a possible amount to digress and digress and digress and digress.
2127.0,2128.0, But we're playing political machine.
2128.0,2131.0, I don't play one match Anthony.
2131.0,2132.0, One.
2132.0,2133.0, I played two.
2133.0,2140.0," I played a, I played one on the beginner difficulty with Obama versus McHane."
2140.0,2143.0, And then I played McHane versus Obama.
2143.0,2145.0, I played as McHane on normal.
2145.0,2148.0, And I won as Obama and I lost as McHane.
2148.0,2150.0, I lost pretty bad as McHane actually.
2150.0,2153.0, My first game I played is Ron Paul.
2153.0,2155.0, The honor will go in a call just Ron Paul.
2155.0,2161.0, And I lost by a landslide and 84 stout landslide to Barack.
2161.0,2162.0," Oh, oh."
2162.0,2163.0," Oh, bam."
2163.0,2167.0, So I think it's pretty realistic in that.
2168.0,2171.0, I just went everywhere and talked about improving the economy.
2171.0,2175.0, That's all I ever gave speeches about improving the economy and how give me money.
2175.0,2177.0, Who did you play as Barack Obama?
2177.0,2180.0," Yeah, I did Barack Obama versus he list his ass grant."
2180.0,2182.0," Oh, that's a little."
2182.0,2183.0, That's a little stacked.
2183.0,2187.0," Yeah, but basically if you haven't seen anything about the game."
2187.0,2189.0, It's a strategy game.
2189.0,2195.0," You know, it's all about capturing the most electoral college votes in all 50 states."
2195.0,2200.0, And they're all these sort of metrics that you follow as you go.
2200.0,2212.0," You know, you're building campaign headquarters and raising money so that you can place ads and and which you can place, you know, like newspaper radio and television ads."
2212.0,2221.0, And you sort of build other headquarters that give you the ability to get endorsements and or the ability to hire like political consultants.
2221.0,2222.0," Yeah, yeah, yeah, what's your kind of."
2222.0,2226.0, It seems extraordinarily complicated when you start it because there's so many different options.
2226.0,2233.0, There's so many types of endorsements to when there's so many types of special interest that you can hire like fixtures and timidators.
2233.0,2238.0," So for example, if someone has a fear of opponents got a celebrity endorsement in California, you can hire a fixer."
2238.0,2242.0, Take it and they'll kick that it'll basically off them.
2242.0,2246.0," Do something you know, smear campaigns. You can pick up cooks with just funny."
2246.0,2249.0, It's the idea of just like the supporter that you don't want.
2249.0,2253.0," I'm just pretty much like, sorry, all of run possible."
2253.0,2258.0, I take that back.
2258.0,2260.0, I'm just meeting the video game.
2260.0,2261.0," Guys, I just mean the video game."
2261.0,2269.0," There are like a moments on the map where these like question marks pop up and you can just fly there and you can get a free operative, which is kind of like a special power."
2269.0,2270.0, These are the people we're talking about.
2270.0,2277.0," And sometimes if you're not careful, you can pick up some jackass who like lowers your issue ratings and stay right."
2277.0,2283.0," And that bonus thing, what happens is the question mark on a state and it's another inducement to like travel the country."
2283.0,2290.0," They're just constantly going back and forth instead of just going between California, Florida, you know, higher and like other important states."
2290.0,2293.0, But it seems super complicated there.
2293.0,2300.0," You know, you have equivalent of, you know, meters like you would in a strategy game or something, but in this case it's like PR cloud."
2300.0,2303.0," And you spend that, you know, of course your money."
2303.0,2308.0," You're spending that every time you're buying advertising, it's a good buy advertising for print or television television."
2308.0,2316.0," Of course, in this case is the best because you're able to hit surrounding states with the with the ad placed in a single state with that."
2316.0,2321.0, But but while it's kind of intimidating me because there's so many things to learn the first game.
2321.0,2324.0," I stupidly didn't try the tutorial. I was like, I'm just going to like go raw dog in this."
2324.0,2326.0," Yeah, the company president."
2326.0,2337.0," But a Rory insists that as you continue to play it, you rapidly figured out and there's not a he's complaining that there's not enough flexibility, you know, so this this is always awkward to like, you know, speak for someone else."
2337.0,2343.0," In this case, he should have a mic. He actually should have been in a long story, but he should have been a brilliant member a long time ago."
2343.0,2347.0, But it did it ultimately becomes about the parties.
2347.0,2355.0," It's like your basic no matter what, if there's no difference in playing Ron Paul really at the end of the day, then playing as McCain or, you know, Obama."
2355.0,2364.0, And Clinton. I think part of that is because it's based on real polling data and they don't really have polling data for how John Kerry would do in the 2008.
2364.0,2365.0, Exactly.
2365.0,2370.0, And so they don't they don't really have like real polling data for how Ron Paul would do in a national race and right.
2370.0,2374.0, And so it's really like I think they have pollinated mainly for the parties.
2374.0,2375.0, Yeah.
2375.0,2383.0, And also suggest that it's easy to sort of game a system with these all powerful like they're certain topics like if you're going to give a speech.
2383.0,2392.0," Rather than just mess around and give one that is like going to, you know, satisfy people that are registered, you know, Democrats or Republicans."
2392.0,2398.0, You just hit these like all purpose topics like I'm like I'm a poet. I oppose high gas prices or something.
2398.0,2399.0," Yeah, we're like I support economy."
2399.0,2404.0," Yeah, I improve the economy and it's like you just go from state to state saying, you know,"
2404.0,2407.0, I don't like high gas prices. I don't like high gas prices. I don't like high gas prices.
2407.0,2410.0," Because if you do it the right way, you could win every time that way."
2410.0,2416.0," And that's interesting because it's like ultimately, however you play and whatever the successful strategy is turned out to be, I think they're going to like,"
2416.0,2419.0, Those are going to be the game's commentary deliberate or not.
2419.0,2423.0," Yeah, the game is going to then comment on the election process, you know, though."
2423.0,2433.0," Well, already like I found that, I mean, like you were saying each state, you know, you can take out ads or give speeches or whatever and you're giving these list of things that you either."
2433.0,2442.0," Or I oppose the war on terror withdrawing from the war in Iraq, improving the economy, you know, high gas prices."
2442.0,2448.0, You you comment on these things and speeches or or in ads or on television appearances.
2448.0,2453.0," You do these like, you know, TV things where they ask you questions and you answer."
2453.0,2459.0," But the thing is like you go to each state and you look at the data and it just shows you just go with like,"
2459.0,2462.0," whichever has the highest number for your candidate, you know, it gives you."
2462.0,2465.0, It's real obvious like what you should be talking about in each state.
2465.0,2474.0," And I think the commentary is, you know, in the fact that you're in playing this game, you're not actually playing like as a candidate that you would like to see run,"
2474.0,2482.0," who is really believing what they're saying, you're playing as a candidate has to run in this country or the way the candidates do run in this country,"
2482.0,2485.0, which is just to use polling data to try to say what people want to hear.
2485.0,2487.0," Yes, cynicism and opportunism."
2487.0,2492.0," Yes, throughout the whole game and that's what I was getting at, but like the message, whatever the game's implicit message is just that."
2492.0,2493.0, Yeah.
2493.0,2503.0," Yeah. And like the other weird thing, those, and I guess this must have something to do with the fact that they used polling data to create these state, you know, values."
2503.0,2507.0," But man, it's really the deck is really stacked against McCain."
2507.0,2514.0," I feel like everywhere, if you when you play against McCain, at least in, you know, in the one match that I played with McCain,"
2514.0,2524.0," that having played as Obama, like, if you play McCain against Obama, like, his issues that are positive with voters aren't nearly as positive."
2524.0,2532.0," So like, you know, Ohio, Obama, you know, gets, you know, 90 points on McCain for saying that he would like to withdraw from Iraq,"
2532.0,2537.0, whereas McCain only gets like 40 points for saying he wants tax cuts.
2537.0,2542.0," Right. You know, which might reflect reality, but as a strategy game, I feel like it's much harder for McCain to win,"
2542.0,2549.0," which only really makes me happy if that's like reflecting reality. But it is, it is a more challenging game if you try to play."
2549.0,2561.0," I think with candidates that have tougher issues, but the other interesting thing about it that I thought, and I don't know if you, if you experience this, but like, I did think it was kind of complicated at first,"
2561.0,2571.0," but in playing with Obama, like, to begin with, like, I literally just said, I'm going to try to do like the real strategy and just milk to the funds out of New York and California, like,"
2571.0,2576.0," fund fundraising in New York and California for New York building the biggest headquarters there, as soon as I could say,"
2576.0,2584.0," right, as much money as I could, and then flying to Ohio and Florida, and, you know, the swing states and just desperately, you know,"
2584.0,2591.0, taking out television ads and putting all my operatives in there and making sure that I was winning the states and running base significant choice as well.
2591.0,2596.0," I couldn't figure out the, like, how, how the running mate, you could a huge bonus based on, so say,"
2596.0,2604.0," in my case, I ran this run Paul with George W. Bush's, my, for vice president, and that guaranteed me Texas."
2604.0,2608.0," Yeah, he was able to, like, sit in Texas and just, I mean, that was it."
2608.0,2611.0," It was the end of the story, you know, for at least for that state."
2611.0,2617.0," So, yeah, I guess, depending, you know, whatever, I didn't really, I don't know the exact extent of the variables that they've been doing."
2617.0,2623.0," I mean, I mean, I mean, I can also fund raising, added cloud, but I mean, presence on certain issues or what."
2623.0,2628.0," Yeah, I mean, you can also definitely use them to, like, they boost your awareness."
2628.0,2637.0," Like awareness is sort of the baseline of, of the game, like, you're, you're going around basically letting people know who you are at first before you can even get them to vote for you."
2637.0,2638.0, Right.
2638.0,2651.0," And, and so you can, whenever you go to a state, it boosts your awareness, but when you have a VP, you can send them into states that we learn the power of awareness when some of the people in that first section said that they liked that they were willing to pay."
2652.0,2659.0," The full retail price for duty calls and on the scale, you know, one to 20, how enthusiastically you were willing, like, an 18."
2659.0,2663.0," I mean, that we pretty much just had to say this game exists."
2663.0,2665.0," No, yeah, that's all it took."
2665.0,2668.0, I will pay $70 for it for duty calls.
2668.0,2676.0," As long as, as long as the main character has a helmet with a mysterious visor, I thought it was Harris Tall's Gile, but wait, not quite as Tall's Gile."
2676.0,2677.0, But a flat top.
2677.0,2682.0," It was like, you should just ask for like a character creation."
2682.0,2693.0," That is, that should be something duty calls has the first ever game with character creation and the first person shooter even though you're never get to see his face."
2693.0,2695.0, Has everything ever been done?
2695.0,2696.0, I think that's probably been done.
2696.0,2697.0, That's just point.
2697.0,2701.0, The whole point of duty calls was the offer people multi-relearned money.
2701.0,2709.0," You know, the only thing that I've noticed is that it existed since the f***ing ad baby of, you know, online video games."
2709.0,2710.0, Yeah.
2710.0,2713.0, So back to the political machine.
2713.0,2719.0," Yeah, just one thing we have mentioned is that it's made by start out, same people made sense of a solar empire."
2719.0,2722.0," Which they have like one of the characters in there, right? What's his name?"
2722.0,2724.0," So they have a, they have a, they have a, they have a alien."
2724.0,2725.0," Yeah, I saw that."
2725.0,2731.0," My, my concern with the game is I didn't really have that much fun on the first pass and that might not mean anything."
2731.0,2735.0," It could be, you know, like, you continue to play it and then you really start to appreciate it."
2735.0,2739.0," But in my case, I mean, this is a challenge for all strategy games."
2739.0,2741.0, It's like getting over that hump.
2741.0,2742.0, Yeah.
2742.0,2745.0," You know, but I just was like, I didn't enjoy that much."
2745.0,2747.0, I like I appreciate it more for existing.
2747.0,2748.0, Got it.
2748.0,2753.0," It's like, I like to see, I mean, just that we, we talked about, you know, seeing daring and different types of games."
2753.0,2755.0," And not just, you know, another, this or that."
2755.0,2760.0, And then here we have one that's absolutely unique and yet I wasn't immediately turned on to it.
2760.0,2761.0," You know, which is normal."
2761.0,2762.0," Me, not everything's going to work."
2762.0,2764.0," But yeah, I thought it was pretty fun."
2764.0,2776.0," I mean, I don't, I couldn't see playing it for like months and months, but I, I imagine I'll probably play it for like, you know, six or seven more times just to see, like, you know, if I can beat the higher, the higher levels and stuff."
2776.0,2779.0," I mean, it's, it's, there's some wild cards in it."
2779.0,2784.0," And that I don't think I've seen all of the, all the operatives who are, you know, this people with special powers."
2784.0,2788.0," Because I, last time I played, I got this guy who's like, Bonneau, like a rock star."
2788.0,2791.0," Right. There's a lot of, I mean, because there's like Barry King."
2791.0,2792.0, Yeah.
2792.0,2793.0," We're, we're obviously, you know."
2793.0,2794.0, Yeah.
2794.0,2795.0, But there are these stuff.
2795.0,2796.0, Right.
2796.0,2797.0, Yeah.
2797.0,2798.0," And those are, those are weird though."
2798.0,2804.0," Like, I had trouble when I was playing with McCain because for some reason, I immediately gravitated towards trying to grab the independent voters."
2804.0,2807.0, So I would be answering kind of moderate on the questions.
2807.0,2811.0, But I think they expected the answers to be like straight conservative.
2811.0,2813.0, So I'd get like booze from the crowd.
2813.0,2817.0," Like, I don't know if you should, you should run as Robert Ashley next time you play."
2817.0,2819.0, Maybe you can create your own character.
2819.0,2820.0, So I create my own party.
2820.0,2821.0, That's a good question.
2821.0,2822.0," No, party, bro."
2822.0,2823.0, Yeah.
2823.0,2824.0," Vote, bro."
2824.0,2825.0, It would be independent.
2825.0,2826.0, You could be a Republican.
2826.0,2827.0, You could be a Democrat.
2827.0,2828.0, Cool.
2828.0,2829.0, All there is.
2830.0,2838.0, This one up podcast is brought to you by Hill to the chip from GameCock Media.
2838.0,2844.0," Hill to the chip is a fast party game, but I'm writing to become the next thing that the animal can say."
2844.0,2849.0," Packs of barnochal crawling, lush interactive environments, and a talking wood chunk."
2849.0,2851.0, It's the best selection you'll see this year.
2851.0,2853.0, Available to 24.0.
2854.0,2856.0, I'm just thinking about this idea.
2856.0,2865.0," Recently, we've had all these games come out that really celebrate choice and the players ability, you know, freedom to play it distinctly, you know, in a unique way."
2865.0,2872.0," An example we've met with your song for obviously, you can play stealthily, you can, you know, go open combat with it."
2872.0,2877.0," All the way back to oblivion by those shocks, another clear example for people that want to hack machines."
2877.0,2881.0," People that want to use one set of powers, people that just want to use their guns primarily."
2881.0,2883.0," I came out recently, another game like that."
2883.0,2891.0, I just noticed that like among some of the most vocal proponents of these kind of games.
2891.0,2900.0," It's like if they see if they sense that someone's criticizing the game, then they immediately turn and suggest that they were playing it wrong."
2900.0,2908.0," And so all of a sudden this, this freedom that was a cause for, you know, celebration and for the game, then become the conjure that they beat you with."
2908.0,2911.0," Oh, you must have played this game as a shooter."
2911.0,2917.0," That's why, or you, you must have just used this or overused this."
2917.0,2918.0, Or you played it on easy.
2918.0,2919.0, Or you played it on easy.
2919.0,2920.0," Yeah, and that's the next layer."
2920.0,2924.0," And it goes, yeah, I mean, it's like how it applies to exactly."
2924.0,2929.0," I mean, go, hey, let's the one I most associate it with because of the, you know, the legendary heroic modes everyone talks about."
2929.0,2930.0, What a difficult that you played on.
2930.0,2931.0," And it's like, learn it up."
2931.0,2937.0," Like you're, you know, instantly, you're relevant, whatever you have to say, if you didn't, you know, master it on the hardest mode."
2937.0,2940.0, It happened again with Call 84 and that came up.
2940.0,2943.0, And so you see that version.
2943.0,2949.0," And then on Steven to tell us MTV multiplayer, bought recently, he posted just some initial impressions of it."
2949.0,2952.0," And I'm just for, and in a course of it, they're really positive too."
2952.0,2957.0," In the course of it, he said that he was playing on a standard definition television."
2957.0,2963.0," And immediately a lot of people came on there just come crazy, you know, saying, all credibility lost."
2963.0,2976.0," You know, you're a total idiot. What a tool. And this one guy's just like bragging about all kinds of nonsense, you know, about his aspect ratios and his monster gold cables and stuff and say, like this is why, you know, you'll never be able to talk about this game."
2976.0,2982.0," You can't talk about this game if you play it like 80% of people, you know, who buy metal gear solid for it kind of play it."
2982.0,2984.0, Right. Like everyone has an HD TV.
2984.0,2985.0, Exactly.
2985.0,2989.0," So yeah, just thinking about putting together different thoughts on this whole phenomenon."
2989.0,2996.0, And clearly we're talking about the most. It's not everyone. We're talking about a subset of just a diehard fans of certain games and franchises.
2996.0,3005.0, But but that notion of trying to delegitimize another person's experiences interesting to me because games are so fundamentally about your own experience on it.
3005.0,3012.0," You know, you gave me your example of when you're playing metal gear solid for the crying wolf."
3012.0,3013.0, Yeah.
3013.0,3017.0," And it sounded like it was a total, you know, wash for you. It was almost like a bug or something."
3017.0,3018.0, Yeah.
3018.0,3024.0," And how, you know, I joke to you when you told me that that this is first thing people are going to be like, you played it wrong."
3024.0,3028.0," If you, if you were to, if you would put that out there as though it were some because they're just seeing your put it out there."
3028.0,3030.0, So we're not to buy the game.
3030.0,3033.0, Yeah. I wouldn't say that it was particularly not enjoyable in me.
3033.0,3037.0," Actually, like in that game, like getting through a boss bottle really quick, I felt kind of like relieved."
3037.0,3038.0, Really.
3038.0,3046.0," But basically, and playing and fighting crying wolf, you know, the whole thing is that you're supposed to"
3046.0,3055.0," catch her when she's out of, when she's out of her, like, little suit, you know, what is she's like a wolf robot."
3055.0,3058.0, She opens up the hood and takes out her sniper rifle and she's looking for you.
3058.0,3062.0," Well, the level is really huge that you're fighting her and there's guys all in it."
3062.0,3063.0, There's two buildings.
3063.0,3068.0," And I thought that I was supposed to just, I didn't think that it was like my time to fight her yet."
3068.0,3073.0," Like I was running and looking for the exit to where I would get, you know, to where I was going to be fighting her for real."
3073.0,3078.0," And so I found this back area towards the, you know, the back end of the level."
3078.0,3083.0," And then that was closed. So I started making my way around this little like canyon, rocky canyon."
3083.0,3086.0," There's no one over there, you know, no soldiers or anything running after me."
3086.0,3092.0, And I put on my night scope and see crying wolf or whatever in the trees.
3092.0,3098.0," And I zoom in on it and I could tell that she's got the hood up and just popper, like six times without her closing the thing,"
3098.0,3105.0," and killed her in the first try. I mean, I think that they weren't expecting like serious snipeage."
3105.0,3107.0," But yeah, so there's two context for this."
3107.0,3112.0," One is that if people like will listen to you, listen or if they were to read it, if you were to, you know, come on a message board."
3112.0,3117.0, The assumption is that the commentary should be read in the sense of a review.
3117.0,3123.0," Like, oh, this is me saying, this is how things are and maybe that's their reaction or it's just the casual conversations."
3123.0,3128.0," Like, we told me it was like, you know, it's no skin off my back. I had a much, much better time in that battle."
3128.0,3134.0," But the interesting thing for me is how different it is. And it's like that you can't, in my mind, you really can't deal with generalized version because that's it."
3134.0,3138.0," You, that's your experience of it. That's exactly how it happened. And you can go and do it again."
3138.0,3145.0," But I mean, that first experience is just, that's just how it happened. And now if you take in multiply this granted that I suspect in this case, it's a bug."
3145.0,3149.0," But even aside from bugs when there's just differences when people try different things,"
3149.0,3155.0," another example I have is the guy, Pegorino in GTA 4 in your, your basically supposed to assassinate him."
3155.0,3158.0, But I wouldn't be supposed to go and chase him and he's waiting in a boat on a dock.
3158.0,3162.0," But if you're clever and you're, you're looking at your map, you see where he's at."
3162.0,3168.0," You're like, oh, he's right there. And then you pull out your sniper rifle and you can see his head bobbing up and you try to shoot him and just the blood will splatter."
3168.0,3172.0," But nothing happens. And then you're like, well, let me hit him with a rocket blow this fucking boat bits."
3172.0,3178.0," And then of course, that doesn't do anything either because the game is really wanting you to go up there and trigger the extended scene involving helicopter."
3178.0,3183.0," And all sorts of other stuff. And it's like, not to criticize the game for that."
3183.0,3192.0, But if that person who chose that path is going to have a radically different experience than someone who just very naturally was inclined to run right up to that boat.
3192.0,3196.0, And very seamlessly move into that scene into the sequence that the developers intended.
3196.0,3203.0," But I think when you like multiply these kind of things on the scale across an entire experience of playing a game from beginning and it's just like more,"
3203.0,3212.0," I mean, it's just reinforces like how subjective it's really going to be. I mean, everyone is going to, and I think that's reason to celebrate games. I mean, that's what makes him interesting to me."
3212.0,3214.0, But I think we'll find it frustrating.
3214.0,3229.0," Yeah, especially because there's this weird reaction that everyone should really line up all the sort of enthusiasm, all the fans should really line up and, you know, seeing the same praises of the game even though everyone sort of playing it differently."
3229.0,3235.0," And maybe you're having a good time, but you're probably playing it different than the, you know, the next got right."
3235.0,3249.0," Yeah, unless it's something just ridiculously linear. I mean, games just tend not to be that way anymore. You know, it's not like you're playing a, like a side scrolling shooter or something where you're dodging the same bullets. You're having the exact same game experience."
3249.0,3253.0," Yeah, I've had that growing up like when we used to play a middle-gear sold to and stuff like that."
3253.0,3261.0," And I would get caught instead of like reloading from the last save. I just like kill all the guys in the hide. My friends, my friends would be like, that's not how you're supposed to play."
3261.0,3267.0," They would rather roll. They would rather just kill, get killed or reloads that at the end they would only have been like discovered like once."
3267.0,3275.0," Like being discovered was like, they're playing the game. Like even that was a failure for them. Whereas me, I was like, if I get discovered and I get out of it, that was like, good enough."
3275.0,3280.0," Yeah, it's, I don't know. I think it's interesting to hear about different ways that people play."
3280.0,3290.0," And I think a lot of times too, I mean, you will even inform and stuff among, you know, the die hard. You will see some of that people are kind of like trading stories and stuff and it's all fun and games until someone"
3290.0,3299.0," Seem slightly negative. And then you bring out the knives and you say, you did it wrong. I think it's really, I mean, part of it's just it's just an easy way"
3299.0,3309.0," Retortical way to win an argument, right? I mean, you're wrong. I'm right. I mean, that's the end of it. You're not inviting anymore discussion. That's it. You know,"
3309.0,3316.0," Although it's really, it's one of the things that only works like in the context of a message board. You could never like make that argument in person."
3316.0,3325.0," Because once you say, you've played it wrong. Like, you know, your argument is going to be like defeated and just, you know, 10 seconds of rational conversation."
3325.0,3335.0," Sports are interesting for me for that way. I mean, just like the sociological point of view, the way that people argue is like, you can you can you can throw something out there and just scape with escape into anonymity or or also just the fact that there's"
3335.0,3344.0," Even if even if you're known in the community, which was the pure volume of different responses and stuff and it's like someone really going to look at mine closely and think it over."
3344.0,3358.0," They're just going to bounce to the next one and get this general sense that I'm just satisfied with them or I don't like what they did, but then when you really look at it and you're like, there's not like a shred of like rationality to this at all, you know, and then"
3358.0,3373.0," Not the time to just don't think that you can really no one reads anything that's over like, you know, 50 words anyway. So you get you get like a sniping moment unless unless you're you're looking enough for people to actually like recognize you because you post there a lot."
3373.0,3384.0," Like I know a lot to people and you know in the message board is that I'll sit and read, but if it's just some some dude that I've never read before, I'm not going to stop and read some crazy long diary and write."
3384.0,3394.0," So like, there's like a thousand words. Someone's like hit the response or like, you know, a meme or a visual, visual responses are our choice."
3394.0,3405.0," Even like, you know, shump fits up like a really long blog that has like thought out things and you just see people that are like, I don't know these words that you use. You can tell they read like the first paragraph and are like, you're just stupid. Like, I mean,"
3405.0,3412.0," He doesn't even doesn't even matter. I think if there's a name recognition sometimes as soon as they see something that we're in the post that they don't like,"
3412.0,3418.0," you know, you're just going to move on and the danger on our side of getting and then they hold in it, you know, hold it, you got a bold for effect."
3418.0,3427.0," When you when you catch someone, it's like, here's the synopsis that the yeah, I always think about doing that. I'm like, I anticipate exactly where it is going to be misunderstanding. So it's maybe it's my fault."
3427.0,3433.0," Is it to be a caterer, but I'm like, do I really want to put like the bullet point thing at the end of this? Yes, I really do like this game."
3433.0,3441.0," The reason I'm talking about this is because, you know, it's like, we should be actually like a new message board program that uses power point like the actual Microsoft power."
3441.0,3457.0," You can just load up slides. We could make that while there are already is the game about I mean, you know, four more. But we can make the game instead where it's like a mix of four more and the political machine 2008 where you actually trying to keep everyone happy on the internet, which is probably like trying to, you know,"
3457.0,3461.0," That's sad, it's filed voters in the country. That would be the most complicated game ever."
3461.0,3463.0, Can you imagine how you would be very funny.
3463.0,3467.0, You would be very funny.
3467.0,3480.0," You know what we should talk about. We should talk about a little commercial that you that you showed me earlier. Oh, WETPETS WETPETS webpass."
3480.0,3485.0," Hello, one stop one shop. We got it all. Anything you can get in the column."
3485.0,3491.0," Something like Ravi Sandogs, Hastor's favorite keys. I've scored a young."
3491.0,3498.0, That's it. Yes. So we need to play a sample of that. This is for years and years. This would come on.
3498.0,3506.0," And if Melissa would be another rumor, I'd be in the room and it would come on. It would be like scream like to get the other come out because we spent all this time trying to memorize it."
3506.0,3514.0," Of course, we weren't taping it or anything. And I could never find it online. I was like, there's no way someone that lives in this region hasn't put this on YouTube yet."
3514.0,3520.0, It belongs on YouTube. And I finally found it like a couple of years after we've been watching it. And you guys just got to see it.
3520.0,3526.0, WETPETS WETPETS webpass.
3526.0,3531.0, Only one place where fish and lizards hang out with cats and chinchillas.
3531.0,3561.0, WETWETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS
3561.0,3589.5, WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS WETS Fishing has gone
3589.5,3592.94, I have no idea where it's at other than Sam Pan.
3592.94,3593.94, No.
3593.94,3599.38, So why did you guys suddenly decide?
3599.38,3602.18," I mean, what was the moment that you saw that commercial"
3602.18,3604.3, that you thought it was like a commercial that you guys
3604.3,3606.1, just really needed to memorize the song?
3606.1,3608.74, He's undeniably dope on the first viewing.
3608.74,3611.26," If that came on your TV, you just sought now"
3611.26,3612.58, and you want to talk about it.
3612.58,3615.7," If that was on the TV, you and Sarah"
3615.7,3618.58, would have made it your mission to memorize the thing.
3618.58,3620.86," I mean, really we wanted to just record it,"
3620.86,3622.46, but it haven't even been to do so.
3622.46,3623.46, No.
3623.46,3627.54, And so we recorded it in our minds.
3627.54,3630.1, That's just a little bit for everyone.
3630.1,3634.18, That's just a little bit of a thing in all the way over here.
3634.18,3639.06," So you got any commercials like that,"
3639.06,3640.2599999999998, even from your youth.
3640.2599999999998,3641.62," Yeah, tap plastics."
3641.62,3643.02, That's the only one I remember.
3643.02,3644.7799999999997," Tap plastics, what's that?"
3644.7799999999997,3647.18," Tap, tap, tap plastics."
3647.18,3649.2599999999998, The fantastic plastic place?
3649.2599999999998,3650.7," Oh, no."
3650.7,3651.54, What are you buying?
3651.54,3652.7, Tap plastic.
3652.7,3653.54, I don't know.
3653.54,3654.22, Like a stainless steel.
3654.22,3655.54, I think it's a good container store.
3655.54,3657.1, Why didn't they do something with that?
3657.1,3658.1, Would you tap?
3658.1,3660.1," Oh, yeah."
3660.1,3661.7, That would be a lot of that.
3664.8999999999996,3667.3399999999997, OK.
3667.3399999999997,3669.4199999999996, This is where we're flagging.
3669.4199999999996,3670.46, So I got something for you.
3670.46,3672.02, Before you do that.
3672.02,3672.8199999999997, OK.
3672.8199999999997,3674.66, So I want to tell you guys some more stories
3674.66,3676.06, from my childhood.
3676.06,3678.42, I think this is a good time to talk about these.
3678.42,3681.98, It's like bonus material.
3681.98,3686.5," Well, in San Diego, it would often be hot after school."
3686.5,3689.42, So we had this whole thing where we'd come home.
3689.42,3691.98," And in one of the houses we were in it,"
3691.98,3694.86, it was the backyard had a small chain link fence
3694.86,3697.42, that was connected to an elementary school.
3697.42,3699.2599999999998," And there was a boys club, boys and girls club,"
3699.2599999999998,3701.38, where kids would hang out there after school.
3701.38,3703.18," So when we'd leave junior high,"
3703.18,3704.94, and traditionally leaving junior high would involve
3704.94,3706.3," like going to the ice cream truck,"
3706.3,3708.3, there was like parked outside and getting half of us
3708.3,3709.86, on one side and half of us on the other
3709.86,3711.42, and doing the like heave ho.
3711.42,3713.34, Rock the thing like back before.
3713.34,3714.7400000000002, This is where the guy would stick his head out
3714.7400000000002,3716.26," to think of yell at us, because like the chips"
3716.26,3718.58, were falling off the pegs and stuff.
3718.58,3720.66, So why?
3720.66,3721.86, We'd walk after that.
3721.86,3723.2200000000003, We just continue to go down the street.
3723.2200000000003,3726.06," If kids were riding by and bikes,"
3726.06,3728.78," you throw your bag, your tote bag down in front of them."
3728.78,3730.9," So like they had a, hey, hate it like a speed bump"
3730.9,3734.18," or something, or conversely run"
3734.18,3736.4199999999996, if the high school kids were in the area or someone else
3736.4199999999996,3738.06," that would be like looking at, you know,"
3738.06,3740.7799999999997," tormented you, it's just the typical, you know,"
3740.7799999999997,3742.14, tormented and be tormented.
3742.14,3744.66," But then we get home and we found this perfect,"
3744.66,3747.74, like middle ground where it was fun for everyone.
3747.74,3750.8999999999996," And so we'd start with, we'd get this water balloon launcher"
3750.8999999999996,3752.8199999999997," and start shooting water balloons down into,"
3752.8199999999997,3754.62," it was called the balls, basically just like,"
3754.62,3756.1," you know, a natural amphitheater,"
3756.1,3757.7," where you would eat your launch,"
3757.7,3759.22, but kids would play soccer and stuff
3759.22,3760.4199999999996," from the boys club or whatever,"
3760.4199999999996,3761.8599999999997, they just do something there.
3761.8599999999997,3762.94," So they're out there, then all of a sudden"
3762.94,3764.54, water balloon started raining down.
3764.54,3766.94," And that was their call, like it's time to play."
3766.94,3769.26, And then so they'd come up to the back of the fence
3769.26,3771.18, and start throwing rocks and shit at us.
3771.18,3773.9, So we had hoses and we'd spray them with those
3773.9,3776.7400000000002," and then we'd fill, you know, grocery bags with water."
3776.7400000000002,3778.66," Um, we'd should get quite a bit of water."
3778.66,3780.42," I'm sure more than a gallon in a, you know,"
3780.42,3781.58, a plastic grocery sack.
3781.58,3782.78, And we'd get those in your hand.
3782.78,3783.62, Like a sling.
3783.62,3785.5," And yeah, like David Goliath, we knew it."
3785.5,3787.62," So we, they would come in our fence."
3787.62,3789.18, They would jump the fence and come and do it.
3789.18,3790.18," And like they would, they loved it"
3790.18,3792.3," because like if we weren't there, if we were inside,"
3792.3,3793.98," you know, playing games or hanging out or something,"
3793.98,3796.26," you'd hear like rocks hitting the siding of the house,"
3796.26,3798.6200000000003," you know, and others are assigned to go out there."
3798.6200000000003,3801.98," And then, um, so we'd go chase them and sometimes it was bad"
3801.98,3803.6600000000003, though like you'd hate them with one of the things.
3803.6600000000003,3806.02, And it would knock them down like it would just knock them
3806.02,3806.86, right out their feet.
3806.86,3810.38, One of the big bags that we did that forever.
3810.38,3812.82," But then, um, the water balloon launcher,"
3813.94,3815.54, we ended up having a whole lot of fun with that
3815.54,3818.1000000000004," because we were able to take it, uh,"
3819.38,3821.3," but one of my friends, like he had an apartment"
3821.3,3822.82, as a cross-estreet from a McDonald's.
3822.82,3825.1000000000004, And that is enormous and flatable Ronald McDonald's
3825.1000000000004,3826.26, on the roof for a while.
3826.26,3828.1800000000003, And the drive through was facing the street
3828.1800000000003,3830.38, and the Ronald McDonald's up above that.
3830.38,3832.86," So we were able to shoot that with water balloons,"
3832.86,3834.38," you know, trying to hit him in his boesack,"
3834.38,3837.26," like above, uh, the people that are just driving through"
3837.26,3838.86, getting their orders and stuff.
3838.86,3841.7400000000002, And then the manager comes over across the street
3841.7400000000002,3843.26," and he's like, why are you doing that?"
3843.26,3845.1000000000004," Like, because this is a giant Ronald McDonald's"
3845.1000000000004,3845.94, on the roof.
3845.94,3847.6600000000003, They didn't want to hit him in the boesack with the water balloon.
3847.6600000000003,3848.5, What do you mean?
3848.5,3849.34, Why were you doing it?
3849.34,3850.1800000000003, Yeah.
3850.18,3851.02, So it's fine.
3851.02,3852.02, I already called the police.
3852.02,3854.74, And then the water balloon thing led to more trouble
3854.74,3858.62," because outside of another friend's dad's house,"
3858.62,3860.4199999999996," you know, he had like, parents were separated."
3860.4199999999996,3863.58," He just, they, these brothers, I've talked about these brothers."
3863.58,3864.4199999999996," Yes, you have."
3864.4199999999996,3866.02," And then skin farting on the, on the,"
3866.02,3868.22, their youngest brother and how the one actually
3868.22,3870.22," pulled his pants down, farted across the dinner table"
3870.22,3872.98, after the dad had just set the table.
3872.98,3875.54," But these guys, so they're at this house."
3875.54,3878.58," And it was called the, the be all field."
3878.58,3879.66, It was just like a ball field.
3879.66,3881.62, The adults would play like softball and stuff there
3881.62,3882.5, in the evenings.
3882.5,3884.2999999999997," So then we just launched the water balloons,"
3884.2999999999997,3886.62," you know, up across the street and into their softball"
3886.62,3887.3799999999997, game the whole time.
3887.3799999999997,3889.1, You can ask what is a water balloon on the floor?
3889.1,3890.5, The three person launching.
3890.5,3893.1," You take like, yeah, it's a three person thing where"
3893.1,3896.2599999999998, it's made of constructive like surgical tubing.
3896.2599999999998,3899.22," And it has like a, basically,"
3899.22,3902.8599999999997," so three people, you know, one person each holds the end."
3902.8599999999997,3903.98, You basically act as post.
3903.98,3906.06, You can also put them on metal posts if you want.
3906.06,3908.3399999999997, And then you stretch back the surgical tubing
3908.34,3909.1800000000003, as far as you can.
3909.1800000000003,3912.02, And there's a pouch to put the water balloon in that rest in.
3912.02,3913.94, And this was just giant slingshot.
3913.94,3916.34, You put back about seven or eight feet and let it go.
3916.34,3919.1800000000003," And so you, we'd start doing that, you know,"
3919.1800000000003,3922.6600000000003, launching it onto the people playing at the be all field.
3922.6600000000003,3924.78, And then it's straight down the street.
3924.78,3926.1800000000003, They're pretty fun to do horizontally.
3926.1800000000003,3928.6200000000003," So like you time it, you have a spotter out on the sidewalk"
3928.6200000000003,3930.26, and then you'd be down like that down the lane.
3930.26,3931.54, They lived in and he would tell you
3931.54,3932.54, when the cars are coming.
3932.54,3936.5, And then you try to hit the cars like directly from the side.
3936.5,3939.26, Why are you such a hellie and when you're a kid?
3939.26,3940.9, That's the thing.
3940.9,3942.38," Because you know, there's this like makes it,"
3942.38,3943.82, some people react to it really negative.
3943.82,3946.06, It looks like I'll talk seriously about something.
3946.06,3949.54, And then I'll just ridiculous joke or the seemingly inappropriate.
3949.54,3951.5," It's like, that's just pretty much."
3951.5,3954.42, And other people have heard like think that it's affected
3954.42,3956.34, or it's fake that some part of it's fake.
3956.34,3957.82, But that's just like how it's always bent.
3957.82,3961.26," I mean, my dad was total raging alcoholic up to a certain point"
3961.26,3962.54, in my youth.
3962.54,3965.3, We'd move schools every eight months or something
3965.3,3967.1000000000004, because we were evicted from an apartment or an area.
3967.1000000000004,3969.0600000000004, And he would be cut off from the very slick
3969.0600000000004,3970.34, or stores were having too much of a tab.
3970.34,3971.34, So we'd move.
3971.34,3974.3, And like that's the kind of thing where you have a couple of options
3974.3,3976.6600000000003, to meet new friends all the time.
3976.6600000000003,3978.94, And one of them is to do fucked up shit
3978.94,3980.1400000000003, in a make-and-lap.
3980.1400000000003,3982.5800000000004, It's like the quickest way to get in with a new group of kids
3982.5800000000004,3983.54," when you're, you know."
3983.54,3984.98, So that was just very normal.
3984.98,3986.5800000000004," And it just seemed like, I mean, half the time,"
3986.5800000000004,3988.1800000000003," there's no one watching you or something,"
3988.1800000000003,3990.7400000000002, a latchkey kid or something.
3990.7400000000002,3992.94," And then the same time was like, I'd be serious in school."
3992.94,3993.82, And I wanted to learn too.
3993.82,3996.94, But you just go back and forth between the two.
3996.94,3997.78, So it seemed normal.
3997.78,3999.06, But it was fun.
3999.06,3999.9, Yeah.
3999.9,4000.42, Yeah.
4000.42,4001.42, It's just what you would do.
4001.42,4001.78, Yeah.
4001.78,4002.6200000000003, Yeah.
4002.6200000000003,4004.42," No, I mean, everyone knows a kid like that."
4004.42,4006.6600000000003," You know, be visits or butt head."
4006.6600000000003,4007.6600000000003, Yeah.
4007.6600000000003,4008.6600000000003, Yeah.
4008.6600000000003,4010.38, Yeah.
4010.38,4011.34, But eventually stopped.
4011.34,4012.1800000000003, It was kind of funny.
4012.1800000000003,4014.42," Like, so I was like one referral away from going"
4014.42,4016.86, to their former school called Shaperall in the area.
4016.86,4019.5," And that's like where gang members, drug addicts,"
4019.5,4020.46, like serious cases.
4020.46,4022.94, Like not people who just do stupid ass shit.
4022.94,4026.98," Like decide someone, you know, decide that you want to make a campaign"
4026.98,4029.18, for the student body elections for someone who doesn't actually
4029.18,4031.06, running and put up posters everywhere.
4031.06,4033.26," Like, you know, vote vote for like the guy's nickname was"
4033.26,4037.78," Croville for Cro, he talks no slaw and like all of this random"
4037.78,4038.62, man.
4038.62,4040.1, He talks and slaw.
4040.1,4042.94," So for a bunch of stupid stuff like that, you know."
4042.94,4047.02," And at some point, he just like, you know, you'll go far"
4047.02,4051.34," if you cut the shit out, you know, why do you, you know,"
4051.34,4052.34, they would always do the same thing.
4052.34,4053.7000000000003, Why do you do this?
4053.7000000000003,4058.1400000000003, Because I had one time where it was like dark club in junior high.
4058.1400000000003,4058.34, Yeah.
4058.34,4060.1000000000004, And the principal was a British guy.
4060.1000000000004,4064.2200000000003," And he, uh, in his own time, he didn't have to stay after school."
4064.2200000000003,4066.06, He just sounded like it gets some kids in the dark.
4066.06,4067.6600000000003, It's like I really like dark.
4067.6600000000003,4070.06, And we don't get in there and there's this tradition.
4070.06,4072.98," And he'd be like, let's play some darts."
4072.98,4074.58," And he's a, and he's a, and he's a, and he's a"
4074.58,4077.02," South very British, but they would come out like darts."
4077.02,4080.38," And he, you know, he got us like, I'm sure it"
4080.38,4081.38, lost to himself.
4081.38,4084.86, He would buy like nice darts sets and sell them to us for cheaper.
4084.86,4085.86, So we can afford them.
4085.86,4088.06, And he'd always buy this enormous bag of popcorn.
4088.06,4090.94, It was like a hefty trash bag full of popcorn.
4090.94,4092.7000000000003, And I'd be having fun playing darts.
4092.7000000000003,4095.62, And then all of a sudden I pick up the bag of popcorn and just like open the top
4095.62,4100.26," and just throw the whole thing up in the, and I don't know why I did it."
4100.26,4103.3," And he asked me he's like, like, why, why would you do this?"
4103.3,4104.3, Yeah.
4104.3,4105.8," Part of it is just being, I don't know."
4105.8,4107.62, There's something about being a young male.
4107.62,4109.62, Like that was junior high to be fair.
4109.62,4110.62, Yeah.
4110.62,4111.62, Yeah.
4111.62,4112.62, Just about being a junior high age male.
4112.62,4113.62, Just the impulsiveness.
4113.62,4118.14," I mean, I just remember just like growing up doing like the dumbest shit possible"
4118.14,4121.9," that as soon as you do it, like the moment that you do it, the first thing you think is like,"
4121.9,4124.0199999999995," oh, why did I do that?"
4124.0199999999995,4127.66," You know, you just, I don't know what's your magic like something."
4127.66,4132.66," Male, young male brain, not that like the older male brain is any better, but at"
4132.66,4135.74, least we like are willing to stop and think about something before we do it.
4135.74,4136.74, Yeah.
4136.74,4137.74, Incredibly stupid.
4137.74,4138.74," Well, you know how it is."
4138.74,4142.7, Like there's another set of friends we have where it's like dangerous to be with them
4142.7,4145.74, somewhere because they'll just start like talking to kind of shit that's going to get
4145.74,4147.7, them beat up and like you're there with them.
4147.7,4150.26," Like, I would like that was never my problem at all."
4150.26,4153.82," You know, it's like always a matter for the most part, like how can you do something"
4153.82,4156.26," in Naaka-Kakot, which just goes against the story."
4156.26,4160.5," I just gave you with like, do it in front of my friends with those things."
4160.5,4164.46," Well, like, whether there's that, but yeah, I think it's just like flirting with the"
4164.46,4165.46, trouble.
4165.46,4167.0199999999995," You know, like wanting to do what you're not supposed to."
4167.06,4171.38, It's instantly more entertaining than something that's expected of you or whatever.
4171.38,4172.38, Yeah.
4172.38,4173.38," So back to like, take it."
4173.38,4178.38," It's like the kids, you know, when you ask him, who would you want to play as the Federalist"
4178.38,4179.38, or the anti-Federalist?
4179.38,4180.38," Oh, the anti-Federalist."
4180.38,4181.38, Yeah.
4181.38,4182.38, No one.
4182.38,4183.38, But because it's anti-Federalist.
4183.38,4184.38, That was interesting.
4184.38,4186.900000000001," No one is going to admit to it's just a typical thing, right?"
4186.900000000001,4189.9400000000005, No one wants to admit to like a gap in their knowledge or something.
4189.9400000000005,4193.660000000001," So instead of saying, I really don't know the difference between the two."
4193.660000000001,4195.46," It's like, oh, definitely the Federalist."
4195.46,4197.66," In the same way of like, yeah, dude, you get to bomb Libya."
4197.66,4201.1," I mean, we could have been like, you know, this mission, you control it like you're on the"
4201.1,4202.5, head of the bomb.
4202.5,4204.3, You get to guide it right to its target.
4204.3,4207.62," And it's like, Zones, you don't tell them that the target is what the target was."
4207.62,4208.62, Yeah.
4208.62,4210.02," Like, that sounds great."
4210.02,4211.62," Honestly, that was the gap in my knowledge."
4211.62,4214.26," When you first told me that I was like, well, I don't know."
4214.26,4218.46," It's not really funny when you tell it for what it is, but just did a serity of like,"
4218.46,4220.1, the most inappropriate game.
4220.1,4221.1, Yeah.
4221.1,4222.82, Because I guess I guess the bomb hit the top.
4222.82,4223.82, It didn't off.
4223.82,4224.82, It didn't even have to be.
4224.82,4225.82, It didn't have to be.
4225.82,4226.82, It didn't have to be.
4226.82,4227.82," So yeah, now, but now we've ruined it."
4227.82,4236.82, It's not in our funny.
4236.82,4240.139999999999," Just last night, I started babbling about jab, the John Afro band."
4240.139999999999,4241.7," And I was like, I called Robert."
4241.7,4246.099999999999," I was asking you, like, if you had some means to get like an odd, like a set tape on"
4246.099999999999,4249.0199999999995," the digital, put it online and share with everyone."
4249.0199999999995,4252.62," And then as I was telling everyone, I've been tripping about this."
4252.62,4260.62," And this being that like, one of my friends and colleges, he grew up in, what is it?"
4260.62,4261.62, Palm Desert.
4261.62,4262.62, Yeah.
4262.62,4266.22, And he would go back on like one weekend a month or something.
4266.22,4270.099999999999," And in some guy that he had gone to high school with, well, this one friend Anthony"
4270.099999999999,4274.94," Sestich and then was like, you know, playing drums or something in Mike Blake guitar."
4274.94,4280.18," But they got this guy from their high school name, moment for the juror, he's a Haitian guy,"
4280.18,4284.26, but he had break damage because he was in a coma after being hit by a truck or so the story
4284.26,4285.26, went.
4285.26,4286.860000000001, And he was a singer.
4286.860000000001,4289.3, He wanted to be a singer for this band.
4289.3,4290.62," They made this, they cut this tape."
4290.62,4292.62, The thing is fucking crazy.
4292.62,4294.26," He was like, this name is John."
4294.26,4295.700000000001," Yeah, John knows his other name."
4295.700000000001,4297.700000000001, Outside is Haitian name.
4297.700000000001,4299.3, And then so he had like a song.
4299.3,4302.22," It's just like, called John and on and on and on."
4302.22,4308.5," He's just like, I'm John and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on"
4308.5,4309.5, and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
4309.5,4313.42, and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
4313.42,4315.02, It's like hardcore music.
4315.02,4316.02," Yeah, totally hard."
4316.02,4317.02, It sounds like a punkhead.
4317.02,4318.02, And totally.
4318.02,4323.46," The rattisting is he had these just like just delusions of grand or in talking about how, you"
4323.46,4326.1," know, he's like, who's the tough guy."
4326.1,4330.38," John, who's the hot shot, John, who's the muscle man."
4330.38,4333.78," John, I'm John Afro and I break you leg."
4333.78,4338.02, It like starts screaming and shit and.
4338.02,4340.660000000001," Meanwhile, they said it was creepy as how watching him sing."
4340.660000000001,4342.660000000001," He said, you take a shirt off and he's a really big dude."
4342.660000000001,4347.22," He just be rocking back and forth and sweating profusely, screaming and stuff."
4347.22,4350.34," And another idea is that they had him cover Louis Louis,"
4350.34,4352.5," which was like, if he was, unintelligible."
4352.5,4354.26, And he didn't know that lyrics of course either.
4354.26,4356.02," So it was like, doubly awesome."
4356.02,4358.740000000001," Very good to be doing the cover, cover of that."
4358.740000000001,4361.06, And another song was called Gordy.
4361.06,4364.34," And it was about Anthony's dog, I think,"
4364.34,4366.740000000001, and how he jacked it off one time.
4366.74,4370.66," But so, okay, as I'm telling about these songs,"
4370.66,4372.179999999999," it was just like, remembering."
4372.179999999999,4374.34," They did another one, Kelly at Alley."
4374.34,4378.58," This is because one of them had pictures of these girls from their school,"
4378.58,4380.98," like, after, you know, they'd graduate Kelly and Alley,"
4380.98,4384.82, who in the convince them to get naked and get in the shower and make out.
4384.82,4385.7, And he took some pictures.
4385.7,4387.54, So they showed John Afro this.
4387.54,4390.099999999999," And that was like, the really good shipper him."
4390.099999999999,4393.54, So he had a song about them and what he wanted to do with them.
4393.54,4395.54," And then also the main song to bring together,"
4395.54,4397.06, one called Post Office.
4397.06,4398.98," And that's because his dad was really protective,"
4398.98,4402.42, understandably so and didn't want him really hanging out with anyone.
4402.42,4404.98," Because Lord knows he didn't end up with Mike and Anthony,"
4404.98,4407.86, who had convinced him to be the singer of their man.
4407.86,4409.62, And so he was allowed to go to Post Office.
4409.62,4412.42, So that was his alibi for everything.
4412.42,4414.0199999999995," If you want to go to steal some cigarettes,"
4414.0199999999995,4414.9, you go to the Post Office.
4414.9,4417.46," If you wanted to go to smoke some buddy to go to the Post Office,"
4417.46,4419.7," you wanted to go to record an album, it was the Post Office."
4419.7,4425.46," So it's like, Post Office is the place I go to smoke some by."
4425.78,4427.14, To check the mail.
4427.14,4431.06, Post Office is a place I go to St. John's cigarettes.
4431.06,4433.22, To get weed.
4434.26,4434.9, It's okay.
4434.9,4438.18," As I'm wrapping up the story, all of a sudden invent I hear it."
4438.18,4440.18," And I was like, holy shit, what the fuck is that?"
4440.18,4441.22, Who's doing that?
4441.22,4444.18," And as I told it, they started searching online and sure enough,"
4444.18,4445.46, they found a Myspace for it.
4445.46,4449.38, So someone in the band put four of the songs up.
4449.38,4450.1, And you can hear him.
4450.1,4452.9, So it's under jab like the Mike John Afro band.
4452.9,4454.339999999999, I'm slash jab.
4454.339999999999,4455.0599999999995, Yeah.
4455.0599999999995,4456.66, But it's missing all the other songs.
4456.66,4458.98, And then they extended the interview afterwards.
4458.98,4461.0599999999995, So it's still worthwhile for me getting this put.
4461.0599999999995,4463.0599999999995," And the quality of mine, I think, is probably better."
4463.0599999999995,4466.58, But getting this up there because some of these songs are classics.
4467.299999999999,4467.78, Nice.
4512.9,4542.9, And the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is the first song is
