31.0,34.0," Before we go any further Ryan, are you done with your ice cream?"
34.0,35.0, Yeah.
35.0,36.0, Thanks.
36.0,40.0, We're all sitting here waiting from the stop chewing so we could podcast.
40.0,42.0, Thanks for bringing stuff down for us.
42.0,43.0, You're really consider it better.
43.0,45.0, Better bought four Sundays for us.
45.0,46.0, What the hell?
46.0,47.0, Yeah.
47.0,49.0, What the hell's right.
49.0,53.0, We're here down at Studio B.
53.0,58.0, Is it where we now call B for passages?
58.0,59.0, Yeah.
59.0,61.0," Not, I don't know."
61.0,62.0, I have no joke there.
62.0,68.0, But we have the regular studio up on our floor now where we're all happy and we like life.
68.0,71.0, And then we have the studio here where we're unhappy and hate life.
71.0,72.0, So if you...
72.0,73.0, It's all the room.
73.0,76.0, Proceed any extra negativity this week.
76.0,78.0, It's because we're in the shittole studio.
78.0,82.0, But you can blame the one of yours guys for taking all our equipment and jupy.
82.0,83.0," Oh, that's true."
83.0,85.0, It's all one up yours is fault.
85.0,86.0, Fuck you guys.
86.0,88.0," Yeah, because they're all in Tokyo."
88.0,89.0," Ooh, fancy."
89.0,91.0, We get to go to Tokyo in Kever Tokyo game show.
91.0,95.0, Please note that this studio is actually much nicer than the one we used to record it.
95.0,96.0," Well, it is."
96.0,97.0, But it's not our studio.
97.0,98.0," No, it's just not home."
98.0,99.0, That's all right.
99.0,100.0," It's not home, right."
100.0,104.0," The other one may be crap, but it's our crappy home."
104.0,106.0, It doesn't have soundproof walls.
106.0,107.0," Yeah, that's true."
107.0,110.0," This has all the accoutrements, but it lacks the soul."
110.0,111.0, You know?
112.0,114.0, It lacks what makes us us with.
114.0,115.0, I don't know what that is.
115.0,116.0, All right.
116.0,120.0," Anyway, we're here with most of the regulars."
120.0,122.0, Say who you are.
122.0,123.0, Ryan Scott.
123.0,124.0, Darren Gladstone.
124.0,125.0, Sean McCoy.
125.0,127.0, And Mr. Elliott is up at Valv.
127.0,128.0, Is he not?
128.0,129.0, He is.
129.0,130.0," Yes, he is."
130.0,132.0," He's a, it's not secret, right?"
132.0,133.0," No, not at all."
133.0,134.0, Okay.
134.0,135.0, He's up there playing at Orange Box right now.
135.0,137.0, So maybe I cannot wait.
137.0,139.0," Yeah, now I can't wait either."
139.0,142.0," I like episode one better than half life, too."
142.0,143.0, So.
143.0,145.0," And Mr. Gladstone, you've been playing a lot of TF2."
145.0,147.0, I heard you over there yelling today.
147.0,148.0," Yeah, it's awesome."
148.0,151.0," Well, first of all, I got to say anyone who's pre-ordered it and has it."
151.0,153.0," Now, like, if you look in your not installed list,"
153.0,154.0, Yeah.
154.0,157.0, You can actually download TF2 right now and get in on the beta.
157.0,159.0, So it's totally worth just checking out.
159.0,160.0, So it's an open beta.
160.0,161.0, It's open beta.
161.0,163.0," If you pre-ordered or if you have it or it's just,"
163.0,165.0, sit there waiting for you.
165.0,167.0," My big fear when I started playing it was, okay, I figured,"
167.0,171.0, I'm going to get my ass kicked so hard by all these guys who've been playing it forever.
171.0,172.0, Get in now.
172.0,174.0, That's all I got to say because it's actually pretty well balanced.
174.0,176.0, Guys aren't too hard chorea.
176.0,178.0," It's just, man, it's, I can't even go into,"
178.0,180.0," I managed to start by like, by class."
180.0,184.0," How much fun is I spent a couple matches playing as each class and like,"
184.0,186.0, by far the spy is the funniest.
186.0,187.0, Mm-hmm.
187.0,189.0, So I'd be faster the funnest.
189.0,194.0," Fun and well, it all depends because the way it's broken out by,"
194.0,196.0," you know, whether you want to take a defensive role at a"
196.0,200.0," offensive role or a support role, it's all just a matter of how you want to play it."
200.0,202.0, But I had a lot of fun playing as the spy.
202.0,205.0," I sucked at it and I got to work on it, but,"
205.0,206.0, Mm-hmm.
206.0,209.0," But I mean, the disguises, they work."
209.0,212.0," I mean, it's not as, I miss being able to faint death."
212.0,214.0," So you guys play TF1, right?"
214.0,216.0," So I mean, I really miss being able to faint death,"
216.0,220.0, but being able to walk around and just clone and look like one of the other guys.
220.0,222.0," And the funny thing is to hear teammates,"
222.0,224.0," I mean, the art style really does sell the whole thing."
224.0,225.0, So it's your teammates.
225.0,228.0," The spy looks like he has like a loosely, loosely,"
228.0,232.0, notebook page with a picture of the character he's playing takes his face.
232.0,233.0, Mm-hmm.
233.0,234.0, So it's just-
234.0,236.0," But the other side, CZU, as one of them."
236.0,237.0, Yeah.
237.0,238.0, Mm-hmm.
238.0,239.0," Let me, I'm just trying to think like some base."
239.0,240.0, So I played-
240.0,242.0, So you're buying into the whole art style of this thing.
242.0,243.0, The art style really does sell it.
243.0,246.0," I mean, like you'd see guys across the, you could tell from the outline across the"
246.0,248.0," map who they are, what they're, what they're, what they're character,"
248.0,249.0, or she can kind of prepare.
249.0,253.0," There's a lot of environmental cues so you can know what's going on,"
253.0,257.0, like you see your red dot on a wall is a sniper aiming at you across the map.
257.0,258.0, Mm-hmm.
258.0,262.0," And I really, I mean, I should preface this by saying that I,"
262.0,265.0," it's been a long, long time since I played TF."
265.0,266.0, Mm-hmm.
266.0,269.0," I have wooded TF forever and I guess because I, because I fell so out of the loop,"
269.0,271.0, I got my ASCII and every match I walked into.
271.0,273.0, So now I'm playing this.
273.0,275.0," It's a lot of fun, man."
275.0,276.0, Yeah.
276.0,277.0, Yeah.
277.0,278.0," Now won't last, so you'll start getting your ass."
278.0,279.0," I mean, it's-"
279.0,281.0," I think it's been a long, but the fun wasn't going to last."
281.0,282.0," Oh, the fun?"
282.0,283.0," Yeah, maybe the fun."
283.0,284.0, The fun never stops.
284.0,285.0, The fun never stops.
285.0,286.0, The team for just to-
286.0,287.0," Hey, yeah."
287.0,289.0, We're talking about team for just you.
289.0,294.0, I just like to point out that the beta went live at 11.50 pm Pacific Standard Time.
294.0,295.0, Yeah.
295.0,296.0, Yeah.
296.0,299.0," And I already saw full reviews on certain sites online,"
299.0,302.0, when I walked in at 9.30 am this morning.
302.0,303.0, What are you saying Ryan?
303.0,308.0," So you want to see how good TF2 is, you know, just do some research on the internet."
308.0,309.0, Okay.
309.0,310.0," But then again, some-"
310.0,311.0, What do you implying?
312.0,313.0, Now you can.
313.0,314.0, I mentioned professional reviews.
314.0,316.0, Just letting people know if they're reviews.
316.0,319.0," Well, there are- there are reviews in a number of places already."
319.0,320.0," It- well, that's always- that's me."
320.0,322.0, We kind of talked about this before.
322.0,324.0," And actually, we talked about it a lot before."
324.0,325.0, And just last week.
325.0,326.0, And yet exactly that's our own fact.
326.0,328.0, We'll keep talking about it every week.
328.0,329.0, Yeah.
329.0,331.0," No, and our point, all reviews suck but ours."
331.0,334.0," So it's a valid point, Jeff."
334.0,335.0," Here, here."
335.0,336.0, I'll probably move to the wrong.
336.0,340.0, But yeah.
340.0,342.0, There have been her happen reviews.
342.0,345.0," And you know, if the game is great, then they're right."
345.0,346.0, Aren't they?
346.0,347.0, Hmm.
347.0,348.0, Guess so?
348.0,350.0, Can't argue with that.
350.0,354.0," Well, I'm looking forward to playing it."
354.0,356.0, I- I really can't wait.
356.0,357.0, I can't wait either.
357.0,358.0, Yeah.
358.0,360.0, I- I- I- I'm one of the ones who didn't play Team Fortress at all.
360.0,361.0, Uh-huh.
361.0,365.0," I've never since my little valve trip when I played it for just like, you know, a couple hours."
365.0,367.0," I've been like, I got to get that game."
367.0,368.0, I got to get that game.
368.0,371.0, I don't know what it is because normally that kind of thing just doesn't have any
371.0,372.0, you feel so poor there.
372.0,374.0," Well, just the fun shading."
374.0,375.0, Yeah.
375.0,377.0, It makes it or breaks it.
377.0,378.0, No.
378.0,380.0," I gotta tell you, I'm probably just going to keep playing the game as a support"
380.0,381.0, all the whole time.
381.0,383.0, I thought it's just so much fun doing that kind of stuff.
383.0,386.0," Well, so that was doing what I was playing at Valve as I was medic."
386.0,387.0, Yeah.
387.0,388.0, Yeah.
388.0,389.0, Yeah.
389.0,390.0," And that's just so much more my thing, I guess."
390.0,393.0," Well, it's just definitely if you're just not, you know,"
393.0,397.0," if you're not the aggressive shooter type guy, I mean,"
397.0,400.0, you'll just get your S kicked anyway.
400.0,404.0," You know, I mean, if you try to play it that way, so the support roles really are,"
404.0,407.0, can be great if you're just not inclined to want to play that.
407.0,410.0," It's fun to be behind the really good progressive guy and go,"
410.0,413.0, I healed him the whole time and made that possible.
413.0,416.0," And you get points for that too, right?"
416.0,417.0," Obviously, you must."
417.0,418.0," Well, yeah."
418.0,420.0," I mean, obviously, if you're playing a medic, you are kind of scored,"
420.0,424.0," quote, unquote, differently than the guy with the giant chain gun."
424.0,426.0," You know, I think about it."
426.0,428.0," Like, you know, it's going to spark back as planet side."
428.0,430.0, Like any game where there was a support role.
430.0,433.0," If I'm myself doing that more and more often because I don't know,"
433.0,436.0," if I find it's a, you know, contributing to a greater larger effort."
436.0,437.0, It's very noble.
437.0,439.0, The funny idea.
439.0,444.0," I did a, a little panel talk at UC Berkeley yesterday with a couple guys."
444.0,449.0, And one of the guys on there was one of the main developers from planet side.
449.0,453.0, He's actually at cryptic now working on cryptic's next game.
453.0,454.0, And I'm sorry.
454.0,456.0, I just can't remember his name.
456.0,457.0," Now, but he's a very cool guy."
457.0,458.0, Is it a George song?
458.0,459.0, I do.
459.0,464.0, Dave Steve Joe Tom Larry.
464.0,465.0, You are awesome.
465.0,466.0, One of those.
466.0,467.0, Yeah.
467.0,468.0, I don't know.
468.0,469.0," Anyway, a fine fellow."
469.0,474.0, And he was talking a lot about a planet side and it reminded me how a great
474.0,478.0, and ahead of time that ahead of its time that game was.
478.0,481.0," You know, but he, he was saying that I'm bringing this up because he was saying"
481.0,486.0, that like the idea is that plan is side had really kind of only coming to fruition
486.0,490.0, right now because it's kind of like the technology caught up with what plan is
490.0,492.0, like was trying to do back then.
492.0,497.0," You know, now with, with broadband, everybody can really play that way."
497.0,502.0," You know, like the idea of a massive multiplayer FPS is something that actually can be done"
502.0,507.0," now, whereas back in that time, it was still there were still like horrible server load issues."
507.0,508.0, Like that.
508.0,512.0," And I know TF2 isn't, isn't mass multiplayer, so these are kind of two different things."
512.0,513.0, Yeah.
513.0,515.0," I feel, I feel, my point is mood therefore."
515.0,519.0, I'm going to stop talking now.
519.0,522.0, Don't move towards the joy of it.
522.0,526.0," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
526.0,528.0, And that is my book report.
528.0,529.0, Yeah.
529.0,532.0, Bye Jeff Green.
532.0,536.0," Now that the whole oned box thingy, well, I think we've been over this before, but I need to clarify"
536.0,540.0," to my own mind is only a retail issue, right?"
540.0,541.0, If I just go to Steve.
541.0,546.0," Yes, I could just buy, I could just buy portal if that's all I wanted."
546.0,548.0, Or I could just buy a team for just a little.
548.0,549.0," Well, it all comes together."
549.0,553.0," I mean, they're going to have a variety of package options if you buy it."
553.0,554.0, On Steam.
554.0,557.0," I don't know what those are, but it's going to be more than just."
557.0,559.0, I can't just go all I cart.
559.0,560.0, Maybe.
560.0,562.0, I can't imagine them not letting you do it.
562.0,563.0, I don't really know.
563.0,564.0, Yeah.
564.0,565.0, I'm not seeing that.
565.0,566.0, I should be able to.
566.0,567.0," Yeah, I don't know."
567.0,572.0, Because I still find the whole oned box got set a little bit annoying.
572.0,576.0," Even though, I mean, the way I'll get it is by downloading it in the first place."
576.0,579.0, I still am not buying into their whole.
579.0,586.0," Well, now you have a half-life too to give away to somebody thing, because who has not played that at this point."
586.0,588.0," I don't, I don't buy it."
588.0,592.0, I wish they had kept a skew that was just that did not include that.
592.0,594.0, I like to tell you people who haven't played it yet.
594.0,596.0, There's a lot of people there.
596.0,597.0, Yeah.
597.0,600.0," I think the price of this thing just isn't, it's why I'm not getting angry at it because"
600.0,602.0," I'm just like, okay, so it's 50 bucks."
602.0,603.0, Yeah.
603.0,604.0, Price of an old game.
604.0,605.0, Plus you get it.
605.0,607.0," No, I'm like a charging 80 year, something for all three."
607.0,609.0," Yeah, I guess I get that."
609.0,610.0, I do.
610.0,615.0," I just, maybe it's because I like already have three different copies of half-life too."
615.0,616.0, That's fine.
616.0,619.0, I didn't know that I would have yet another one if I was buying the box.
619.0,621.0," You know, stop giving me that game."
621.0,623.0, Are you going to buy the box?
623.0,624.0," Well, are you going to steam it?"
624.0,625.0," No, I think I'm going to steam it."
625.0,627.0, I got partially because of that though.
627.0,628.0, What?
628.0,630.0," I'm told, I'm just saying, I'm totally steaming it from no one."
630.0,636.0," I mean, I've recently, I lost a whole, a whole pile of discs that I use for testing stuff."
636.0,637.0, Yeah.
637.0,639.0, And that's when I realized a crap.
639.0,641.0, That steam would totally come in handy right about now.
641.0,642.0, Yeah.
642.0,644.0, Dix are to past.
644.0,645.0, They are to past.
645.0,648.0, And I make the whole mortgage box thing makes a much sense for consoles.
649.0,652.0, And the fact that you get half-life too in there because it's something that...
652.0,657.0," You know, actually, I don't know if this is true enough, but I heard that the up-the-tex-years for half-life won."
657.0,659.0," I mean, half-life too, you know, probably."
659.0,662.0," Well, yeah, I know it's got like HD-HRN stuff."
662.0,666.0," And Sean was saying there's a couple, like I guess the mortgage on still a little better,"
666.0,667.0, because their textures are increased.
667.0,674.0, I'm not entirely sure what specifically they made better for the Xbox 360 version than some better stuff.
674.0,677.0," So if you haven't played before, you're going to get the..."
678.0,679.0, It might be where the...
679.0,681.0," The anti-stition version, um, console."
681.0,682.0, Okay.
682.0,684.0," I don't know if they did that for PC2 though, did they?"
684.0,686.0," Um, to patch, I believe."
686.0,687.0, Did it patch?
687.0,688.0," No, okay."
688.0,690.0," Yeah, they're always patching it, yeah."
690.0,691.0, You know.
691.0,692.0, Yay.
692.0,695.0," So it's still not out for reals though for a little while, right?"
695.0,697.0, A few weeks early October.
697.0,698.0, October or second?
698.0,699.0," I think, right?"
699.0,701.0, The second or seventh?
701.0,704.0," Well, either way, it's going to be a really unproductive October for me."
704.0,707.0, I will be playing half-life 2 episode 2.
707.0,711.0," The second I get it in my hands, and we'll not stop till I'm done."
711.0,713.0," Is that a promise, Jiren?"
713.0,715.0, I'm telling you this now.
715.0,717.0," And I mean, swear to our audience."
717.0,718.0, I swear.
718.0,719.0," And warning you, what?"
719.0,720.0, Have you been by our jacket?
720.0,725.0, I shall knock each until episode 2 has been beaten.
725.0,726.0, What?
726.0,728.0, Here's a little bit of a...
728.0,730.0, Did I really get it back to the acting from a moment ago?
730.0,731.0, Yeah.
731.0,733.0, Did you beat the bio-shaket?
733.0,736.0," Well, no, I haven't, but I'm so close."
736.0,738.0, I'm a...
738.0,741.0," Well, well past spoiler expiration date."
741.0,744.0, I would say we are not past this spoiler.
744.0,745.0, We're not native.
745.0,746.0, Can you have a beat it?
746.0,748.0, I think there are other people.
748.0,749.0, Okay.
749.0,750.0, So I'm very far...
750.0,752.0, I believe I am at the end boss.
752.0,753.0, Okay.
753.0,754.0, Let's say that.
754.0,755.0, You believe...
755.0,756.0, I believe I am.
756.0,757.0," Finish that, dammit."
757.0,758.0," Yeah, I'm trying."
758.0,762.0," But actually, I'm distracted because I've been playing that on the 360 as I've admitted."
762.0,766.0, As I've admitted before on this podcast to my undershame.
766.0,770.0," But, but every time I get on the 360 now, I'm actually distracted by the..."
770.0,773.0, Call of Duty 4 multiplayer beta still.
773.0,774.0, Stop it.
774.0,775.0, Yeah.
775.0,776.0, What do I have to say?
776.0,778.0," Because I, last time on this podcast, I kind of disted it."
778.0,781.0, And then I ended up blogging about it later because...
781.0,782.0, Because I...
782.0,787.0," After you get over a certain hump in the beginning of Call of Duty 4,"
787.0,790.0," it really, at least for me, it really kind of..."
790.0,792.0, A switch flipped.
792.0,795.0, And I really got into it and I've been into it ever since.
795.0,798.0, So weird way to design if that's the reaction you had is like...
798.0,800.0," I don't like it now, but then..."
800.0,801.0," You have a later, you like it?"
801.0,802.0, We're going to force you to...
802.0,804.0," Well, some pain before you like it."
804.0,805.0," Well, and what happened?"
805.0,809.0," In a way, if you think about it, it's kind of how an MMO works, right?"
809.0,812.0," I mean, you know, even if they throw you, you know,"
812.0,816.0," the early carrots in an MMO, level 1, 2, 3."
816.0,818.0," I mean, it doesn't get really great"
818.0,820.0, and take a strike getting a really cool...
820.0,822.0, uh... powers and abilities.
822.0,824.0, Right. And that's exactly how...
824.0,825.0, Call of Duty 4 works.
825.0,828.0," I mean, they've designed the multiplayer, essentially, like an MMO."
828.0,830.0, So isn't this going to be...
830.0,831.0, Isn't this going to...
831.0,833.0," Just care people away, I guess?"
833.0,834.0, Because it's like...
834.0,837.0, If you come into the game and all these people have these great powers.
837.0,838.0, Yeah. And you don't...
838.0,839.0, Yeah.
839.0,840.0, Yeah.
840.0,842.0, Don't necessarily realize that working up...
842.0,843.0, Right.
843.0,844.0, Or how long it'll take to work up to those powers.
844.0,845.0, Right.
845.0,846.0, And it's like...
846.0,847.0, Oh.
847.0,849.0, I don't know how I worked there.
849.0,850.0," Well, it's a..."
850.0,851.0, It's a level.
851.0,854.0," It's mostly a beta problem, I think."
854.0,855.0, We talked about this a little.
855.0,860.0, I was talking with Kathleen Sanders and Skip on the one-up show about it.
860.0,861.0, Because it's mostly a problem of...
861.0,864.0," In the beta right now, they don't have..."
864.0,867.0," There's matchmaking, but they don't have it..."
867.0,868.0, Uh...
868.0,871.0," All... you know, it's not complete yet."
871.0,873.0, So they don't have server restrictions yet.
873.0,878.0," So right now, you can be a level two new, been in-up in a match with the level four..."
878.0,880.0, The current cap is 16.
880.0,881.0, Mm-hmm.
881.0,882.0, And so that sucks.
882.0,883.0, Yes.
883.0,886.0," Because you are... you know, this is a game where..."
886.0,889.0," The more you play, the stronger you get, the more abilities you get."
889.0,892.0, And just... the easier it is to stay alive in the kill people.
892.0,896.0," So obviously, when you come into the level one, it's like, grossly unfair to you."
896.0,901.0," So yes, it is intimidating and a bit of a drag when you first get in."
901.0,907.0," But I think the assurance is that when the game is really live, when you go in as a new,"
907.0,909.0, you'll only be playing against other news.
909.0,910.0, So...
910.0,912.0," You know, the server will scale up."
912.0,914.0, The matchmaking will scale up.
914.0,917.0," Okay, so you're leveling up as you're playing and that level..."
917.0,919.0," You know, just continues on between matches."
919.0,921.0," Yeah, you can level up during a match."
921.0,923.0," You know, you'll see a thing."
923.0,925.0, You've been promoted to Staff Sergeant.
925.0,926.0, Right.
926.0,927.0, So you play.
927.0,930.0," So it's like BF2, for example, where, like, you know, multiple games, multiple times."
930.0,932.0, You keep leveling up like you would in an MMO.
932.0,938.0," Right. And what's also awesome, too, is that you get multiple challenges they call them."
938.0,940.0, But they're essentially achievements.
940.0,943.0," You know, they're exactly like an Xbox Live achievement."
943.0,945.0, But built into the game for all sorts of different things.
945.0,948.0, And you'll unlock more of those as you keep playing.
948.0,953.0, So you hit a certain level and you're playing a certain character class.
953.0,957.0, And you'll hit some milestone where a new challenge will open up.
957.0,962.0," And the challenge will be like, okay, kill 30, get 30 kills with this gun."
962.0,964.0, And then that will give you some other perk.
964.0,969.0," And the perk might be a piece of camouflage, or, you know, red dot for your sight."
969.0,970.0, Different things.
970.0,974.0," So they constantly give you incentives to not just be in the matches,"
974.0,978.0, but also to try certain character classes or certain weapons.
978.0,982.0," Like, I've seen these guys walk around in this like awesome camouflage."
982.0,985.0," You know, it's basically like a suit of leaves, you know."
985.0,986.0, That's like God damn it.
986.0,987.0, I'm level 16.
987.0,988.0, How do I get that?
988.0,990.0," I'm like, I'll already as high as I can go."
990.0,991.0, And I don't know how to get it.
991.0,993.0," So I searched who the challenges and it's sure enough,"
993.0,995.0, it was doing a certain activity.
995.0,997.0, I think it was like 30 headshots or something.
997.0,999.0, You will unlock that.
999.0,1001.0, The ability to equip that camouflage on yourself.
1001.0,1005.0," So the cool thing there is like, and I really haven't seen it in another."
1005.0,1011.0, Shooter type game to this extent where they're giving you constant.
1012.0,1019.0," Individual goals as well as just the team, you know, the team goals or a specific match at school."
1019.0,1021.0, That can be counterproductive too because.
1021.0,1023.0," Yeah, I was just thinking, you shot it right away."
1023.0,1024.0," Yeah, I've had a run."
1024.0,1027.0, I had that exact and they were not even giving you necessarily anything in the game.
1027.0,1031.0," It was just giving you the achievement, you know, for on 100, 100,"
1031.0,1033.0, heels or a million heel points or whatever.
1033.0,1034.0," Yeah, trees."
1034.0,1038.0," But that game is, they were games where people were just like putting up the trees everywhere."
1038.0,1039.0," And I'm like, what the hell's going on?"
1039.0,1040.0, Yeah.
1040.0,1041.0, The team and the team.
1041.0,1043.0," Okay, there's definitely some of that."
1043.0,1044.0, There is.
1044.0,1046.0," I mean, I don't think there's anything that we so far."
1046.0,1052.0, I haven't seen anything that seems the billitating to team play except maybe for like excessive sniping.
1052.0,1054.0, Except that's probably going to happen in the future.
1054.0,1055.0, Right.
1055.0,1059.0," I mean, there's guys who are just sniping all the time because that's all they fucking do because they're cowards."
1059.0,1061.0, But I didn't say that.
1061.0,1063.0, That was snipers are cool.
1063.0,1064.0, You guys are great.
1064.0,1066.0," Yeah, you just stay up there by the window for two hours."
1066.0,1068.0, You fucking can't fix.
1068.0,1069.0, Do what you do?
1069.0,1072.0, Cypers are like the most badass guys because they're just there just and they're there.
1072.0,1073.0," Oh, no."
1073.0,1074.0, They're one shot.
1074.0,1078.0, Nothing pisses me off in the kill camp.
1078.0,1083.0, Get out there and fight.
1083.0,1089.0, I have friends who are like that who they either like play to sniper and I think they're just so badass.
1089.0,1092.0, Like the dude from like enemy at the gates or whatever.
1092.0,1093.0, Yeah.
1093.0,1094.0, Yeah.
1094.0,1096.0, Everyone has the name Vasily.
1096.0,1097.0, Right.
1097.0,1100.0, I can imagine like this guy sitting at his home has his feet kicked up.
1100.0,1105.0, One hand on the mouse with a beard and a beard and a joy and a joy and a joy and a joy and a joy.
1105.0,1111.0," I think it's fine to do it for a little bit, you know, in any particular match, but not the whole time."
1111.0,1113.0, But that's the great thing about the kill camp.
1113.0,1114.0, Right.
1114.0,1116.0, You get to see the guy and then go after.
1116.0,1117.0, Your cams are wonderful.
1117.0,1118.0, Yeah.
1118.0,1119.0, They really are.
1119.0,1121.0, This is the best part is going after that guy.
1121.0,1124.0," Which, you know, petty, but I do it."
1124.0,1125.0, Yeah.
1125.0,1126.0, That's revenge.
1126.0,1130.0," And I felt like I'm dissoned the whole thing, but I think it's actually, if this is really well implemented."
1130.0,1131.0, Yeah.
1131.0,1132.0, I'm dying for something like that.
1132.0,1135.0," So far, I really, it does really feel that way."
1135.0,1140.0," I mean, it gave me that's why I kept going back because because of the incentive to do more."
1140.0,1144.0," I mean, and of course, you know, you get more points if your team wins."
1144.0,1147.0," I mean, you know, there's the bragging rights of your team winning."
1147.0,1153.0," So I don't think there's anything like I don't think the individual goals are counter to, you know,"
1154.0,1157.0, will detract from the team goals.
1157.0,1158.0, Yeah.
1158.0,1159.0, That's good.
1159.0,1160.0, Yeah.
1160.0,1161.0, At least so far.
1161.0,1162.0, At least what I've seen.
1162.0,1164.0," And it all depends on individuals too, obviously."
1164.0,1165.0, Right.
1165.0,1170.0," And last week, I was also dissoning a lot of the, you know, just the fact of the, like, the"
1170.0,1173.0, horrid voice chat going on.
1173.0,1175.0, And I figured out the big answer to that one.
1175.0,1177.0, It didn't take me that long.
1177.0,1179.0, Take the headphones off.
1180.0,1184.0," So I actually have them plugged in, but like, load on my neck."
1184.0,1187.0," So I can sort of hear, but it's just sort of like background chat, right?"
1187.0,1190.0, Just here this little very tiny and teeny like you do.
1190.0,1194.0," You know, but is it, is there any, like, filter out, like, stuff."
1194.0,1198.0, So you can only hear your teammates at least or what you do only hear your team.
1198.0,1199.0," Oh, great."
1199.0,1200.0, It's a team.
1200.0,1201.0, Yeah.
1201.0,1202.0," Like, it's another."
1202.0,1205.0," Have you ever play, okay, so you're playing a team game on the, yeah, so I have you ever played,"
1205.0,1207.0," playing with, playing with, playing with strangers."
1207.0,1210.0," Yes, actually done some sort of a coordinated team activity."
1210.0,1215.0, But didn't involve just one person telling everyone else what to do and no one listening.
1215.0,1217.0," Yeah, now think about it."
1217.0,1218.0," Yeah, yeah, that's not really."
1218.0,1219.0," Yeah, actually I have."
1219.0,1220.0, You have.
1220.0,1221.0, You have.
1221.0,1223.0, And the strangest thing was actually in shadow run of all things.
1223.0,1224.0, Huh.
1224.0,1227.0, It was actually relatively coordinated for about five matches.
1227.0,1230.0, And then the guys that were good that were playing got tired of it and left.
1230.0,1231.0, Mm-hmm.
1231.0,1233.0, And then I just evolved into resume.
1233.0,1236.0," It did, it did happen occasionally in shadow run too."
1236.0,1237.0, But it's so rare.
1237.0,1238.0, Yeah.
1238.0,1241.0," It's not necessarily like, you know, complicated maneuvering."
1241.0,1242.0," Yeah, I know."
1242.0,1244.0," It's like, I have the flag."
1244.0,1246.0," But you know, okay, but I'm going to follow you then."
1246.0,1248.0," But wow, we cooperated."
1248.0,1252.0," But you take for granted, like basic communication skills can really help."
1252.0,1255.0," Like, okay, I need someone to cover my back while I'm going down to me."
1255.0,1259.0," Yeah, when you're in an environment where you want to take off your headset, obviously."
1259.0,1262.0, That sort of thing is in very.
1262.0,1265.0," Yeah, I mean, you know, when you're just playing the game and people seem"
1265.0,1268.0, like they're pretty good at the game and they are pretty good.
1268.0,1273.0," And you're just, you know, watching the game and listening to the sounds of the game."
1273.0,1278.0," It all seems like, wow, I'm playing with like 12 intelligent people and we're all like doing this stuff."
1278.0,1281.0," But then you put on the headphones and it's like, what am I doing?"
1281.0,1287.0," Who I like, how about if I come over there and kick your fucking ass asshole?"
1287.0,1290.0, I play it as in the other day and what you call an asshole.
1290.0,1291.0, You're an asshole.
1291.0,1293.0," Oh, tell you what."
1294.0,1296.0," You baby, rape whatever."
1296.0,1297.0, I didn't want to go.
1297.0,1299.0," One guy was saying like, one guy actually said,"
1299.0,1302.0," these two guys are young and you saw that on my team and they were, you know,"
1302.0,1307.0," one guy was going to kick the other guy's ass and no, he was going to kill him and blah, blah, blah,"
1307.0,1310.0," and then this, you know, and then the proof like he was the, you know,"
1310.0,1315.0," the bigger man he goes, I'll tell you what I rape guys for a living."
1315.0,1318.0," That's what I do and I was like, you do?"
1318.0,1320.0, How's that thing?
1321.0,1325.0," Yeah. And then the car's the response was, you rape animals for a living."
1325.0,1328.0," So, you know, that was that's a level of discourse that's,"
1328.0,1329.0, yeah.
1329.0,1330.0, I'm dealing with that.
1330.0,1331.0, Is it Salved or hourly?
1331.0,1333.0, Mr. you are gay.
1333.0,1334.0, Yeah.
1334.0,1335.0, There's the expulsory six.
1335.0,1339.0, You have some sort of reporting mechanism that actually works.
1339.0,1340.0," Well, I think you can."
1340.0,1341.0, Can you?
1341.0,1342.0, I don't know.
1342.0,1344.0," You know what they need is some kind of like, you've been like, we've poured it."
1344.0,1346.0, It's not that the stars are.
1346.0,1347.0, That is the star.
1347.0,1348.0," Yeah, you're right."
1348.0,1349.0, But they need to have it.
1349.0,1352.0, They need to make it so that like when you get down to certain levels.
1352.0,1353.0, Like it just eliminates.
1353.0,1355.0, It bars you from certain features.
1355.0,1358.0," Like once you get down below certain level, like you cannot use your headset anymore."
1358.0,1359.0, Yeah.
1359.0,1360.0, I don't know.
1360.0,1363.0," I mean, if you're playing a multiplayer shooter, you know,"
1363.0,1367.0," and I mean, that's like, I'm wasn't surprised to hear that stuff."
1367.0,1368.0, It's what I'm saying.
1368.0,1370.0, You're throwing yourself into that and make some guns.
1370.0,1371.0, Of course.
1371.0,1372.0, That's what you're going to get.
1372.0,1374.0, I don't like we're talking about anything new here.
1374.0,1375.0, Right.
1375.0,1377.0, I'm not a gathering of the men's or society.
1377.0,1382.0," You know, discussing the new, you know, Thomas Pinchon book."
1382.0,1384.0," Oh, how cool would that be?"
1384.0,1387.0, You're playing a multiplayer.
1387.0,1389.0, Yeah.
1389.0,1392.0, Suppose you are shooting a fucking face.
1392.0,1395.0, So let's talk about this new David Sedaris book.
1395.0,1396.0, Yeah.
1396.0,1397.0, So yeah.
1397.0,1400.0," So from now on, that's me on Call of Duty 4."
1400.0,1401.0, No headset.
1401.0,1402.0, Yeah.
1403.0,1404.0, Let me see.
1404.0,1406.0," Anyway, I'm playing the Helgate beta."
1406.0,1408.0, Just went up the other day.
1408.0,1409.0, I've sure been thinking about point.
1409.0,1412.0, I've been thinking of downloading the beta.
1412.0,1413.0, It is kind of beta week.
1413.0,1415.0, We're a little bit overwhelmed with beta's.
1415.0,1416.0, Yeah.
1416.0,1417.0, We've got that.
1417.0,1418.0, We've got universal war.
1418.0,1420.0, Universal war crisis coming out later this week.
1420.0,1421.0, Right.
1421.0,1423.0," And wait, do we have not world in conflict?"
1423.0,1425.0, We started to play in the same university.
1425.0,1426.0, Universal war.
1426.0,1427.0, Universal war.
1427.0,1428.0, I mixed those two games up.
1428.0,1429.0, I'm going to do it for forever.
1429.0,1431.0, How about how we supposed to get a one story?
1431.0,1433.0, It's the universe that's at war.
1433.0,1435.0, The world is just in conflict.
1435.0,1436.0, It's a mere conflict.
1436.0,1437.0, Right.
1437.0,1440.0," I need a, you know, I need a anemonic for that."
1440.0,1442.0, My very educated.
1442.0,1443.0, Whatever.
1443.0,1446.0," I guess that's the better game, huh?"
1446.0,1447.0, Universal.
1447.0,1448.0, Because they trumped it.
1448.0,1449.0," Oh, sure."
1449.0,1451.0, That game has a world in conflict.
1451.0,1452.0, It's just one world.
1452.0,1453.0, We have a universe.
1453.0,1454.0, It's a game.
1454.0,1456.0, It's also a universe that we're calling earth assault.
1456.0,1457.0, Aha.
1457.0,1458.0, See.
1458.0,1459.0, The one in conflict.
1459.0,1460.0, Have a colon.
1460.0,1461.0," You know, that's something."
1461.0,1462.0, It's just world in conflict.
1462.0,1464.0, I'll see that game sucks.
1464.0,1465.0, They blew it.
1465.0,1468.0, I'm sorry.
1468.0,1469.0, I got nothing.
1469.0,1472.0," We were, we're floking."
1472.0,1473.0, We're fired up.
1473.0,1474.0, I'll get you this today.
1474.0,1475.0, How gay.
1475.0,1476.0, Yeah.
1476.0,1478.0, Is this really the next Diablo?
1478.0,1479.0, Yeah.
1479.0,1480.0, You know what?
1480.0,1482.0," It's actually, it's got me thinking just speak."
1482.0,1483.0, I'll get to that.
1483.0,1485.0, Get to that question in a second.
1485.0,1487.0," It's not quite the next Diablo,"
1487.0,1489.0, but it is something it is different enough for me to want to keep.
1489.0,1491.0, It's been hearing mixed things.
1491.0,1492.0, It's a big deal.
1492.0,1493.0, Okay.
1493.0,1494.0, So the DX.
1494.0,1502.0," People are probably basing this off of like the alpha, which I've been playing up until recently."
1502.0,1504.0, And the alpha was just like low res textures.
1504.0,1505.0, Still kind of buggy.
1505.0,1506.0," And you know, it's early."
1506.0,1507.0, Yeah.
1507.0,1508.0, It's not launching.
1508.0,1509.0, It's not that early though.
1509.0,1510.0, I'm a big guy.
1510.0,1511.0, Yeah.
1511.0,1512.0, Yeah.
1512.0,1513.0, It's not that early.
1513.0,1515.0, But still like there's doing a lot of bugs quashing.
1515.0,1516.0, Sure.
1516.0,1518.0, And it's not coming out the next month.
1518.0,1525.0, And the different character classes play the game feels very different depending on each one you play with.
1525.0,1531.0," So I've so far played as the the hunters, like the first person shooter style."
1531.0,1532.0, Mm-hmm.
1532.0,1535.0, And I've played as the summoners and also the blade masters.
1535.0,1537.0, So I've got a good taste of each.
1537.0,1538.0, And I don't know.
1538.0,1539.0, There's something about it.
1539.0,1540.0, It just doesn't.
1540.0,1544.0," Diablo, the thing about Diablo is it was actually kind of simple to control."
1544.0,1545.0, And it was just.
1545.0,1547.0, And you kind of you collect on monsters.
1547.0,1548.0," I was like, I'm on monster that."
1548.0,1549.0, I was.
1549.0,1550.0," Oh, did."
1550.0,1552.0, I wonder what I wonder is.
1552.0,1557.0, What I wonder is if enough people might because there's a lot more things to tweak and modify.
1557.0,1560.0," And it's a lot more MMO-ish, but it's definitely."
1560.0,1561.0, It's a lot more.
1561.0,1563.0, It's a level of complex and a Diablo was back in the day.
1563.0,1569.0, Do you think that might kind of be a more of a barrier of entry for someone who hadn't considered playing before?
1569.0,1570.0, I don't know.
1570.0,1571.0, I don't know.
1571.0,1572.0, Because I was happy appeal of the Diablo games.
1572.0,1574.0, I was just so brainlessly simple.
1574.0,1575.0, Right.
1575.0,1578.0," I mean, if you if you don't know."
1578.0,1584.0," Helgate, the team making Helgate actually was the exact team that made Diablo one and two."
1584.0,1593.0," This, this, most of the guys from a, from flagship studios are refugees of Blizzard North, which was the company that made that."
1593.0,1596.0, So this is for all intensive purposes.
1596.0,1599.0, The next game from the people who made Diablo.
1599.0,1604.0," So yeah, the one thing I will say is that it's not, I mean, don't make any mistakes and think this is a first person shooter."
1604.0,1605.0, It really isn't.
1605.0,1609.0," Well, yeah, I was watching you playing the first person shooter thing."
1609.0,1614.0," And it certainly didn't, like, the speed just wasn't like the kind of you to come up with the first person shooter."
1614.0,1617.0," There wasn't, you know, people are stuck in behind cover or anything."
1617.0,1620.0," Well, at least what I saw you playing against is lumbering monster."
1620.0,1621.0," Well, yeah, I was funny."
1621.0,1624.0," Like, like, basically these giant, like, it's like, demonic, you know,"
1624.0,1625.0, Purdue chickens are something.
1625.0,1629.0, They just kind of like rolled down the street and made a chickens.
1629.0,1630.0, Exactly.
1630.0,1631.0, Pluck chickens.
1631.0,1635.0," Like, you know, it looks like it looks like the, you're about to go to KFC."
1635.0,1637.0," Evil, evil KFC chickens coming at you."
1637.0,1642.0," I guess that'd be a little bit about, you know, flesh, gold, of warcraft monsters and their behavior."
1642.0,1644.0," Which is just like, I have aggro on you."
1644.0,1645.0, So I am next to you now.
1645.0,1647.0," Well, it's kind of funny."
1647.0,1655.0," The, the blood zombies in the beginning of Hellgate have a lot in common with the, with the, with the Italians at the beginning of, middle of honor, everyone."
1655.0,1656.0, What is this?
1656.0,1658.0," It's a big, it's a big Italian brethren."
1659.0,1661.0," Hey, hey, I'm married to an Italian. I can say it."
1661.0,1665.0," No, but, um, it's just, just like race at you."
1665.0,1670.0," They, it's like, they don't even like, they don't even like, try to like, go zigzag or anything."
1670.0,1672.0," They just, be lying straight at you."
1672.0,1674.0, You throw anything in your pet and their path.
1674.0,1675.0, You're okay.
1675.0,1678.0," So I mean, it's, it's very basic so far."
1678.0,1680.0," But again, it is early on in the game."
1680.0,1681.0," Well, so again, was it Diablo?"
1681.0,1682.0, Exactly.
1682.0,1683.0, Yeah.
1683.0,1687.0," Skeletons came at you and you blew them up before they, yeah, took away all of your hit points."
1687.0,1689.0," I'm ready for Diablo three, frankly."
1689.0,1690.0, Yeah.
1690.0,1691.0, They've had long enough.
1691.0,1692.0, They need to get on that.
1692.0,1694.0, Wasn't that called Titan Quest?
1694.0,1696.0, Titan Quest is awesome.
1696.0,1697.0, That's a good point.
1697.0,1698.0," I like, Titan Quest a lot."
1698.0,1700.0," In fact, I'm ready for those guys to do."
1700.0,1701.0, Where's the more?
1701.0,1703.0, Where's Titan Quest to bring it?
1703.0,1705.0," Well, that game didn't do well here, did it?"
1705.0,1706.0, Did it?
1706.0,1709.0, Titan Quest did a lot better in Europe.
1709.0,1710.0," Yeah, that it did here."
1710.0,1713.0," So I think that that, those games are still selling really well, like, you know,"
1713.0,1714.0, sacred and all that stuff.
1714.0,1716.0," Those do a lot better in Europe, too."
1716.0,1721.0," So yeah, I'm not sure what the story is there."
1721.0,1727.0," Maybe because in Europe, you know, like, the, these games actually, I mean,"
1727.0,1730.0, this stuff really happened in Europe back in the day.
1730.0,1734.0," You know, zombies, the monsters, the toys, the toys, the toys, the toys."
1734.0,1735.0, Yeah.
1735.0,1737.0, Have you seen those old movies?
1737.0,1738.0, That didn't happen.
1738.0,1741.0," Those, you know, are you darkness took place in Europe?"
1741.0,1742.0, That's what I was saying.
1742.0,1743.0, That was for real.
1743.0,1745.0," By the time we, you know, they came over to the new world."
1745.0,1748.0, That's part of the reason they left the new world and to get it off.
1748.0,1753.0," There's kids listening to this and, you know, you spend a lot more of your time playing video games and you do"
1753.0,1754.0, paying attention in school.
1754.0,1758.0, You should pay attention to that because this is the educational part of our podcast.
1758.0,1765.0," When our forefathers came over to the new world in the early 1600s or mid 1600s,"
1765.0,1771.0," a lot of it was to get away from the, you know, the persecution from zombies and vampires,"
1771.0,1775.0," the skeletons that had poison, you know, poison gas and stuff like that."
1775.0,1777.0," And scorpions, there were lots of scorpions."
1777.0,1779.0, That undead scourge.
1779.0,1780.0," Yeah, dark chapter."
1780.0,1786.0," So really, you know, that's why you don't see that many games of that kind doing."
1786.0,1789.0," So, we should have gone in the camera."
1789.0,1790.0, I can't.
1790.0,1791.0, I can't get that.
1791.0,1792.0, I can't get that.
1792.0,1793.0," Yeah, yeah, no."
1793.0,1796.0," Man, there's, we're going to give you some concern, parents going to write it."
1796.0,1798.0, They're a cat.
1799.0,1800.0," No, Timmy, he just failed."
1800.0,1803.0, That'd be a mail you my son's report card.
1803.0,1805.0," Oh, man."
1805.0,1807.0," But, you know, actually, one of the things got me, well, I was playing hell."
1807.0,1809.0," Yeah, I got, I guess got me thinking about something else."
1809.0,1812.0, How many times do you guys play in RPG or MMOR whatever?
1812.0,1814.0, And you go up to some guy and you have a quest.
1814.0,1818.0, And you don't even bother reading the story elements of the dialogue that they go to so much trouble
1818.0,1819.0," to write and just like, oh, sure."
1819.0,1822.0, Every single time I ever had a quest in any MMOR ever.
1822.0,1823.0, Right.
1823.0,1826.0, Crusade actually changed me for some reason.
1826.0,1828.0," I don't know, he's just because I was playing well so long."
1828.0,1830.0, And I was just because I was doing it so long.
1830.0,1831.0, I was getting into it.
1831.0,1834.0, But I read everything in the Burning Crusade.
1834.0,1835.0, I do have a hard time.
1835.0,1839.0, And even the most compelling game I will even admit in Bioshock.
1839.0,1842.0," Those quite a bit of Bioshock, or I had to go back and listen to the,"
1842.0,1847.0," uh, a lot of the recordings again, because I realized I was just, yeah, yeah."
1847.0,1848.0," I was like, sort of listening."
1848.0,1851.0, And this is a world that was actually really well done.
1851.0,1855.0," But even in that game, I found it hard to focus entirely on."
1855.0,1858.0," The story and not just want to, you know,"
1858.0,1860.0," Well, usually when you're listening to stuff,"
1860.0,1863.0, there's probably something around the corner ready to kill you.
1863.0,1865.0, It's easy to like get a little distracted.
1865.0,1868.0," Well, I found myself, I, I, I so wanted to follow this,"
1868.0,1870.0," that actually the Bioshock, that's a good point."
1870.0,1872.0, Bioshock's the only game I actually did want to follow the story.
1872.0,1876.0, The only time I clicked on the recordings and stuff was when I was a hacking
1876.0,1879.0," a computer, you know, hacking as just tommor something."
1879.0,1880.0, Yeah.
1880.0,1883.0," So I have a question about how gay, which has nothing to do with its quests or story line."
1883.0,1884.0, Okay.
1884.0,1885.0, Go for it.
1885.0,1888.0," It has a random, generally randomly generated dungeon, right?"
1888.0,1889.0, Yes.
1889.0,1891.0," I mean, there are, there are main hub areas."
1891.0,1895.0," And then, you know, shooting off that, you'll have a different way to explore"
1895.0,1898.0, and different creatures populating it afterwards.
1898.0,1903.0," Okay, because that was one of my problems with, like, you know,"
1903.0,1906.0," the obel, and those kind of games, is the fact that everything's randomly generated."
1906.0,1908.0, And they're not designed.
1908.0,1910.0," To me, there's like this, this is very distinct difference."
1910.0,1913.0, You can tell when something was just randomly generated.
1913.0,1914.0," You know, well, that's a totally different way."
1914.0,1915.0," Well, that's a totally different way."
1915.0,1919.0," You're still, like, just kind of trying to fill in the map and then go upstairs."
1919.0,1921.0," Yeah, it's not the same thing."
1921.0,1925.0," But I, I did heard there were trying to do some stuff in this to make that."
1925.0,1928.0," They were trying to tweak some variables, like I know the map of the book."
1928.0,1929.0," Yeah, they were right."
1929.0,1932.0," But, I mean, they acknowledge that they don't want to have like two, like,"
1932.0,1936.0, tiles that make no sense on top of each other or like designs that come out
1936.0,1938.0, making just looking idiotic.
1938.0,1944.0," So they, they try to create this filtering system that basically logically connects areas."
1944.0,1946.0," So there's a come out, okay?"
1946.0,1949.0," I mean, granted, I'm only like level five or six."
1949.0,1950.0, Right.
1950.0,1952.0," And by the way, anyone wants to meet up with me?"
1952.0,1954.0, I am a seminar called Punky Brewster.
1954.0,1956.0, So I look for me.
1956.0,1957.0, Okay.
1957.0,1959.0," Pink hair, pig tails, can't miss me."
1959.0,1961.0, So I can real life.
1961.0,1962.0, Just say exactly.
1962.0,1965.0, I'm going to sell a moon fry your ass.
1965.0,1966.0, That's my battle crew.
1966.0,1969.0, I know officially.
1969.0,1970.0," Oh, man."
1970.0,1976.0," But yeah, it's a few levels of, you know, there are the few early dungeons I've gone through."
1976.0,1977.0, Makes sense.
1977.0,1981.0," I mean, it's not, it's not like amazing level design, but at the same point,"
1981.0,1984.0," look going through it and going, you know, we don't realize it's randomized."
1984.0,1985.0, So it doesn't look like you.
1985.0,1988.0," It doesn't look like some slipshod, like slides and tiles together."
1988.0,1993.0," Because I have played games, like, what was that ever quest based one on the PS2?"
1993.0,1994.0, Champions and all that.
1994.0,1995.0, Champions and all that.
1995.0,2000.0," Those were, like, you could tell it was just like someone hit the random legendary button."
2000.0,2003.0, So the obel is good.
2003.0,2008.0," Like, it doesn't finally not really notice that, like, right until you think about it that he had,"
2008.0,2010.0," what was, why was it, so I'm like that."
2010.0,2011.0, That doesn't make any sense.
2011.0,2012.0, Yeah.
2012.0,2013.0, Okay.
2013.0,2014.0, Just curious.
2014.0,2018.0," The thing that you saw is sort of bothered me about the obel, and the obel too."
2018.0,2022.0," And I never knew if it was my problem where the games problem was I would put the,"
2022.0,2025.0, the transparent map overlay on.
2025.0,2027.0, And then I found myself just watching that.
2027.0,2028.0," Well, right, you're playing that."
2028.0,2029.0, That's a great dungeon.
2029.0,2030.0, Right.
2030.0,2032.0, I was never looking at the dungeon itself.
2032.0,2033.0," But that way, let me think of it."
2033.0,2034.0, Yeah.
2034.0,2035.0, Yeah.
2035.0,2039.0," Like, I would switch it off because I'd like, man, I really should like be looking at the game."
2039.0,2041.0," And not just the, yeah."
2041.0,2043.0, The overlay of the game.
2043.0,2046.0," I mean, it's kind of the realization I had with, like, Supreme Commander's,"
2046.0,2048.0, and I was spending all my time and thought mode.
2048.0,2049.0, Yeah.
2049.0,2051.0," And you're like, wow, all of this power for what?"
2052.0,2058.0, I have really liked that in bio-shocked that I've not felt compelled to bring the map up that often.
2058.0,2060.0, Probably because the map is really confusing.
2060.0,2062.0," Well, the map is confusing."
2062.0,2063.0, Just like true.
2063.0,2064.0, With the arrows connecting all the stuff.
2064.0,2067.0," I mean, it makes sense to be a start by exiting there and sitting there and all together."
2067.0,2070.0, But I've had more fun just kind of exploring it.
2070.0,2073.0," There's enough landmarks that, like, I didn't really found I needed it."
2073.0,2075.0," Like, I felt I knew which direction I was going."
2075.0,2079.0," So go, yeah, I remember passing through this particular icy hallway in order to get to this thing."
2079.0,2084.0," Well, I think that I think that I would have done if I, you know, if I was working on the game that could have been kind of interesting."
2084.0,2086.0, Did you guys play the darkness at all?
2086.0,2088.0," I did, but then I stopped."
2088.0,2093.0," Okay, well, early, early, early, at any point in the game, they have these, like, it takes place in New York and they have these city maps."
2093.0,2096.0, So you actually can walk up to a map at any time.
2096.0,2098.0, And they say you were here.
2098.0,2102.0," And instead of having to call up a map and say, here's something, I think it'd be kind of cool just,"
2102.0,2105.0," it seems like every other part of that game was so, like, ingrained into the world."
2105.0,2108.0," Like, that one last bit would have been pretty cool."
2109.0,2112.0," Maybe they could just put the map in the corner where it doesn't, uh,"
2112.0,2115.0, bug you and you can come in and see it.
2115.0,2121.0," I mean, that's a convention I kind of want to, personally, it's, it's very helpful, but at the same point, it kind of distracts from the game world."
2121.0,2122.0, Pulls you out of it a little.
2122.0,2128.0," I almost rather just have it with logical places on the, you know, on a level or something."
2128.0,2129.0, That makes sense.
2129.0,2130.0, I can see apps.
2130.0,2133.0, I can see where's a logical place on the top level.
2133.0,2137.0," You're not just going to be wondering through Garland Mouse Castle, and it's going to be like, you are here."
2137.0,2140.0," Do you, did you make a Gargamel reference?"
2140.0,2143.0," Yeah, yeah, I caught that, by the way."
2143.0,2146.0, Bonus points for anyone who knows what that's about.
2146.0,2147.0," Yeah, I don't know what that's about."
2147.0,2148.0, You're talking about it.
2148.0,2149.0," Yeah, okay."
2149.0,2151.0," Yeah, Gargamel is."
2151.0,2152.0," No, oh my god."
2152.0,2154.0," Who would do you know that, is she?"
2154.0,2155.0, You really don't know what that is.
2155.0,2156.0, I don't know.
2156.0,2157.0, It's the Smurs of the Wind.
2157.0,2159.0, Oh man.
2159.0,2164.0," See, I was reading, uh, I was reading the elite in the Odyssey, why you were watching Smurf."
2164.0,2165.0," Oh, wow."
2165.0,2167.0," Yeah, yes, first."
2167.0,2170.0, Where you should put your monical in when you say that.
2170.0,2173.0, That's probably watching Spongebob actually.
2173.0,2176.0," Uh, what else do we got?"
2176.0,2180.0," We, uh, you know, I was going to print out the story, I didn't."
2180.0,2188.0," I just, I saw only know the, I don't know the details, but we had another, uh, we had another, uh, great gaming hero this week."
2188.0,2193.0," Over in China, we had once again, we had a man found dead."
2193.0,2196.0, After playing games three days in a row without leaving.
2196.0,2202.0," And you know, with all due respect to him and his family, what a fucking loser."
2202.0,2208.0," I mean, it's a hell of a, yeah, I don't know how that happens."
2208.0,2209.0," I mean, really."
2209.0,2212.0, But it happens like way too often.
2212.0,2214.0," So we're, how many times does it happen?"
2214.0,2220.0," Well, it is not, I mean, yeah, compared to the entire, you know, population of the world."
2220.0,2222.0, Maybe not in multiple times.
2222.0,2223.0, Right.
2223.0,2224.0, And it always seems to happen in China.
2224.0,2225.0, It does.
2225.0,2228.0," It has happened here though, but yeah, there's something."
2228.0,2231.0, I guess more mostly stories do come out of China.
2231.0,2238.0," I can imagine being so, so enthralled in anything that you just don't recognize your body shutting down on you."
2238.0,2239.0, That's a part.
2239.0,2242.0," That's why I'm bringing it up because we're all, we're all hardcore gamers here."
2242.0,2245.0," We all stay up, you know, two late at night playing."
2245.0,2246.0, We all have our stories.
2246.0,2249.0, So we know what it's like to be addicted to a game.
2249.0,2252.0," It really to a point where we like we sort of know better, right?"
2252.0,2257.0," Like don't you always get to a point where you're like, man, I, I social quit and I just can't."
2257.0,2264.0," And I'm going to regret it tomorrow or I should be doing, you know, 80 other things with my life tonight right now instead of this, but I can't help it."
2264.0,2265.0, That's every day for me.
2265.0,2266.0, Right.
2266.0,2267.0, So we all know that.
2267.0,2271.0," And probably everybody listening does, but how do you get to, to that point?"
2271.0,2275.0," I mean, that's the kind of thing like you have to be like, that's beyond poop shocking."
2275.0,2278.0," I mean, like, this guy didn't even like get up to go to the bathroom more."
2278.0,2279.0, Right.
2279.0,2280.0, I don't know.
2280.0,2285.0," Well, the thing with like, like, China in particular is like, like, they can't have their own world of work at the count at home right?"
2285.0,2287.0, They have to go to these gaming pubs to do it.
2287.0,2288.0, Okay.
2288.0,2295.0," So maybe like, maybe it's something associated with that where they just like, because they just can't play it anywhere."
2295.0,2301.0, So they go to these gaming pubs to get their fix and then they just don't want to leave.
2301.0,2302.0, I don't know.
2302.0,2303.0, But at the point of death.
2303.0,2305.0, Because they look like a little bit of death.
2305.0,2306.0, That's absurd.
2306.0,2311.0," But I maybe that is part of the like the psychology that's going on there because they can't just,"
2311.0,2314.0," they can't play after they leave, you know."
2314.0,2316.0, Three days.
2316.0,2317.0, Three days.
2317.0,2321.0," I mean, the other thing is like, why weren't, you know, why did this friends and family like come"
2321.0,2322.0, forcibly drag him out?
2322.0,2325.0, Because they were all playing on the computer next to him.
2325.0,2330.0," You need to come take a bath, have something to eat and get away from this freaking out."
2330.0,2334.0, This is the kind of thing you'd expect like once we're plugged into the Matrix to happen.
2335.0,2336.0, Yeah.
2336.0,2339.0, Dying of being involved in your virtual world too much.
2339.0,2341.0, But like they're just not that interesting right now.
2341.0,2344.0," Honestly, he just make me play for 72 hours straight."
2344.0,2346.0, Like after like five hours.
2346.0,2347.0," That's like, that's, yeah."
2347.0,2349.0, I've been any marathon for me.
2349.0,2350.0, Yeah.
2350.0,2351.0, I've got to go outside.
2351.0,2352.0, Oh my god.
2352.0,2355.0, I think it would be great to find out if he wasn't playing World War II.
2355.0,2357.0, I have to be playing some crap like Hobo Tellers.
2357.0,2358.0, Yeah.
2358.0,2360.0," I see, yeah, they didn't say what came to it."
2360.0,2361.0, He's playing.
2361.0,2362.0, Yeah.
2362.0,2363.0, Yeah.
2363.0,2364.0, Second life.
2364.0,2365.0, I could see.
2365.0,2366.0," Oh, god."
2366.0,2370.0," I didn't know the whole thing just, I just, I had to find a very disturbing just."
2370.0,2377.0," But on a number of levels, you know, that nobody stopped him, that he didn't stop."
2377.0,2379.0," Even the, even the store itself."
2379.0,2382.0," It's like a, it's like a dude sitting in a bar for three days."
2382.0,2383.0, I get drunk the whole time.
2383.0,2386.0," You know, at some point the bartender's going to cut you off."
2386.0,2390.0," You'd like to think that, you know, by the second day of this guy not leaving the screen that the,"
2390.0,2392.0, the head of this place would be gone.
2392.0,2394.0," Hey, fatso."
2394.0,2397.0," Well, he's probably not fat, but whatever."
2397.0,2398.0," But, you know, get the hell out."
2398.0,2399.0, Go home.
2399.0,2401.0," See your family, you know."
2401.0,2402.0, Yeah.
2402.0,2404.0, Maybe he had a bomb in his head.
2404.0,2405.0, Maybe that's it.
2405.0,2408.0, They were just misinterpreting how he died.
2408.0,2410.0, You could be right.
2410.0,2411.0, Huh?
2411.0,2412.0, Maybe that nothing to do with fact.
2412.0,2413.0, Maybe it's courtesy.
2413.0,2414.0, Maybe it's courtesy.
2414.0,2415.0, Right.
2415.0,2416.0, It was probably coinc.
2416.0,2417.0, Maybe except for the bomb.
2417.0,2418.0, He could have been going for another two weeks.
2418.0,2419.0, Let's.
2419.0,2419.5, Okay.
2419.5,2420.5, We'll go with that theory.
2420.5,2421.5, He was going to die anyway.
2421.5,2423.5, And he knew that.
2423.5,2424.5, Yeah.
2424.5,2425.5, He wanted to go out.
2425.5,2426.5, She had a fine.
2426.5,2427.5, He was going to die in three days.
2427.5,2428.5," I, yeah."
2428.5,2430.5, I'd probably hurry up to try to finish bowshot.
2430.5,2434.5," I mean, I mean, seriously, that'd be a priority list."
2434.5,2435.5, Of course.
2435.5,2436.5, Sure.
2436.5,2437.5, Yeah.
2437.5,2440.5," I might try to do a couple more things, but that definitely be on the list."
2440.5,2442.5, You got to know how it ends.
2442.5,2443.5, Yeah.
2443.5,2444.5," Oh, and Baldur's Gate 2."
2444.5,2445.5, I don't know.
2445.5,2446.5, I don't know.
2446.5,2447.5, I don't know.
2448.5,2449.5," Yeah. Oh, and Baldur's Gate 2."
2449.5,2450.5, I'd have to finish that.
2450.5,2451.5," Oh, you got to go back."
2451.5,2452.5, That's been on my hard distance.
2452.5,2453.5, I can't know.
2453.5,2454.5, I'm knowing how that ends.
2454.5,2455.5, Yeah.
2455.5,2456.5, I'm still on chapter 2 of that.
2456.5,2457.5, So.
2457.5,2458.5, Shit.
2458.5,2459.5, Man.
2459.5,2460.5, This footage.
2460.5,2463.5, We got a couple more champions to read about here.
2463.5,2464.5, We do.
2464.5,2465.5, You're taking a little break first.
2465.5,2466.5, Speaking of taking a break.
2466.5,2467.5," Okay. Well, we'll take a break."
2467.5,2469.5, And we'll come back with more champions.
2469.5,2470.5, They're not heroes of the web.
2470.5,2471.5," No, those are different."
2471.5,2473.5, Because that's Sean Elliott's domain.
2473.5,2475.5, These are champions of the web.
2475.5,2476.5, The champions of the world.
2476.5,2477.5, Yeah.
2477.5,2478.5, Okay.
2478.5,2479.5, We'll be right back.
2479.5,2481.5," Three, two, one."
2481.5,2482.5, We're the best.
2482.5,2483.5, All right.
2483.5,2490.5," Listen to EGM Live, the weekly podcast for electronic gaming monthly."
2490.5,2496.5, Available every Monday for download at EGMlive.1up.com or podcasts.
2496.5,2499.5, That one up.com or the iTunes music store.
2499.5,2500.5, Sweet the leg.
2500.5,2501.5, Sweet the leg.
2501.5,2502.5, Sweet the leg.
2502.5,2504.5, We're back.
2505.5,2507.5, And we're not back for long.
2507.5,2509.5, It's a little bit of a short podcast this week.
2509.5,2510.5, And we apologize.
2510.5,2513.5, And now it's not because Sean Elliott is not here.
2513.5,2518.5, It's because we're we're backed up here at the studio.
2518.5,2519.5, The studio B studio B.
2519.5,2524.5," We got legendary thread coming in after this, which coincidentally enough includes two of us here."
2524.5,2527.5," Actually, would be three Ryan if you weren't bailing."
2527.5,2529.5," Oh, well, but you're not quite legendary."
2529.5,2530.5, So we're going to bring up something.
2531.5,2535.5, A champion of the web that's actually probably going to get brought up in legendary thread.
2535.5,2541.5, So you can hear this time you could hear it in the other podcast or if you don't want to hear it on either one.
2541.5,2543.5, You can suck off a stop.
2543.5,2544.5, You can stop.
2544.5,2547.5, So this one up this news went up today.
2547.5,2551.5," We have a, let's see."
2551.5,2552.5, Who's the guy's name?
2552.5,2557.5," The guy's name is Shax, SH AKS."
2557.5,2573.5," He spent about 7,000 euros, which translates to about 9,700 dollars to buy a World of Warcraft rogue character."
2573.5,2575.5, That's pretty sad.
2575.5,2580.5," Okay, if that's the worst use of $10,000 had ever heard."
2580.5,2581.5, Yeah.
2581.5,2583.5," $10,000."
2583.5,2584.5, World of Warcraft.
2584.5,2585.5, For a rogue.
2585.5,2586.5, No less.
2587.5,2591.5," It says the avatar had both both legendary swords drop by raid boss,"
2591.5,2595.5, Illidan storm rage as well as four fifth of tier six armor said.
2595.5,2598.5," What would you, oh, in that case, what would you do with the."
2598.5,2602.5," I mean, like that's essentially like the end of the game."
2602.5,2603.5, For me.
2603.5,2604.5, So I guess he's just getting what you do next.
2604.5,2605.5, He's the PVP.
2605.5,2606.5, He just wants to read a game.
2606.5,2611.5," There's a great post script that I, which I got this from."
2611.5,2615.5," Gosh, did I get it from joystick or Kattaku?"
2615.5,2618.5," I can't remember my source, so I think it was just the same thing."
2618.5,2619.5, Joy-talk.
2619.5,2621.5, I got this from Joy-Talk.
2621.5,2623.5, Yeah. So thank you.
2623.5,2624.5, Joy-Talk.
2624.5,2628.5," Apparently it now according to the site, the buyer shacks,"
2628.5,2631.5, who's on the Kazak server.
2631.5,2636.5, There was a speculation that his account has been banned.
2636.5,2637.5, Nice.
2637.5,2641.5, Given the publicity of the auction in Blizzard's policy against selling accounts.
2641.5,2644.5," Well, how awesome would that be?"
2644.5,2647.5, You just dropped 10Gs on it.
2647.5,2648.5, I'll piece of crap.
2648.5,2651.5, There's the useless futile that you've having done it in the first place.
2651.5,2654.5, Then compounded by the fact that you're now banned.
2654.5,2656.5, It's horrible.
2656.5,2657.5," Ten thousand dollars, man."
2657.5,2659.5, That's a harsh lesson.
2659.5,2661.5, That guy must have a shitload of money.
2661.5,2664.5, I could not imagine dropping 10 grand on that kind of thing.
2664.5,2666.5, Holy cow.
2666.5,2667.5, There are world.
2667.5,2668.5, I could imagine.
2668.5,2669.5, I could imagine.
2669.5,2671.5," Yeah, that's what I was going to say."
2671.5,2677.5," In some extreme weird case, I can imagine maybe spending a little bit of money"
2677.5,2679.5, to buy a character.
2679.5,2680.5, I can't really.
2680.5,2681.5, I've never do it.
2681.5,2685.5," But I suppose if you could you could concox some scenario where I would go,"
2685.5,2686.5," okay, yeah."
2686.5,2688.5," For $70, I would do that."
2688.5,2689.5, I'll give you a scenario.
2689.5,2690.5, Okay.
2690.5,2692.5, You're going to raid team.
2692.5,2694.5, You're trying to do something.
2694.5,2695.5, And you need desperately.
2695.5,2697.5, You just need one more more luck.
2697.5,2698.5, Right.
2698.5,2700.5, I could level up a warlock or I could spend 70 bucks.
2700.5,2702.5, And then we could have our rating warlock and do this.
2702.5,2703.5, That might be worth it.
2703.5,2705.5, There's a scenario for you.
2705.5,2706.5, Right.
2706.5,2709.5, On the same server and then I could pass that geared along or whatever.
2709.5,2713.5," That's, or even if I couldn't, I could still be helping our guild."
2713.5,2714.5, Right.
2714.5,2715.5," But $10,000."
2715.5,2717.5, I don't even know what I would spend.
2717.5,2719.5," $10,000 on if I had it."
2719.5,2720.5, Like.
2720.5,2722.5, I don't want the warpath case.
2722.5,2724.5," Not a rogue, Jesus."
2724.5,2728.5, I kind of like one of the one of the other suggestions from that.
2728.5,2731.5," That's listed in the, in the joystick thing."
2731.5,2732.5, Yeah.
2732.5,2733.5, Or whatever.
2733.5,2734.5, Or a jotaku or whatever.
2734.5,2737.5," It's, I would go with the getting it all in pennies."
2737.5,2739.5, Putting it up pool and swim around it like Scrooge McDuck.
2739.5,2740.5, Yeah.
2740.5,2742.5, That's my personal favorite answer.
2742.5,2743.5, Yeah.
2743.5,2744.5, Yeah.
2744.5,2747.5, That's almost as bad as maybe this guy.
2747.5,2749.5, Maybe this is the guy who died.
2749.5,2750.5, Maybe that's why he's not.
2750.5,2751.5, Yeah.
2751.5,2753.5, He wasn't bandie to die.
2753.5,2754.5, Yeah.
2754.5,2755.5, Man.
2755.5,2756.5, That's what you do.
2756.5,2758.5, You do the run around and show people your swords.
2758.5,2759.5, You got from 11.
2759.5,2760.5," He's like, look at me."
2760.5,2762.5," I paid $10,000 for these."
2762.5,2765.5, I got a blindfold.
2765.5,2767.5," I, yeah."
2767.5,2769.5, I don't know what to do about that.
2769.5,2770.5," Wait, I earn your keep."
2770.5,2773.5," So who are, see, are there champion of the web Ryan?"
2773.5,2774.5, Are you going to share that?
2774.5,2776.5," Oh, we got another one."
2776.5,2777.5, What's that?
2777.5,2779.5, She might be a real champion.
2779.5,2780.5, She might be a real champion.
2780.5,2783.5, She might be a real champion.
2784.5,2785.5," You know, this is my champion."
2785.5,2786.5, This guy's a nitty.
2786.5,2787.5, Okay.
2787.5,2790.5, So this is something I got from slash dot.
2790.5,2791.5, Yeah.
2791.5,2796.5," And it says, here, a manager at a game stop has been suspended for"
2796.5,2798.5, instituting a games for grades policy.
2798.5,2800.5," Brandon Scott, no relation."
2800.5,2805.5, Says he started a union policy in his story to promote good grade in school.
2805.5,2808.5, But now his employer has sent him to detention for speaking out of turn.
2808.5,2812.5, Scott says he's been suspended by game stop in the wake of his uncomventional
2812.5,2817.5, games for grades policy and an oak cliff store apparently on his own Scott has had
2817.5,2821.5, to stop selling video games to any school age customer unless an adult would
2821.5,2822.5, vouch for the students good grades.
2822.5,2825.5, What did this dude expect of pat on the head?
2825.5,2826.5, That's right.
2826.5,2829.5, We want to sell our games to every freaking idiot in school.
2829.5,2832.5, He's doing his part to make America great again.
2832.5,2833.5, Okay.
2833.5,2838.5, It's hard to imagine this guy who thought he would not get in trouble for
2838.5,2839.5, that.
2839.5,2840.5, Yeah.
2840.5,2842.5, That's a great idea.
2842.5,2843.5, Yeah.
2843.5,2845.5, Don't sell the most of the youth.
2845.5,2846.5, Yeah.
2846.5,2848.5, Thank you for not selling our product.
2848.5,2852.5, I can imagine like it would that might work in some weird way for like you know a
2852.5,2853.5, mom and pop shop.
2853.5,2854.5," But like, yes, if it's your own store."
2854.5,2855.5, Not a corporate.
2855.5,2856.5, Yeah.
2856.5,2857.5, It's a game stop.
2857.5,2862.5," I mean, I salute the guy for trying to do something for the children's but"
2862.5,2864.5, that was a weird way to do it.
2864.5,2865.5, Yeah.
2865.5,2866.5, Yeah.
2866.5,2867.5, That's kind of what I feel.
2867.5,2869.5," I'm just like, that's very noble of you."
2869.5,2872.5, What are you surprised a little bit a little bit maybe not surprised.
2872.5,2876.5, Maybe he just like maybe he just got to the point where he's just like you know what?
2876.5,2877.5, This isn't worth it.
2877.5,2880.5, I'll sing all of these kids suffer because whatever we do what I do.
2880.5,2881.5, It's got a funny thing.
2881.5,2883.5, It's almost the exact opposite of like the hard sell they usually go through.
2883.5,2885.5, What did your suffering?
2885.5,2886.5, Huh?
2886.5,2889.5, What you just kids are suffering for what this guy is doing.
2889.5,2890.5, Whatever.
2892.5,2893.5," No, I think it's getting 80."
2893.5,2894.5, Yeah.
2894.5,2896.5, I can see why he did it you know.
2896.5,2898.5, He's got to deal with these dumbass is coming in every day.
2898.5,2900.5, He just feels responsibility for the world.
2900.5,2901.5, He's right.
2901.5,2903.5," He had a moment of clarity where he was just like,"
2903.5,2905.5, He's probably seeing what he's doing.
2905.5,2906.5, Right.
2906.5,2911.5, He's probably just to go those goddamn moms who go and drop their kids off like a daycare.
2911.5,2912.5, Yeah.
2912.5,2914.5, Once they get him to hell out of there.
2914.5,2917.5, So he's like you ain't very many possible motives for this.
2917.5,2918.5, I agree with Sean.
2918.5,2919.5, That's probably what it was.
2919.5,2921.5, He woke up one morning.
2921.5,2922.5," He was like, oh my god, what do I do?"
2922.5,2924.5," He's like, this is what I meant to do in life."
2924.5,2925.5, Yes.
2925.5,2927.5, Don't you do that here with this magazine?
2927.5,2930.5, I'm not telling you that you go home at night and call like man.
2930.5,2935.5," I'm not out there, you know, building schools for kids and to bed."
2935.5,2938.5, I'm here right in a bad video games.
2938.5,2939.5, And that's awesome.
2939.5,2941.5, Ha ha.
2941.5,2943.5, Screw those kids into bed.
2943.5,2945.5, You see where he's coming from.
2945.5,2947.5, Yeah.
2947.5,2949.5," No, not the greatest idea."
2949.5,2951.5, He should probably just in his day job.
2951.5,2954.5, Sold the shady games to the kids.
2954.5,2956.5, And then on home and then something.
2956.5,2957.5, I don't know what his motive is.
2957.5,2959.5," If his motive was to keep his job, he's an idiot."
2959.5,2960.5, If his motive.
2960.5,2964.5," If his motive was something else, then hey, cool."
2964.5,2967.5, Maybe that's just how he wanted to go out.
2967.5,2971.5," It'd be nice if like, game stop itself instituted a policy like that."
2971.5,2976.5," You know, we will not sell you Halo 3 in this."
2976.5,2978.5, You can prove that you have a 3.6.
2978.5,2979.5, That's hilarious.
2979.5,2981.5, Total total total total.
2981.5,2983.5, You're to get some hate mail for that.
2983.5,2985.5," Fuck you, Mr. Green."
2985.5,2986.5, I'm buying the game.
2986.5,2987.5, I have a 2.0.
2987.5,2989.5, What are you going to do about it?
2989.5,2990.5, Kids don't have 2.0s.
2990.5,2991.5, Do they?
2991.5,2993.5," Oh, they have letter grades."
2993.5,2998.5," If that policy is student when I was in school, I never would have played a hit here."
2998.5,2999.5, Ha ha.
2999.5,3007.5, I do consider a high GPA to be a sign that you are not qualified to work in the games industry.
3007.5,3011.5, Because that tells me you were spending way too much time being a good kid in school.
3011.5,3014.5, And not a time scoring or adding video games.
3014.5,3018.5, I feel that's a bad precedent either that or you have too much of a social life.
3018.5,3019.5," You know, you won't have that."
3019.5,3023.5, You won't have that in relation to me and I don't know if you were kidding.
3023.5,3025.5, I won't tell you my GPU.
3025.5,3027.5," I'm only, oh, you got like a 4o."
3027.5,3029.5, I know because you're so good.
3029.5,3031.5, I don't tell you.
3031.5,3033.5, Damn Apple Pollisher.
3033.5,3035.5, I had good grades up till college.
3035.5,3038.5," And then when I got the college, I realized it didn't matter anymore."
3038.5,3042.5," That's so I got really, really good at missile command."
3043.5,3044.5, I had good grades.
3044.5,3047.5, I'm going to tell like fifth grade when I move back to California.
3047.5,3050.5," Actually, I had bad grades up until college."
3050.5,3051.5," Yeah, that's an upset."
3051.5,3052.5," Oh, bad grades until college."
3052.5,3053.5, Yeah.
3053.5,3054.5, And then good grades at college.
3054.5,3055.5, Yeah.
3055.5,3056.5, Was it weird?
3056.5,3057.5, Right.
3057.5,3058.5, She started paying attention.
3058.5,3060.5," You just tell the kids that college doesn't matter, Joe."
3060.5,3061.5, Yeah.
3061.5,3062.5, Yeah.
3062.5,3063.5, Yeah.
3063.5,3064.5, All right.
3064.5,3065.5, Just checking.
3065.5,3066.5, That's right.
3066.5,3067.5," So if you want to get a job in the game industry, for get college."
3067.5,3068.5, Remember that story?
3068.5,3071.5," I told about the, you know, to get in the way from the skeletons."
3071.5,3072.5, Yeah.
3072.5,3073.5, In Europe.
3073.5,3075.5, That's why I see.
3075.5,3078.5, Education's overrated.
3078.5,3082.5, I'm just saying if you want to career in video game journals.
3082.5,3086.5," Say, you know, don't be sending me a resume with four point out."
3086.5,3088.5, Because that's that's an immediate year out.
3088.5,3090.5, I don't want to see that shit.
3090.5,3093.5, I don't see two point out and some high score screens.
3093.5,3096.5," Oh, I'm like, screenshots."
3097.5,3100.5," Oh, man."
3100.5,3103.5, I'm sending all the wrong messages today.
3103.5,3104.5, Awesome.
3104.5,3105.5, To be what else do we get?
3105.5,3106.5, That's all.
3106.5,3107.5, Let me see.
3107.5,3108.5, Let me see.
3108.5,3110.5, There's something to talk about.
3110.5,3112.5," Well, there's the, let me see the halo three high points."
3112.5,3113.5, So sick and tired of that.
3113.5,3114.5," No, we're not talking about it."
3114.5,3115.5, I think it's three.
3115.5,3116.5, Not on this podcast.
3116.5,3117.5, Yeah.
3117.5,3118.5, No sir.
3118.5,3119.5, I. Yeah. Never mind.
3119.5,3120.5, Forget that.
3120.5,3121.5, No sir.
3121.5,3122.5, Here.
3122.5,3123.5, Not on my.
3123.5,3124.5, Let's pay low three.
3124.5,3125.5, Screw it.
3125.5,3128.5, I was watching Discovery Channel last night and it's got to the point.
3128.5,3129.5," They have the, they have a."
3129.5,3131.5, Gam game promoted everywhere.
3131.5,3132.5, Yeah.
3132.5,3135.5, I mean future weapons according to Halo 3.
3135.5,3136.5, Who gives it?
3136.5,3137.5," No way, really."
3137.5,3138.5, Seriously.
3138.5,3139.5, Wow.
3139.5,3140.5, Discovery Channel did like that.
3140.5,3141.5, It's a expose.
3141.5,3142.5, That's awesome.
3142.5,3144.5," Well, that's some great marketing by Microsoft."
3144.5,3145.5, It's everywhere.
3145.5,3148.5, There's a mountain do there's slurpees.
3148.5,3149.5, There's.
3149.5,3150.5, They did have that.
3150.5,3152.5, We can be jane roped into talking about.
3152.5,3153.5," Oh, shit."
3153.5,3154.5, I'm not going to forget it.
3154.5,3155.5, Forget it. Sorry.
3155.5,3156.5," Hey, you know what it can."
3156.5,3157.5, I got nothing.
3157.5,3158.5, I've got nothing against it.
3158.5,3159.5, I'm still going to play it.
3159.5,3160.5," I'm going to play it, too."
3160.5,3163.5, And let's make that clear because there's people who listen to this podcast.
3163.5,3167.5, And we know there's a lot of people now who listen who don't play PC games at all.
3167.5,3170.5, They're console gamers and we are so we are not bagging on.
3170.5,3171.5, Yeah.
3171.5,3172.5," Well, yes."
3172.5,3173.5, We are bagging on it.
3173.5,3174.5," I'm back to the Morgan to play it, too."
3174.5,3177.5, Like I want to just bagging on like I'm tired of seeing the marketing everywhere.
3177.5,3178.5, Okay.
3178.5,3179.5, I'm going to play the game.
3179.5,3180.5, I get it.
3180.5,3181.5," Well, the hype is definitely."
3181.5,3182.5, For me.
3182.5,3186.5, Like hype to quality ratio is way off for that game.
3186.5,3187.5, But it's not what it always is.
3187.5,3189.5, The last days and just how it would be good life.
3189.5,3190.5, Yeah.
3190.5,3191.5, Mark and I have played Halo 3.
3191.5,3193.5, Maybe Halo 3 specifically is awesome.
3193.5,3196.5," But given Halo 1 and 2, really, really good games."
3196.5,3198.5, But come on.
3198.5,3199.5, Yep.
3199.5,3203.5, So apparently the ending got leaked over the internet.
3203.5,3204.5, I have heard that.
3204.5,3205.5, Master Chief dies.
3205.5,3206.5," No, I don't think."
3206.5,3207.5, I don't think.
3207.5,3208.5, I don't know.
3208.5,3209.5, Master Chief is Voldemort.
3209.5,3210.5," Actually, I got a."
3211.5,3213.5, Misses Weasley kills Master Chief.
3213.5,3215.5, I got a.
3215.5,3216.5, I got a.
3216.5,3218.5, That's my signature now.
3218.5,3225.5, A private message on Xbox Live last night from a guy who told me that the Halo 3 ending got leaked.
3225.5,3226.5, I don't know.
3226.5,3227.5, I was telling that.
3227.5,3231.5, They're going to play a smooth like Metroid and reveal the Master Chief's really a woman.
3231.5,3232.5, You think?
3232.5,3234.5, That'd be really funny.
3234.5,3236.5," Why would that be funny, Ryan?"
3236.5,3237.5, I don't know.
3238.5,3241.5, You're funny too that he hero could be a woman.
3241.5,3245.5," Well, I would say Ryan's grandmother."
3245.5,3246.5," Oh, the supermodule."
3246.5,3247.5," Oh, yeah."
3247.5,3248.5, Halo guys.
3248.5,3249.5," They'll be like, oh my god."
3249.5,3251.5, My idol was a woman this whole time.
3251.5,3253.5, I've been a woman the whole time.
3253.5,3254.5," Yeah, that's what I've to think."
3254.5,3256.5, That would be awesome.
3256.5,3259.5, I feel so confused inside.
3259.5,3260.5, That'd be awesome.
3260.5,3262.5, I'm all for that.
3262.5,3265.5," So, well, we'll be playing that."
3265.5,3266.5, I won't.
3266.5,3267.5, I'm not going to play any first.
3267.5,3268.5," Oh, yeah."
3268.5,3269.5, So I could.
3269.5,3271.5, You don't play anything.
3271.5,3272.5, You didn't even try biology.
3272.5,3274.5, I could even try it.
3274.5,3275.5, I have it at home.
3275.5,3276.5, I haven't.
3276.5,3277.5, I haven't.
3277.5,3278.5," Well, you haven't."
3278.5,3279.5, Are you half at it home?
3279.5,3280.5, That's great.
3280.5,3281.5," Oh, that's just the end."
3281.5,3283.5," The is it out of the shrink wrap, even?"
3283.5,3284.5, Right.
3284.5,3287.5, You got to have a sealed box home.
3287.5,3288.5, Wow.
3288.5,3290.5, It's a first step.
3290.5,3292.5, It's a slow migration.
3292.5,3295.5, I should have been in the same way.
3295.5,3296.5, Yeah.
3296.5,3298.5," Yes, I bought Warren piece."
3298.5,3299.5, I read the dust jar.
3299.5,3301.5, I read a lot of them.
3301.5,3304.5, I have Bartleby.
3304.5,3308.5, I read the cliff notes and I read the lighter notes on it.
3308.5,3310.5, I started playing gradius five last night.
3310.5,3312.5, That was pretty cool.
3312.5,3313.5, What?
3313.5,3314.5, What?
3314.5,3317.5," Yeah, you said don't play."
3317.5,3318.5, That's what you said.
3318.5,3319.5, I played gradius five.
3319.5,3320.5, That is a classic shooter.
3320.5,3321.5," Yeah, it is."
