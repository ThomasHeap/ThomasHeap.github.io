0.0,4.0, This one up podcast is brought to you by Windows Media Center.
4.0,11.0," Your Xbox 360, your music, your photos, your TV shows and your videos with one connection."
21.0,24.0," Alright, the weight is over, we're coming to you live,"
24.0,30.0, live by tape from Santa Monica to give you a rundown of the first day of E3s in the books.
30.0,33.0, We're going to hit the press conference as hard here in the first segment.
33.0,35.0, We'll probably catch them also in the second segment.
35.0,37.0," So if you're looking forward to specific games,"
37.0,39.0," we may catch a few highlights at the end of the second segment today,"
39.0,43.0, but we'll be hitting those much harder in the next two days after this.
43.0,46.0, We can't go any further without introducing the cast here in the room with me.
46.0,52.0," I have John and Shane, and then also joining us today are Patrick and Sean Elliott."
52.0,55.0, So we got a whole crew to rotate in and out.
55.0,60.0, Let's get right into Microsoft because that was a weird press conference last night.
60.0,61.0, It wasn't.
61.0,63.0," It was outdoors, which is very strange."
63.0,64.0, You've never had that happen before.
64.0,67.0, In a high school auditorium.
67.0,71.0," Yeah, you've had the high school that taught a toying looks like it's marine or older or something."
71.0,73.0," Yeah, apparently I wondered what the deal with."
73.0,75.0, They had like a water feature on the tape.
75.0,76.0, They built that.
76.0,77.0," No, no."
77.0,78.0, The water feature was there.
78.0,80.0, They just put stuff around it.
81.0,83.0, State state synchronized swimming championships.
83.0,87.0," There's a hole and they put stuff over the pool and sort of sculpted it around it,"
87.0,89.0, but the pool was there already.
89.0,93.0," Well, as anybody was watching the press conference on the net or on TV knows,"
93.0,98.0," they started it in kind of, I think, a vaguely lame way with this bad thing."
98.0,100.0, Really vague about it.
100.0,104.0," Yeah, this band made up of five super Halo fans from Indiana or something."
104.0,106.0, What do you call that band?
106.0,108.0, They believe they were called a.
108.0,109.0, They're called.
109.0,112.0," Yeah, because I call them corporeal speedwagon."
112.0,117.0," If you put it down there and stuff anyway, they played a very spirited cover of the Halo title screen theme."
117.0,118.0, They were so hard.
118.0,122.0," They were trying, they were very, I mean, and when we say that it was lame,"
122.0,124.0, not that they themselves were lame.
124.0,128.0," It was just, it just wasn't really the inappropriate way to start the press conference."
128.0,129.0, Right.
129.0,131.0," They were like very, very comfortable."
131.0,132.0," Yeah, they tried to, they were very, very into it."
132.0,135.0," I got to admire the chick with their electric violin walking out over the,"
135.0,139.0," over the catwalk thing doing the sort of like, you know, the rock stuff thing."
139.0,143.0, But definitely didn't evoke the emotion that I think Microsoft may have hoped.
143.0,147.0," What did vote for me was like the, like, who wants to be a star?"
147.0,150.0," You know, those shows like, you know, David Hasselhoff, whatever."
150.0,151.0," Like, Eric has got talent."
151.0,152.0," Eric has got talent in question, Mark."
152.0,153.0, So you're Apollo.
153.0,156.0," But when I watched those, I want to see people fail in like, like,"
156.0,160.0," but so I was hoping that they were going to lower down because at first I was like,"
160.0,162.0," maybe it would be rafting lower down a styrofoam stone hinge,"
162.0,166.0," but a master chief would have been all red, but if they were like some irony to it,"
166.0,170.0," and it was all like tilted, but then if it like knocked her over and she fell into the water."
170.0,173.0," So what have been, unfortunately, corporeal did not fail,"
173.0,178.0," but if you were a fan of failure, luckily the next act, which was Peter Moore and the creators of rock band"
178.0,183.0," can be out in playing rock band, there was tons of failure because Peter Moore died in the game,"
183.0,184.0, even though he was uneasy.
184.0,185.0, You're right.
185.0,188.0, And he kept actually pausing the game completely blacking out.
189.0,193.0," And when he hit the pause, then the men you came up in the options were, you know,"
193.0,198.0," resume options are like, start, and he got so close to hitting restart and you could tell they were like,"
198.0,200.0," don't do it, don't do it, dude."
200.0,201.0," Oh, he was trying to do lefty switch."
201.0,203.0," Yeah, the lefty switch thing."
203.0,204.0, Yeah.
204.0,208.0," When you follow up when you have four high school kids playing real instruments and doing this,"
208.0,211.0," then you followed up with a bunch of adults and a Fisher Price, like,"
211.0,212.0, jamboreeset.
212.0,215.0," That already is like a weird way to kind of transition from,"
216.0,219.0," yeah, so 10 minutes in, it was kind of running on fumes."
219.0,220.0, It could only go up from there.
220.0,225.0," But far from went up, oh, come on, do you know, when it went down significantly?"
225.0,228.0," Well, look, there were some good things like mass effect, for example."
228.0,233.0," Okay, okay, but you said it could only go up from there and like the ultimate segue from that is to talk about,"
233.0,236.0," what, what, you know, I don't even remember his name."
236.0,238.0, What the hell is he talking about?
238.0,239.0, Oh my god.
239.0,242.0," Jennifer, who is some kind of corporate,"
242.0,244.0, they're all sort of vice president.
244.0,246.0," He was trying to say, I'm just trying to guess."
246.0,250.0," I really, time sure, because I was thinking he probably had, like, a used car lot."
250.0,252.0, Either that or he's like a televangeless.
252.0,254.0," He was, he was too slow for you."
254.0,255.0, That was sort of smug.
255.0,260.0," Great when he was saying things like, we have done over 125 million dollars on eggs bugs."
260.0,262.0," Like before, after that."
262.0,264.0, I love gold next.
264.0,265.0," Yeah, whatever."
265.0,267.0," He basically, he, he, he, he,"
267.0,269.0, gold and that expands in the house.
269.0,271.0, He sounded like somebody who had way too much media training.
271.0,272.0," Yeah, it's like a slicster."
272.0,273.0," Like, he was trying to sell you something."
273.0,274.0," Yeah, it just came off as genuine."
274.0,275.0," It didn't, it really didn't help it."
275.0,276.0, It didn't help it.
276.0,277.0, It didn't.
277.0,280.0," It actually, I mean, some people complain that they think that the Peter Moore is, you know,"
280.0,285.0," too much of a spokesperson, but I mean, compared to anyone that has any kind of issues with Peter,"
285.0,289.0," which I think, that's somewhat justified, because I think he's fairly genuine."
289.0,293.0," I mean, he did come up through marketing, but he really believes in, in what he's doing."
293.0,294.0, Right.
294.0,299.0," But he looked like the most genuine, like hardcore guy imaginable next to this guy on the floor."
299.0,300.0, Did I sort of like Peter's approach?
300.0,303.0," I mean, actually, like, it is this, like, really brought that into focus."
303.0,307.0," Watchin' this guy up there, like, I agree on it."
307.0,308.0, It was a pulse me.
308.0,309.0, Yeah.
309.0,311.0," I'm like, I'm like, wow, you know what, actually, that kind of like Peter."
311.0,315.0," It's like, he's like, this cool guy who actually does really believe in it and has a, you know,"
315.0,316.0, the pizza-side it about it.
316.0,317.0, I've had that heads in that.
317.0,320.0," You could say you watching around, though, a people are not just journalists, though,"
320.0,326.0," executives from publishers, and they just had that heads in that hand while the guy was talking."
326.0,327.0, The whole time.
327.0,331.0," So that thing I think is, you know, an American beauty, the other real estate agent, the wife"
331.0,332.0, hooks up with.
332.0,333.0, Yeah.
333.0,334.0, It was kind of like that.
334.0,337.0," So the guy might be really good at what he does, but it was just a total misfit."
337.0,341.0," Because you take someone who, like we say, really good, get you to buy some time shares,"
341.0,345.0," you know, in a corner or something, but then you put him in front of like the dirtiest, you know,"
345.0,348.0," dirt bag slime buckets, you know, us or me."
348.0,351.0," And then we're like, you know, we're so hard to please."
351.0,353.0, We're going to be critical of everything.
353.0,354.0, We're just there to laugh.
354.0,359.0," And we're just like, filthy scavengers there to take the, the foam ass pads and put them on eBay when they're done."
359.0,362.0, And then like that guy is supposed to sit over well with them.
362.0,363.0," Wait, I should have saved that."
363.0,364.0, Those are on eBay.
364.0,365.0, Yeah.
365.0,366.0," Of course, I do."
366.0,367.0, I do.
367.0,368.0, People don't know what we're talking about.
368.0,371.0," And because it was in a high school auditorium, it was just like concrete step to a saddle."
371.0,377.0," A Microsoft done these custom made foam pads that had handles that had the, that kind of,"
377.0,380.0, the J. Allid era Microsoft.
380.0,385.0," Because that trick for concentric circles and scrolly writing and like, and I'm sorry, guy,"
385.0,386.0, what kind of we'd like to 12 of them.
386.0,389.0," Those guy, I wanted a stage like, you know, there's the catch predator."
389.0,391.0, I wanted like to catch a scavenger.
391.0,394.0," Well, I told Jeff, I'm like, do you have a fucking camera, give me your camera,"
394.0,395.0, because we had some of our feet.
395.0,399.0," And I wanted to take a picture of anyone that didn't be like, excuse me, sir."
399.0,403.0," You know, we have your Xbox live record and it shows you never leave your house."
403.0,407.0," You know, because like, you're not going to, you're not going to, you're not going to fish in to put on the board of your robot."
407.0,410.0, You're not going to the ball game to like smooth your ass out there.
410.0,414.0," The fat guy in front of me about halfway through, he took an extra one because he wasn't enough padding."
414.0,415.0, He saw that.
415.0,416.0, He did a double.
416.0,417.0, He did a double.
417.0,418.0, He doubling them up.
418.0,419.0, Or is it one for you?
419.0,420.0, He doubled them up.
420.0,421.0, Yeah.
421.0,423.0," Oh, but you know, it was a post."
423.0,425.0, This post conference wasn't about cushions.
425.0,428.0," It was about games and like I, I feel they really played it too safe."
428.0,430.0, They decided to focus on this year's lineup.
430.0,433.0," And that's a smart decision in a way, but we already know about those games."
433.0,436.0," And when the other two competitors aren't just focusing on this year,"
436.0,439.0, it makes them seem like they don't have things.
439.0,441.0, I have a theory on why they did it that way.
441.0,445.0," And I think a lot of it was to do with the fact that the, the, the reach that they had with this press conference."
445.0,447.0, It was live on G4.
447.0,449.0," There was, there were a lot of people streaming it."
449.0,450.0, It was very much.
450.0,453.0, It felt like it was constructed around being a television event.
453.0,455.0, It was almost like an infomercial in a way.
455.0,460.0," And it was all about this is if you buy an Xbox 360 now or if you have an Xbox 360 now,"
460.0,463.0, this is what you're going to be able to go out and buy over the next three months.
463.0,466.0," And the only way, the only place where they broke that was Resident Evil."
466.0,467.0, And didn't we talk about this?
467.0,473.0," I mean, in this about where we presumed what happened, like they would show almost everything dedicated to dominating this holiday."
473.0,476.0," But I thought at the end they would like, you know, break away and show a few things."
476.0,479.0," And like about halfway through they're like, oh, here's a big list of games."
479.0,483.0," Alan Wake, two human, fabled to, um, what was the fourth game?"
483.0,484.0, Or something really good.
484.0,486.0, Another first party game that we're excited about.
486.0,487.0," Oh, Banger 3."
487.0,489.0," And they're like, those games will not be shown today."
489.0,491.0," Like, these games you really want to see."
491.0,493.0, Alan Wake is the game we've talked about many times you want to see.
493.0,496.0," Like, just show us a small clip is really that difficult to show us a small clip."
496.0,498.0, Is it that difficult to announce something?
498.0,501.0," The only games that were announced yesterday, well, two days ago, we're, uh,"
501.0,505.0," uh, we've been, we've been yada party animals, which we talked about it."
505.0,506.0," Yep, humanity."
506.0,507.0, It looks good.
507.0,508.0, It's by Chrome the guys you may tie.
508.0,510.0, I think I think it looks good.
510.0,515.0," You know, it's very cutesy and we'll see if it's, say any game has like, belching."
515.0,518.0," I mean, that wasn't burping that was full on belching to move things."
518.0,519.0, That's good.
519.0,520.0, Yeah.
520.0,521.0, So it looks good.
521.0,525.0," I know when we've seen it, which is this, uh, movie trivia DVD game, which is very popular."
525.0,530.24," It is, but it's a complete rip off of buzz, which is a PS2 party game that's coming"
530.24,532.24, over from Europe that's been successful for many years.
532.24,533.24," Like, almost exactly."
533.24,534.24, Yeah.
534.24,537.24," The controller that it comes packed with, it's like, it's like a buzzer for, you know, a game."
537.24,538.24, It's a play button.
538.24,539.24, It has a full-face button.
539.24,541.24, The board game rip off this other game.
541.24,543.24, Because seen it's like a board game.
543.24,544.24, That was the thing.
544.24,546.24, Does the scene in board game have that same controller?
546.24,547.24, No.
547.24,550.0," But see, name board game is like a DVD game."
550.0,552.0," So yeah, I'm pretty sure this, so you just use your remote."
552.0,553.48, I'm pretty sure this is copying buzz.
553.48,555.28," I mean, maybe you're on, but I'm pretty sure this."
555.28,556.28, Right.
556.28,558.96," But like, would it kill them to announce one or two more games really?"
558.96,561.6800000000001," Well, they had gears at war, but someone fucked that up."
561.6800000000001,562.6800000000001, Who would that?
562.6800000000001,563.6800000000001, It was the end of the game.
563.6800000000001,564.6800000000001," Oh, I was supposed to be in a new game."
564.6800000000001,565.6800000000001, You're skipping head to PC.
565.6800000000001,566.6800000000001, I'm talking just 360 right now.
566.6800000000001,567.6800000000001," And like, well, I did it."
567.6800000000001,572.32, I didn't enjoy my moment in the sun there when Resident Evil 5 video that you told me
572.32,573.32, wasn't going to be there.
573.32,574.32, What?
574.32,575.32, What up on the screen?
575.32,576.32, How come I guarantee that it wasn't going to be there?
576.32,578.9200000000001, I'm happy to see it because it's a really cool trailer and like it's awesome.
578.9200000000001,581.6800000000001," So, so I'm sure the different recud of it today at their press conference."
581.6800000000001,584.7600000000001, And I guess the full version is coming online in about two weeks.
584.7600000000001,585.7600000000001, I'm very looking forward to it.
585.7600000000001,590.24," You know, you can't even be like, that is the, that is, they get creepier every time"
590.24,591.24, somehow.
591.24,592.24," That was, yeah."
592.24,594.08, There was something unsettling about that though.
594.08,596.4000000000001," I mean, because it was like Resident Evil Hotel Rwanda."
596.4000000000001,597.4000000000001," Well, yeah."
597.4000000000001,598.4000000000001," Oh, yeah."
598.4000000000001,602.6400000000001," Because, you know, if this was the first game in a series, it wouldn't be so bad to have"
602.6400000000001,605.5200000000001, a bunch of like zombies starving Africans come out for you.
605.52,609.8," But it's like, of course, they've established that like, okay, they've been American,"
609.8,614.16," you know, white American and Japanese and Latino characters and everyone else is like,"
614.16,616.4399999999999, they all just become these flesh hungry monsters.
616.4399999999999,620.8, But it was weird to see that representation of a bunch of Africans coming at the character.
620.8,622.6," It was like, part of me was like, this is weird."
622.6,627.16," It was like, how many people are they playing into like a fear of black people?"
627.16,630.12," You know, like, I don't think people brought that up."
630.12,631.12," I mean, I'm not saying this thing."
631.12,634.16," I thought of like, no people are not just, they're not, but it's there though."
634.16,637.56," I think it's just, we're so conditioned to like be aware of the realities of our world."
637.56,641.16," That, you know, it was, it's like, they, I think what they did was they looked at like,"
641.16,648.4399999999999," wow, setting this in a remote third world country, which we're just assuming is Africa."
648.4399999999999,652.56," But it definitely probably is like some part of Africa is just, it's so remote, it's so"
652.56,654.36, removed from like help.
654.36,657.48, So you can definitely feel completely isolated and stranded there.
657.48,659.04, Very foreign setting.
659.04,662.24," Brian has a theory since the zombies running this one and like, who are better runners and"
662.24,664.24," like, you know, like, keep that."
664.24,666.24," Oh, dude."
666.24,668.24," The marathon just, all right?"
668.24,670.24," John, they're signs of an evil Kenya."
670.24,672.24," They're a scientific, Bob."
672.24,674.24," Anyway, good, it looked awesome."
674.24,678.24," It looked awesome and the sickle, the sickles that that guy was holding."
678.24,679.24," Oh my god, those look."
679.24,683.24," Well, so I think the big winner gets a besides R.E.5 at Microsoft was Call of Duty 4."
683.24,685.24, They should have really cool level.
685.24,686.24, Yeah.
686.24,687.24, And like a lot of it.
687.24,689.24," And then people are like, well, should they really show that before they show Halo 3?"
689.24,690.24, I don't know.
690.24,696.24," They should know, especially when the animation was so good, the character movement is so fluid and convincingly life like."
696.24,700.24," And when they show Halo 3, and after they just got done showing Spider-Man, friend or foe,"
700.24,704.24," and when they got there, the alien picks up the human and it halo trailer and throws them."
704.24,709.24," And it looked like the cheesiest like licensed movie animation, like, no weight whatsoever to it."
709.24,711.24," Just really, that Halo trailer they showed."
711.24,712.24, Really bad.
712.24,713.24, Which one?
713.24,714.24, The Weddle live action?
714.24,716.24," No, no, the trailer at the trailer for Halo."
716.24,717.24, You don't like it.
717.24,719.24, I don't think it did the game justice because about
719.24,724.24," an hour after the press conference, I went and saw Halo single player playing."
724.24,727.24, And it really is very impressive looking.
727.24,731.24," But the way that trailer was cut, you weren't able to fully see."
731.24,732.24, There's a lot of subtlety to it.
732.24,735.24," It's not as beat you over the head with how good looking it is, the way it gives of war is."
735.24,739.24, There's a lot of subtlety to the way that it's using particles and dust and things in the environment.
739.24,741.24, And the way the lighting is.
741.24,748.24," Because they showed it later on, they showed us there was a fight where it was even a bunch of Marines fighting with the arbiter through a jungle."
748.24,750.24, And then eventually getting to.
750.24,756.24, There's like this dock by a river and there's a pelican that there's a fire fight between a pelican and a bunch of the Covenant and it crashes.
756.24,758.24, And it's like a big set piece.
758.24,762.24, But the stuff where the light is coming through the trees and the way that the lighting changes and everything is.
762.24,767.24, Is lit and everything is shadowed and there's like dust and stuff flying in the air and it look gorgeous.
767.24,769.24," But it was pretty, it was quick cuts."
769.24,770.24, You couldn't try.
770.24,772.24, You need to be able to absorb or the subtlety on the environment.
772.24,773.24, It's that kind of.
773.24,778.24, That kind of high death as opposed to the really obvious like crazy textures and like right by contrast.
778.24,780.24, It was the cut way too quick.
780.24,785.24," Yeah, that's that was the first station for me is that I know everybody who came back from getting a chance to play Halo 3,"
785.24,793.24, which was which was pretty small group was really thrilled by how much better the single player game looked than the multiplayer beta had looked.
793.24,799.24," Well we'd so we also saw um, soundtrack which um, is like a sort of desert multiplayer thing."
799.24,802.24, And it's not I mean people have been like all the single player looks better than multiplayer.
802.24,806.24, They've they've upgraded the graphics definitely since the beta.
806.24,813.24, And this one soundtrack is this this this is a huge arena is out in the desert and there's these ruins and there's like wind kicking through the environment the whole time.
813.24,816.24, So the the sand in the air the whole time as well.
816.24,821.24, So it gives it a really kind of gritty sort of like much more movie like feel to it.
821.24,823.24, So why did they cut that that trailer like that?
823.24,827.24," Because if that's the only thing that they're going to have out in front of the larger audience,"
827.24,829.24, even the larger audience of journalists that are here.
829.24,830.24," Oh, but why did they cut that so fast?"
830.24,831.24, We're supposed to the release.
831.24,832.24, I mean we're going to see more cameras.
832.24,833.24, We're going to see more media.
833.24,834.24, It's not like this.
834.24,835.24, Most of the reason or not.
835.24,836.24, A lot of people wanted to see a lot of people.
836.24,840.24, I think I think what really happened was they rushed the rest of that trailer because it's so close to the end.
840.24,845.24, And they didn't have the time to pour over it and to sink it to the music the way they normally do.
845.24,847.24," And what they should have done rather than I mean,"
847.24,850.24," I mean, it takes a long time to cut a trailer like that and to get the footage that they need."
850.24,852.24," Well, they should have done it's been a couple of minutes."
852.24,854.24, I just played the damn thing in front of everybody.
854.24,856.24, And that's absolutely that would have been fantastic.
856.24,859.24," Well, what about the live action video they showed?"
859.24,862.24," I thought it was impressive, but ultimately kind of more close."
862.24,864.24, I don't understand why they did it.
864.24,865.24," I mean, it's cool."
865.24,869.24, All it's the world is underscore like how derivative all the design is from aliens.
869.24,874.24," When you see it live action, no, when you see those suits on on what look like human people."
874.24,877.24," And when you see the pelican and stuff, you're like,"
877.24,883.24," wow, they really did rip 100% of all these drop ships, all these armors all definitely from that movie."
883.24,886.24," Oh, that's depressing."
886.24,889.24," I just had to point out, I was making fun of it."
889.24,893.24," It's like, I was like, he man, but a couple of the new characters they showed were so bright."
893.24,897.24, All I remember in my head is like a patch of red and blue and green or whatever.
897.24,901.24," And it was like, they look pretty silly to me, especially after the follow up from like,"
901.24,905.24," you know, call duty, which was super saturated and just like,"
905.24,908.24," Now, actually, to the speaking of quality and because I saw,"
908.24,910.24, I saw another trailer that was a lot more colorful.
910.24,915.24," Now, is the demo that they showed with the one that was set 15 years ago."
915.24,918.24, Is it all bleached out like that because it's in the past?
918.24,920.24, Is that is that kind of a visual?
920.24,923.24," Because it's a depressing, like, show it to nobles."
923.24,927.24," I think it was, yeah, it was an aesthetic call for the channel."
927.24,930.24," It got environment because it was a very, very colorful palette."
930.24,931.24, But effective.
931.24,934.24," Well, it was a sniper thing and camouflage was everything."
934.24,937.24," And so what better way to get the effect on the guy rises up and just gilly suit and you're like,"
937.24,939.24," whoa, I didn't even notice that that was right."
939.24,943.24," I say, I know I wasn't the only person who when that guy rose up out of the weeds and his guillotine."
943.24,945.24," So you were like, holy crap, that guy was standing there."
945.24,947.24," And he was talking to the producer today and he said, you know,"
947.24,952.24, we've actually played around with that before and turned that guy's cue off and walked around him.
952.24,958.24," And it's amazing, like, how, how fully camouflaged he is."
958.24,961.24," And you really can't see him, even though he is really there in the grass."
961.24,962.24, And it's not fake at all.
962.24,965.24," The guy said, that level also didn't seem quite as pedestrian and predictable."
965.24,968.24," Like at the end, the other crawling towards his huge number of tree wells."
968.24,969.24, What's going to happen?
969.24,970.24, Here's triggered a trap.
970.24,971.24, You should get a trap.
971.24,974.24," No, just because again, you know, I touched on it in the last week's show."
974.24,978.24," But where I think that people are like, and I'm super happy that they are drawn to it."
978.24,980.24, Normally don't care about combat games.
980.24,982.24, But art noticing what I'm noticing.
982.24,988.24," So for example, traditionally in the Call of Duty series, what they'll do is they'll have a really linear layout and a snaking path that you follow."
988.24,993.24, And they'll keep you on it rather than having or erecting arbitrary walls or visibly arbitrary walls.
993.24,996.24," They'll say, here's a mine field and we're going to throw these warning signs."
996.24,1005.24," What they did this time, if you noticed, you'll see a ver, you can see the contours of the path and they were with radiation warning signs, which was especially kind of weird because of course radiation doesn't work that way."
1005.24,1008.24," You know, we don't put your tie-dairy to put your foot over that line."
1008.24,1012.24," You know, and you can see that and I could still very much see that this is like I was saying."
1012.24,1014.24," This is a call of duty to get, you know."
1014.24,1017.24," But at the same time, I'm completely impressed by it too."
1017.24,1023.24," But I think when people do play it, they will see, okay, there's a lot of stuff that it's pretty familiar."
1023.24,1026.24," Well, I saw two more aspects of it today."
1026.24,1029.24," For one thing at the Activision Press Comments, they should have another trailer."
1029.24,1031.24, And this was called Charlie Don't Surf.
1031.24,1032.24, And it was crazy.
1032.24,1038.24, It was exactly like that scene in Apocalypse Now with a air cab assault on a coastal town.
1038.24,1041.24, It looked very much like it was probably somewhere in the middle east.
1041.24,1046.24," The helicopters came through, you know, came over the ocean really low, came across the beach and into the town."
1046.24,1050.24," There was RPG rocket fire, you know, coming up through the helicopters."
1050.24,1053.24," They, they buy, you know, they went deeper into the town."
1053.24,1055.24, It was like some sort of strike mission.
1055.24,1060.24," And then when they get to wherever their landing zone is going to be, they cleared out the area with a couple of gunships."
1060.24,1064.24," They, they repelled down into the city and then started in the salt."
1064.24,1068.24," And they went through the rest of the salt and whatever building, I guess everything like a communication center."
1068.24,1070.24, That was really impressive.
1070.24,1073.24," And then they're showing it, they're demoing it being played."
1073.24,1077.24," I mean, unfortunately, apparently they have, they have some other obligations."
1077.24,1081.24, So they're not allowing hands on right now for anybody in the press to play.
1081.24,1083.24, But they're playing in front of us.
1083.24,1088.24," Like, and it is so dialed in the level that I saw was, was working through an urban area."
1088.24,1093.24," And, and it's just, it's just amazing how much is going to be seen it all before?"
1093.24,1094.24," Or, no, it's not."
1094.24,1095.24," No, it wasn't seen night scene before."
1095.24,1097.24," It was going through a, a, a sheldout area."
1097.24,1104.24," You had to outflank some, some positions that were in a building where the guys were keeping you pinned down."
1104.24,1108.24, And you switched into your night vision for a while because you were inside a bomb out building.
1108.24,1109.24, It was dark.
1109.24,1112.24," And then, you know, you're going outside a starlight had come out of night vision."
1112.24,1122.24," What impressed me the most about it is, is much like you had in, in Call of Duty 2 is just the amount of actual action that's going on while you're there in the battlefield."
1122.24,1124.24," So it's just, it's really, really dynamic."
1124.24,1125.24, There's a ton going on.
1125.24,1126.24, We're talking about the engine.
1126.24,1129.24, The engine is so fricking gorgeous.
1129.24,1132.24," But there's a lot of talk about which versions, because all three versions are being shown here."
1132.24,1133.24, PCP 3N 360.
1133.24,1134.24, This was 360 I was looking at.
1134.24,1136.24, This shows the 360 primarily.
1136.24,1138.24, And so you know what's going to look at across all.
1138.24,1140.24, So I started grilling him a little bit.
1140.24,1141.24, I started grilling the producer a little bit on the game.
1141.24,1143.24, And we wanted the things I pointed out to him.
1143.24,1144.24," I said, it was amazing."
1144.24,1145.24," Like, you know, how much stuff you have."
1145.24,1146.24," I mean, lights you have in here."
1146.24,1148.24," I mean, how much of this stuff is faked in the background."
1148.24,1156.24," And like, what he said is that everything in the game is done in engine and not faked in and not drawn in the background."
1156.24,1159.24," So like, even when you're standing there, so like you're standing there in this parking lot."
1159.24,1160.24, And there's like a bridge.
1161.24,1164.24," You know, a quarter mile away that has street lamps on it."
1164.24,1169.24, And everyone on the street lamps is actually a real light source casting shadows with the full full effects system on it.
1169.24,1170.24, Everything.
1170.24,1172.24, They're not using skyboxes or anything like that.
1172.24,1175.24," But the thing is is like, you were saying how dynamic all those moments are."
1175.24,1177.24," And to me, that's just describing like a perfectly scripted moment."
1177.24,1182.24," And it's all from like the EA Medal of Honor school where, you know, when we play various EA games and like,"
1182.24,1185.24," of certain, you know, Mustang flies in drops of bombs on a panzer or something."
1185.24,1187.24, The bridge blows up and you go on.
1187.24,1188.24, And that's stuff's really cool.
1188.24,1193.24," But it's interesting because we're now we moved in the split where, you know, you have to talk about crisis later, but you have crisis on the other end."
1193.24,1197.24," Right. And then the battlefield type experience where instead when something crazy happens, you're like,"
1197.24,1202.24," Okay, I put a tranquilizer on a guy, he got in the chop where I let him get up and then I put him a sleep and watch the chopper go down."
1202.24,1206.24," And here you're like, you know, here comes the armada of cobras, they're ripping through the city and stuff."
1206.24,1213.24," But the thing is is when you play that again, you're going to notice that those cobras are going to come in to the right of awkward planning your head and the exact same fashion."
1213.24,1215.24, And that that's very much a show that's being put on for you.
1215.24,1219.24," I wasn't talking about anything like, you know, over the top dramatic happening."
1219.24,1227.24," I was just talking about the amount of firefight that was going on around you between your troops who are pinned down and you know, trying to maintain cover and the guys who are firing on them."
1227.24,1229.24, There's just a lot going on.
1229.24,1231.24, So do you think this has a chance to be game in the show?
1231.24,1233.24," I mean, people have been saying that, but from where do you go?"
1233.24,1235.24, I think it definitely has a chance to be game in the show.
1235.24,1241.24, And here's the other point because we've talked about this a lot on the show is how much trouble developers have had with PS3 development.
1241.24,1248.24, And this is just to show you how good and how a good engine team can overcome problems that others can't overcome.
1248.24,1253.24," I asked them, you know, if they'd had you trouble because they're showing it so much on 360 and PC or how's PS3 version coming."
1253.24,1254.24," They're like, oh, it's fine."
1254.24,1257.24," And I said, well, so it's fine and running at, you know, 30 frames."
1257.24,1264.24," And the producer flat out, like, looked at me like, I was a jackass and was like, no, anything less than 60 frames is totally unacceptable."
1264.24,1269.24," I'm like, so how'd you handle the port coming over from 360's like,"
1270.24,1272.24, we programmed it.
1272.24,1273.24, We totally awesome.
1273.24,1275.24," We mean, it wasn't mean to dig about it."
1275.24,1278.24," He was just being like, well, we just, you know, that's what we do."
1278.24,1280.24, We had to make it work. So we did it.
1280.24,1281.24, That's an absolute idea.
1281.24,1282.24," Yeah, we took a lot of equity."
1282.24,1284.24, We were going to talk about the press conferences.
1284.24,1293.24," So it let's, I mean, there was a long, well, something indicative of the way that I think they dropped the ball was with Assassin's Creed."
1293.24,1294.24," Yeah, yeah."
1294.24,1299.24," But what happened again there is that you're like, this isn't a showing for just a few journalists."
1299.24,1304.24," This was the world stage, like you're saying everyone was watching us televised and it was a little cutie jade Raymond."
1304.24,1311.24," And she was, and they had her, but they had essentially what was, what was a segment of the game that they were working on and just making perfect to go on stage."
1311.24,1314.24, And then what happened was all kinds of technical errors and stuff.
1314.24,1317.24," Of course, it started off the guys on like a mid-ret diving board."
1317.24,1322.24, And she's like about to tell you how realistic environmental action action is.
1322.24,1326.24," And he like does a great gainus into a hay basket and everyone she's like, oh yeah."
1326.24,1330.24," And then next move, there's like a set of feet of women with pots on their heads walking by."
1330.24,1336.24," And then while remaining five feet away, he's somehow bumping into them and then the pots fall off and vanish before they hit the ground."
1336.24,1343.24, That part right there was my estimation of this game dropped a full notch right there during that segment because he's not even near them.
1343.24,1346.24," He's like he's justoring like he's hitting them, but he's three feet away."
1346.24,1347.24, Yeah.
1347.24,1349.24," They're justoring like they're being hit, but they're three feet away."
1349.24,1350.24, It's a contact in problem.
1350.24,1352.24, They were other big problems.
1352.24,1360.24," Like when you're walking through these crowded city streets, whatever person who you're focused on, there's this really strange like techno filter on them."
1360.24,1363.24," They're glowing and there's like, we're walking around the gym again."
1363.24,1365.24, And it takes you out of the gate.
1365.24,1369.24," And Brian and I were talking about that when we were walking back there, like, telling that down."
1369.24,1373.24," And they've got to have a clean, you know, the time it comes to come clean about the whole story."
1373.24,1378.24," You know, whatever it is, stop pussyfooting around it, answer the questions or at least lay out something because otherwise."
1378.24,1385.24," Like if you're in the age of the crusades and people are covered with matriccy, the file digital crap, it's completely different."
1385.24,1386.24, Okay.
1386.24,1393.24," But when it is good, like when in the demo, they were chasing the person who tries to assassinate through their city streets and innerved crowds, it was briefly very cool and evocative."
1393.24,1397.24," And I thought, all right, wasn't cool and evocative was when they when they messed up."
1397.24,1400.24, And the guy they were chasing stopped and waited for them.
1400.24,1402.24," Oh no, it's hard to see."
1402.24,1404.24, It's hard to see.
1404.24,1408.24," Yeah, of course, because he was scared and ran away, but that was being scared and ran away."
1408.24,1410.24, He decided he was cocky and wanted to wait for them.
1410.24,1412.24," And also, I don't quite understand the combat yet."
1412.24,1415.24," I've been played it, Matt Leon played it. He said the combat was a little confusing."
1415.24,1421.24, It looked like it was basically pressed the button to to queue up a pretty animation of you killing someone.
1421.24,1427.24," While the guys behind you, way sit there and wait for you to it's definitely not an injured guy in school of attack block attack block."
1427.24,1431.24," And it was like, go up press your button and watch your fantasy."
1431.24,1433.24, That was like a scene out of a we should movie.
1433.24,1436.24," Wasn't it? It was like, dude falls into a middle of five guys."
1436.24,1439.24," And instead of them jumping him, they're like, oh, I'm gonna stand in line."
1439.24,1440.24, I'm gonna take my turn to get killed.
1440.24,1441.24," Yeah, just talking shit."
1441.24,1443.24," But get him dude, get him."
1443.24,1445.24, The world was very big and impressive.
1445.24,1449.24," However, there was a little texture filled happening and like, you know, that makes him polish."
1449.24,1450.24, Because they can fix that.
1450.24,1454.24," The parts that really concerned me out of this was the combat seemed weird,"
1454.24,1458.24," disjointed, button, pressy and like not really satisfying."
1458.24,1461.24," Like the weird, the crowd, the crowd AI, the crowd AI."
1461.24,1462.24, The crowd AI is supposed to be a big deal.
1462.24,1467.24, How did this dude run through this crowd and create all that chaos and not crowd clones is going to be a problem too.
1467.24,1469.24," You just like, you got to do something to him."
1469.24,1473.24," Because I mean, look what I was saying when I said a centipede of like jar bearing women."
1473.24,1476.24," Oh, you got to like make stuff to the character models a little more than that."
1476.24,1480.24," You know, but the thing that worked that did look good though is all the free running stuff."
1480.24,1481.24, That look really fun.
1481.24,1485.24," Yeah, it just navigating that big environment, you know, jumping from here."
1486.24,1488.24," All right, so overall on the world on Microsoft."
1488.24,1493.24," Well, I mean, I think they played two save with Xbox 360 and then when you get to the PC stuff,"
1493.24,1496.24," like, I didn't look at very exciting 90 to PC game or the main."
1496.24,1498.24," Well, based on what they showed in the real."
1498.24,1502.24," Well, dude, that's because they showed two minutes of B movie and then like again,"
1502.24,1505.24," it was like, deja vu and showing you the spider man game."
1505.24,1509.24," And then they get spider man, but I mean, when you're trying to define for the audience that was there,"
1509.24,1513.24, you're trying to define PC platform is being valid.
1513.24,1516.24, Then you don't sneak in 30 seconds of some of the most amazing crisis.
1516.24,1520.24," But it's definitely shown and make us go like, oh, six and then like,"
1520.24,1523.24," all of a sudden, it's B movie again, you know, and then a lot of this,"
1523.24,1528.24," the the reputation for kiddie games and just PC being the waste bin for development, you know,"
1528.24,1532.24, do you guys think that they did that to not upstage Halo 3 with crisis?
1532.24,1536.24," Well, but then they could hear easily stage Halo through the crisis."
1536.24,1537.24, I could say that.
1537.24,1538.24, That's true after my experience.
1538.24,1540.24," But years PC looked a lot like really really good, you know,"
1540.24,1542.24, and that did look great. And they did it.
1542.24,1544.24," And I think they how did I think the gears of stage,"
1544.24,1548.24," to fight with the brumack of stage, the Halo snippet they showed,"
1548.24,1550.24, that's not to say it's better games impressive.
1550.24,1552.24, But I think it was looking at it.
1552.24,1554.24," I was like, wow, I understand, like you were saying, Jon,"
1554.24,1557.24," I mean, someone was playing, it was clifpy playing that part."
1557.24,1559.24," And you're like, I understand how this works."
1559.24,1560.24, This looks really cool.
1560.24,1562.24," And it wasn't just this MTV like,"
1562.24,1565.24, you had a context that had the Halo trailer do not.
1565.24,1566.24, Yeah.
1566.24,1569.24," All right. So real quick, what you walk away from Microsoft thinking, Jon?"
1569.24,1571.24," Um, I mean, mainly that they've got to really solid."
1571.24,1573.24, There's a bunch of games that see it for 360.
1573.24,1575.24," I do want to play, like, mass effect."
1575.24,1577.24," And, you know, there's a bunch of good stuff."
1577.24,1581.24," But in terms of a, you know, here is looking to the future for 360."
1581.24,1583.24," I mean, there was no visibility on that hole."
1583.24,1585.24, But it was all about this holiday.
1585.24,1589.24," Shane, the live on the live arcade montage was a highlight for me."
1589.24,1592.24," Like, most everything they showed through there looked really awesome,"
1592.24,1593.24," and made me want to like,"
1593.24,1596.24," by some shame bucks on, uh, I don't think it's worth it."
1596.24,1597.24, I don't think it's worth it.
1597.24,1599.24," Well, it doesn't look good, but I mean, it's very,"
1599.24,1601.24," all of the other games that was like,"
1601.24,1603.24," they showed just enough to say, that looks pretty interesting."
1603.24,1605.24," Well, yeah, there's like, there's a cool, like, marble game."
1605.24,1607.24," There's some good, like, marble games and puzzle games and stuff."
1607.24,1609.24," And it looked like, hey, this looks like cool stuff."
1609.24,1611.24," But it wasn't, it wasn't golden axe and it wasn't sonic."
1611.24,1613.24, That's true. But it was worth the things.
1613.24,1614.24, I'll say it.
1614.24,1615.24, I'll say it.
1615.24,1617.24, Someone who doesn't understand what's a great amount of marathon.
1617.24,1619.24, That clip did not explain to me what's a great amount of money.
1619.24,1621.24, It's never been a beautiful game.
1621.24,1622.24," It's going to be in a style, Jeff."
1622.24,1623.24, Yeah.
1623.24,1625.24," Shane, as I said, like, they have a very solid lineup,"
1625.24,1627.24, and that's what they focused on.
1627.24,1630.24," But as with John said, I needed some more 2008."
1630.24,1633.24, I needed some things to give me excited for next year on this console.
1633.24,1635.24," Well, I'm hoping they have some stuff to do in 2008,"
1635.24,1638.24," but you know, it's really hard to argue with their lineup."
1638.24,1641.24," And this is something that we talked about, like, a couple of weeks ago."
1641.24,1643.24," They do have a very bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,"
1643.24,1645.24, holiday season coming up where every month.
1645.24,1648.24," They have, like, a potentially, oh, my God,"
1648.24,1650.24, blow it out the door.
1650.24,1652.24," You know, amazing, triple-a title."
1652.24,1654.24, So I think they have three.
1655.24,1656.24, Yeah.
1656.24,1658.24," Does being Mass Effect, Callditty, Halo."
1658.24,1660.24," And that little game, what's it?"
1660.24,1662.24," Oh, that's right. Grant theft on it."
1662.24,1663.24, We're going to come on guys.
1663.24,1666.24," That's a perfectly, that's a really, that's a really,"
1666.24,1668.24, and managed madness.
1668.24,1670.24, We're going to be in the first party to be on it.
1670.24,1671.24," Oh, okay."
1671.24,1672.24, I was going to add.
1672.24,1674.24, I wanted to add that they should have a new loss.
1674.24,1675.24," Obviously, trailer."
1675.24,1676.24, It looks a lot better than did a TGS.
1676.24,1678.24," I'm still not really sure, but it's really going to come out"
1678.24,1679.24, and December like they claim.
1679.24,1681.24," I'm doubtful on that, but it's looking a lot better."
1681.24,1683.24," Yeah, it's looking a lot better from the extent that it really,"
1683.24,1685.24," really, really looks like Final Fantasy now."
1685.24,1687.24," Well, not that it didn't before, but it, right?"
1687.24,1689.24, It looks like it doesn't look bad.
1689.24,1690.24," It doesn't look bad game, like, we should put it on."
1690.24,1691.24, We should put it on.
1691.24,1692.24, We should put it on.
1692.24,1693.24," Well, a TGS, the demo was just empty."
1693.24,1694.24," Anyway, all right."
1694.24,1695.24, So don't go anywhere.
1695.24,1697.24," When we come back, we're going to hook up on Nintendo"
1697.24,1700.24," and Sony, Patrick's going to grab a mic and we'll say goodbye to Sean."
1700.24,1704.24," Yeah, we're going to come back later so I can go in deeper and go in harder."
1704.24,1705.24," Like, I don't know, last segment."
1705.24,1709.24," Tomorrow, tomorrow, you should go in really deep on some of the best"
1709.24,1711.24," Croatian games you played, or whatever."
1711.24,1712.24, Okay.
1712.24,1712.74, Sounds good.
1712.74,1713.24, And I'm out.
1713.24,1714.24, I'm out.
1714.24,1715.24, I'm out.
1715.24,1716.24, Don't go anywhere.
1716.24,1716.74, We'll be right back.
1716.74,1719.74, Music
1724.74,1728.24, This one up podcast is brought to you by Windows Media Center.
1728.24,1732.74," Your Xbox 360, your music, your photos, your TV shows,"
1732.74,1734.74, and your videos with one connection.
1743.74,1744.74, All right.
1744.74,1747.74, We're back and ready to hit the other two big of the big way.
1747.74,1750.74, We actually forgot a giant hardware announcement in Microsoft.
1750.74,1751.74, There was so exciting.
1751.74,1752.74, Somehow forgot about it.
1752.74,1755.74," The fourth, the fourth 360 that was so exciting on the app pedestal."
1755.74,1756.74," Yeah, the Halo 3 limited edition."
1756.74,1759.74, I actually think it's pretty because I like orange.
1759.74,1760.74, But it's green.
1760.74,1762.74, But the Halo etching and stuff on it.
1762.74,1763.74, I don't know if you.
1763.74,1766.74," But yeah, when Petermore held it up, like no one cheered and were like"
1766.74,1768.74, He's a little straining a little bit.
1768.74,1770.74," Like, you're like, I'm trying to get it out of here."
1770.74,1773.74," And then like, see, try to crack a joke at the end and just put it away."
1773.74,1774.74, So it's going to go into the cool.
1774.74,1776.74," That was Patrick, you know, has a mic."
1776.74,1777.74, Patrick's here with us.
1777.74,1778.74," Oh, yes, hello."
1778.74,1779.74, Welcome to the show.
1779.74,1780.74, Welcome to the show.
1780.74,1782.74, I was before I was just waving my hands.
1782.74,1784.74," Yeah, the Halo 3, not the people that I've excited about."
1784.74,1786.74," Yeah, obviously Microsoft doesn't care much either because they put a 20 gig"
1786.74,1787.74, hard drive on it.
1787.74,1791.74," Oh, I guess some people might care about you."
1791.74,1793.74, I think it's got the wireless headset.
1793.74,1795.74, The Halo branding is not really obnoxious.
1795.74,1798.74," I saw on last night when I went to see Halo, they had one there."
1798.74,1799.74, Is it just like the?
1799.74,1802.74, It's a bit like the Halo zoom.
1802.74,1806.74," So like on the on the top side of it, there's a sort of the Halo, like sort of"
1806.74,1810.74, liner and then it's got the logo and then the this stuff that's
1810.74,1814.74, normally chrome on a premium is this sort of copper colour.
1814.74,1818.74," And then the hard drive, all of the chrome stuff on the on the hard drive is"
1818.74,1821.74, some is copper colour as well and it has the Halo logo on that that's
1821.74,1823.74, strip in the middle of the hard drive.
1823.74,1825.74, Is it expensive in the premium?
1825.74,1826.74, They don't know the price.
1826.74,1827.74, The bungee goes down at the price.
1827.74,1830.74," Well, they do know mind to buy something like that."
1830.74,1832.74, Aren't you the kind of person who buys premium kit.
1832.74,1835.74, So wouldn't you want to have the big hard drive and not just the little
1835.74,1836.74, cheesy 20?
1836.74,1840.74, You can buy it as a hundred and seventy-nine dollar accessory.
1840.74,1841.74, Yeah.
1841.74,1843.74, It's not like there is an solution to this problem.
1843.74,1846.74," Well, from one disappointment to another, do you next"
1846.74,1849.74, can next attend to the Nintendo press conference?
1849.74,1853.74, I was like try to be the person that like I really do love my
1853.74,1857.74, and like I don't have a problem with the casual games and like I don't have a
1857.74,1861.74, problem with Nintendo's approach but like the I mean I was just like I
1861.74,1864.74, live blog the event and it was just like it was just like
1864.74,1865.74, a little terror.
1865.74,1868.74, Last year they had an amazing press conference where we all got sold and we all
1868.74,1869.74, yeah we all came out like converted.
1869.74,1870.74, Yeah.
1870.74,1873.74," Well, I think I think it's really telling that like last year they had to"
1873.74,1876.74, convert us because they have this brand new concept and someone
1876.74,1879.74, needs to buy it that first week and that was the hard core.
1879.74,1880.74, Now everyone else is buying it.
1880.74,1882.74, So why would they cater to us?
1882.74,1885.74," Like, they instead decided to show us about you know 20 minutes of YouTube."
1885.74,1887.74," Yeah, that was kind of great."
1887.74,1889.74," Yeah, it was like, hey Nintendo aren't we great."
1889.74,1893.74, Let's show a bunch of YouTube videos on like headlines and it's just like
1893.74,1896.74, good old but like that was every transition like every ten minutes
1896.74,1899.74, it was like 30 or 40 seconds of like Nintendo have like we're selling
1899.74,1900.74, great.
1900.74,1901.74, No shit.
1901.74,1903.74," Yeah, as we predicted they they they they talked about how well they're doing"
1903.74,1905.74, and because they're doing really really really well and they also
1905.74,1908.74, talked about how they're bringing all these new gamers like older
1908.74,1911.74, women gamers they like they talked about grandma's grandma's
1911.74,1913.74, we're discussed as we predicted.
1913.74,1914.74, And I'm with you.
1914.74,1918.74, I'm down with the casual stuff and the you know and but I honestly
1918.74,1920.74, thought they were going to balance it better.
1920.74,1922.74," Like, you got a big reveal like."
1922.74,1923.74, Right.
1923.74,1925.74, I mean like new me and Moto E.P.
1925.74,1927.74, I.P. was like you know there'll be something like a teaser like
1927.74,1931.74, something's coming in 2008 like very got the 2007 line up like a
1931.74,1932.74, establishment.
1932.74,1935.74, You know what's coming but like there was nothing and they just tried to
1935.74,1937.74, like trapeze through it and it was just in salt.
1937.74,1939.74," Well, the big reveals were mostly non games."
1939.74,1942.74, It mean while the you know the core games were kind of
1942.74,1945.74, shuffle by like Mario Kart Wii gets mentioned in passing
1945.74,1946.74, showing a small video.
1946.74,1948.74, It doesn't look that great.
1948.74,1951.74, It looks like a game you game as predicted and it looks
1951.74,1952.74, simpler.
1952.74,1954.74, It looks like they took a lot of the complexity from double dash that I enjoyed
1954.74,1955.74, out of the game.
1955.74,1956.74," Yeah, there's no there's no extra layer to it."
1956.74,1958.74, It's just like he was like a well game.
1958.74,1960.74, Can we get my hand out of my play.
1960.74,1962.74, It doesn't have on my play which is good but then red
1962.74,1964.74, you was like oh and we hear is a way that will
1964.74,1967.74, even the playing field for expert players and new players and
1967.74,1968.74, the players.
1968.74,1970.74, So it was essentially the same little fake steering wheel you
1970.74,1972.74, slot your controller and that you be soft had at launch
1972.74,1975.74, where you can now play you know with a little steering.
1975.74,1976.74," Yeah, I didn't understand."
1976.74,1978.74, I was like this is already out there like what's the.
1978.74,1981.74, What's going on it wasn't there but he had to head about this.
1981.74,1984.74," So yeah, there is now a we branded wheel that is just a"
1984.74,1985.74, white plastic.
1985.74,1988.74, And as he was holding up like for the photographers like he like
1988.74,1989.74, you know turn it around.
1989.74,1990.74, It's got the wheel on it.
1990.74,1992.74, It's actually the second peripheral day now.
1992.74,1993.74, It's the first one was cooler.
1993.74,1994.74, It's the Zapper attachment.
1994.74,1995.74," Yeah, okay."
1995.74,1998.74," Yeah, because damn it I hate the fact that like people get upset"
1998.74,2001.74, about us hating on the Wii because I don't think any of us
2001.74,2004.74, here really hates the Wii and I love my guard.
2004.74,2006.74," Yeah, and a lot of us grew up playing Nintendo games."
2006.74,2010.74, We really love Nintendo games but really really he showed the
2010.74,2013.74, we saw a plastic steering wheel with a with a Wii branding on it.
2013.74,2020.74, To play Mario Kart about Mario Kart is about is about the
2020.74,2022.74, jump slide turn.
2022.74,2024.74, It's not about an I'm driving with a steering wheel.
2024.74,2026.74, So I'm concerned about how many buttons you'll be able to access.
2026.74,2028.74, Like I'm thinking the most would be three.
2028.74,2031.74," Yeah, we were trying to work it out earlier because you like when you"
2031.74,2034.74, when you tend with the same with the Ub oil and you slot that thing
2034.74,2036.74, across the the so it's the middle bar of the wheel.
2036.74,2037.74, Right.
2037.74,2040.74, To reach the A button is essentially in the middle so that you
2040.74,2042.74, you'd have to read a bit of a reach around to get it.
2042.74,2046.74, So you're looking at the the the one and two button and then
2046.74,2049.74, the trigger on the back and that's a lot which for old
2049.74,2052.74, Mario Kart is fine but anything like double dash which
2052.74,2054.74, which go more complicated.
2054.74,2056.74, Trader and so they're going that direction.
2056.74,2057.74, Well yeah the trailer was very simple.
2057.74,2058.74, I felt it.
2058.74,2060.74, I didn't mean to break in there just because.
2060.74,2064.74, That just blows my mind that then you don't even worry about a steering wheel
2064.74,2065.74, for Mario Kart.
2065.74,2068.74, Mario Kart is just that it's a whole other sort of drive.
2068.74,2071.74, It was a weird conference because they kept bouncing around from
2071.74,2074.74, DS to to we from non game to serious game.
2074.74,2077.74," And then there were things like this video of a family,"
2077.74,2080.74, the suburban family and Texas that somehow Nintendo had chosen to play
2080.74,2082.74, all their games that I wish we could play like this family has
2082.74,2083.74, Mario Sunshine.
2083.74,2084.74, I wish I could play Mario Sunshine.
2084.74,2086.74, Yeah I would have been going to go like see.
2086.74,2088.74, You've already played Mario Sunshine.
2088.74,2090.74, Yeah I said well I just did it because actually when played
2090.74,2091.74, Mario Galaxy.
2091.74,2093.74, I was saying we were talking about this like.
2093.74,2094.74, Looks like a lot like shine.
2094.74,2097.74, And yeah this is going to you know.
2097.74,2100.74, I'm just a lot of people off but I got to say I was a little
2100.74,2101.74, disappointed.
2101.74,2103.74, I played the last year and there was some changes.
2103.74,2105.74, There's now a two player thing throughout like that I was
2105.74,2106.74, surprised you to me.
2106.74,2111.74, So the second player with with a nunchuck can control this little
2111.74,2116.74, cursor on screen or the remote and like take these on
2116.74,2118.74, chips you collect as Mario.
2118.74,2120.74, So the first player collects these chips and he can the second
2120.74,2125.74, player can spend those chips to stun enemies or deflect shots
2125.74,2126.74, and you can also pick up chips.
2126.74,2129.74, So it's a cool way for like your little brother or like your
2129.74,2131.74, girlfriend or whatever to pick on playing with you.
2131.74,2133.74, So I like I think it's actually a good addition.
2133.74,2136.74, So it's like a true colabas kind of like if someone's in the room.
2136.74,2139.74, Well while we were playing Jeremy kept accidentally
2139.74,2142.74, like stunting me because you can also stun Mario and I'd be trying to
2142.74,2145.74, like hit enemy and he tried to like collect a coin and he was
2145.74,2147.74, that stun me and I was like I couldn't like he didn't mean to.
2147.74,2150.74, So the main thing you did you play it single player like is it.
2150.74,2152.74, Whoa that is a point isn't like.
2152.74,2156.74, So the control is great and the graphics are attractive for
2156.74,2159.74, for a week game like this has some good looking stuff.
2159.74,2162.74, But you know the level design it doesn't do it for me.
2162.74,2165.74, The whole level we played was two of those little plantoids.
2165.74,2168.74, Like they're really small and like it's it's not to me smaller
2168.74,2170.74, than any level in Mario 64.
2170.74,2173.74, Do you not like it because it's small because it's kind of weird.
2173.74,2176.74, Well the weird doesn't really bother me because I like
2176.74,2180.74, Mario Sunshine because it was weird too and you know this is very much the same way.
2180.74,2182.74, Like the space theme is all these different characters is like
2182.74,2186.74, very princess you never met before and you know it feels very different.
2186.74,2189.74, But yeah like it doesn't really feel it doesn't feel like real
2189.74,2191.74, worlds and that's kind of what I thought.
2191.74,2194.74, You think on his little planets and you go inside of them and
2194.74,2199.74, you're always like walk on ceilings and you can't the camera is kind of hard to move
2199.74,2202.74, around you don't have a lot of control over the camera but you know the basic game plays really fun.
2202.74,2205.74, I played the bumblebee suit that's fun you're flying around.
2205.74,2207.74, It's really good.
2207.74,2210.74, I'm sure you have now talked about Mario Galaxy more than Nintendo did today.
2210.74,2212.74, Exactly and like that's the status.
2212.74,2213.74, Yeah.
2213.74,2215.74, They kind of passed it was a passing at the present.
2215.74,2217.74, It was like oh yeah it was in the middle of the press conference.
2217.74,2218.74, It wasn't like a milestone.
2218.74,2222.74, It was like one of the transition things like they show this family playing Mario Galaxy
2222.74,2224.74, like it was not brought up at all during the conference.
2224.74,2226.74, They announced a release date you know.
2226.74,2227.74, Yeah.
2227.74,2228.74, That's it.
2228.74,2229.74, That I would never have guessed.
2229.74,2230.74, I mean they're.
2230.74,2233.74, I mean it's like Disney not talking about Mickey Mouse.
2233.74,2236.74, Well yeah and as I was playing it it was this weird combination of wow I'm playing a new
2236.74,2238.74, Mario game and that's great.
2238.74,2242.74, But you know this is an exactly what I would have wanted but it's great.
2242.74,2246.74, Yeah but definitely I've two minds of this game and like I haven't quite given me terms.
2246.74,2250.74, They seem to feel that we would be more impressed by the dates that they dropped
2250.74,2251.74, on this and smash brothers.
2251.74,2255.74, They would like you know this classic press conference moments where we're like we are
2255.74,2259.74, pleased to announce that this game will be available and we spoke with a December third
2259.74,2260.74, and it was like complete slide.
2260.74,2261.74, Yeah pause for a while.
2261.74,2266.74, I was live vlogging like I could see the teleprompter and like I could see this speech coming
2266.74,2267.74, like a couple of things.
2267.74,2270.74, I don't know like there would be there would be like slight pause and then like long pause
2270.74,2274.74, and then like before the smash brothers we were like very long pause and like nobody
2274.74,2278.74, cares because you're like you guys is big build up and we're pleased to finally announce
2278.74,2281.74, release date and it's like you think he's gonna say like next month or like
2281.74,2282.74, September and it was a bit better.
2282.74,2287.74, After the sales season like yeah he's build up was not next year not next spring
2287.74,2290.74, but you like he's building up to this like not tomorrow.
2290.74,2293.74, It's gonna be like a copy that way out.
2293.74,2298.74, But though December the New York and actually with the bummy out was like they
2298.74,2301.74, they try to like trump up like online play and like we can talk about like the
2301.74,2305.74, disappointments there but like smash brothers completely not mentioned it all
2305.74,2308.74, and like at this point I'm willing to believe like smash brothers like does not have online
2308.74,2310.74, play at this point and it's been removed.
2310.74,2314.74, Well we mentioned the zapper attachment which I also got the play I got the play
2314.74,2318.74, Resident Evil and I'm brought a Chronicles with the zapper and I do like the zapper
2318.74,2322.74, like it really changed the game and made it more fun because it feels almost like an FPS
2322.74,2324.74, because you're looking around and you're shooting.
2324.74,2328.74, The only thing I don't like about it is there's almost no force feedback.
2328.74,2332.74, I think maybe the beam was vibrating a little tiny bit but you couldn't really feel it
2332.74,2335.74, and the game doesn't give you a very good indication when you're shooting things.
2335.74,2338.74, So like a lot of times I was shooting my machine gun and I just kind of felt like am I
2338.74,2342.74, hitting things can't really tell so it turns your wemo into a super scope.
2342.74,2345.74, It does but you have the nunchuck to move around so that's a bad thing.
2345.74,2347.74, It's a little bit easier to hold than a super scope.
2347.74,2350.74, I think it actually has a lot of potential.
2350.74,2351.74, I think so I was a bad thing.
2351.74,2353.74, I thought you were just being the same thing.
2353.74,2357.74, I think this app is actually pretty cool and I just wish there was a way for a
2357.74,2361.74, to rumble more but yeah and in Resident Evil it's more fun than I thought it would be
2361.74,2362.74, too.
2362.74,2363.74, It's more fun with the zapper.
2363.74,2364.74, The graphics are pretty good for a week.
2364.74,2365.74, It's too clear to up.
2365.74,2366.74, Too clear to up.
2366.74,2367.74, Yeah branching paths.
2367.74,2368.74, There's a lot too.
2368.74,2369.74, Yeah.
2369.74,2370.74, I'm impressed.
2370.74,2375.74, How does the because like it wasn't really obvious from the pictures but because it's the
2375.74,2381.74, the wemo and the nunchuck wide together and then sort of then both of them popped into this device.
2381.74,2385.74, How does it how does it facilitate the connection between is it like it is it like all
2385.74,2388.74, threaded through little passageways or is it fairly clumsy?
2388.74,2391.74, It was all put together and kind of handed to me to tell me not to take it apart.
2391.74,2392.74, I don't know.
2392.74,2395.74, Maybe that's indicative of how like one of the people together.
2395.74,2400.74, There was one game I think I didn't quite like the head shots in the are you want to do
2400.74,2404.74, them because it's a difference between one shot and like ten shots but it's really small
2404.74,2407.74, pinpoint and when you when you do get there it gives you a little representation by
2407.74,2409.74, making a really really small all of a sudden.
2409.74,2412.74, So you're like all of a sudden you're ready to go to the tiny and you're like
2412.74,2413.74, desperately trying to hit it.
2413.74,2415.74, So but it's still good.
2415.74,2416.74, I like it.
2416.74,2420.74, And the other thing what the big reveal at the very end of the press conference was me
2420.74,2421.74, moto he comes out here.
2421.74,2425.74, You're like this is it his new IP we're all like what's going to be kiddicker is fighting
2425.74,2426.74, urban champion.
2426.74,2428.74, There's still like 20 minutes left at the camera.
2428.74,2431.74, So like it seems like there's going to be like something really big going on.
2431.74,2436.74, And as we predicted many times it's we fitness it's actually called we fit.
2436.74,2437.74, Yes.
2437.74,2440.74, And what it basically is this yoga mat scale thing.
2440.74,2444.74, Yeah it's like a separate accessory that you stand on and it's like it's like
2444.74,2448.74, having like a stepping map but like it's got like accelerometer is it the pressure
2448.74,2451.74, conference the reveal not so good because it had three three personal
2451.74,2455.74, trainers up there and it wasn't really working and me moto was like oh it's not
2455.74,2457.74, really working the way it's supposed to I'm sorry.
2457.74,2460.74, He's come play it and it really doesn't work and yeah like you know they
2460.74,2463.74, were doing these balances and stretches and they were supposed to be
2463.74,2466.74, showing it was a way that like I'm like they were like doing it correctly but like
2466.74,2470.74, the sensitivity was off or it was not collaborated and like it was just kind of like
2470.74,2474.74, it was already frustrating that it was 20 minutes long over this like one
2474.74,2478.74, reveal you went and played it right I got to go play we fit and I got to say
2478.74,2481.74, it does actually work unlike at the press conference where it doesn't like
2481.74,2485.74, right so Jeremy and I played several of the exercises and some like line
2485.74,2490.74, dancing I did the balancing I did there's the hitting
2490.74,2493.74, soccer balls in there's one where you're doing a ski jump there's one where
2493.74,2497.74, you're moving around some balls on a trying to get in through
2497.74,2499.74, holes we were telling that's like the coolest one like one of the
2499.74,2503.74, cousins stand on top of like the exercise matter whatever they're
2503.74,2507.74, calling it and the way you move like your body weight is how you're
2507.74,2511.74, shifting this table to get like a marble and all it's like a simple but like
2511.74,2515.74, it's a cool you say and you know balance thing when you first stand on this thing
2515.74,2518.74, it's a very strange feeling you've never really done this it's a field
2518.74,2522.74, cheat like it's just like no it's really big actually it's a large
2522.74,2526.74, and of course four batteries and what people think to understand about it
2526.74,2529.74, because from a lot of the videos a lot of the exercises there's like a lot of
2529.74,2532.74, yoga in the game right so there's a lot of people moving their arms around
2532.74,2535.74, and doing things and it can't pick up what you're
2535.74,2538.74, hands are doing it is purely it's essentially the a lot of the
2538.74,2542.74, accelerometer functionality from the from the wemo in a pad so it's
2542.74,2544.74, sentencing it's essentially sensing where you'll weight shit right yeah
2544.74,2547.74, it's all about shifting your weight it's the whole unless you're
2547.74,2550.74, following what they're doing like you're not going to get the full
2550.74,2554.74, like that's just judging if you're on you're just following your arms
2554.74,2556.74, or like it doesn't know you're doing that like if you want the full
2556.74,2559.74, of like so they might tell you to put your arms out because it'll help you
2559.74,2562.74, with the steering but that's why it's asking you to do arm movements
2562.74,2566.74, it's not picking up that you've moved your arms but I will say it was
2566.74,2570.74, weirdly addictive like these strange tasks and if I would fail that I'd
2570.74,2573.74, like I can I can balance on one leg let me try that again you know like I
2573.74,2576.74, want to do it again I wanted to improve but at the same time it's not
2576.74,2579.74, something I see myself coming back and checking your graph I could say
2579.74,2581.74, there was a playing in a few times a week but you know you
2581.74,2585.74, would do for an hour I think we're going to see people doing other things
2585.74,2588.74, with that control although I mean the obvious one is you you turn it
2588.74,2592.74, through ninety degrees and it's a skateboard or a snowball
2592.74,2595.74, Sega had a arcade game top skater be perfect for that yeah yeah
2595.74,2598.74, I mean I think it's an interesting addition I think it's it's going to
2598.74,2600.74, get a lot of positive press from the mainstream media because like
2600.74,2604.74, yeah it is a yoga game that's why it's been so much time I'm
2604.74,2607.74, like next to where I was live logging like USA today like had a
2607.74,2610.74, section where like they were going to stream a lot like the
2610.74,2614.74, conference and like they didn't show up but like they like USA today
2614.74,2617.74, had like set up we're in 10 out to stream the camera like
2617.74,2620.74, know that they care enough at least looking at the positive streaming
2620.74,2624.74, in 10 out of E3 cameras like shows you know 10 out of
2624.74,2627.74, what they wanted to do that okay so let's wrap up in 10 out of
2627.74,2630.74, here real quick because I want to make sure we get the Sony before we like
2630.74,2633.74, drag well I went I went talk a little more in 10 out I still some more
2633.74,2636.74, to say actually more I do because you know we we had said that this
2636.74,2639.74, was going to be a show where core gamers are disappointed and it
2639.74,2641.74, was like instead of announcing kidacris and they announced yoga I mean
2641.74,2644.74, they did they really did and and everyone was like oh wait third
2644.74,2646.74, party is going to come through no they didn't third party is
2646.74,2649.74, not coming through like third party yeah I'm fully
2649.74,2651.74, mouth third party I didn't see those third party is a
2651.74,2654.74, announcing deal same they're doing so I have to wait for less
2654.74,2657.74, I thought we had 100 100 I had that list here I can tell you how
2657.74,2661.74, about Garfield gets real how about Garfield the young
2661.74,2666.74, kidaling cats he does like cats seriously they are almost no serious
2666.74,2669.74, core gamer games announced for we from third party series okay
2669.74,2673.74, our old casual license which is which we talked about a few months ago
2673.74,2676.74, where you know if that party is going to know anywhere initially
2676.74,2679.74, it was going to be yeah the we is going to be the home for the license
2679.74,2682.74, properties but I thought at least this you see we'd see like some sort of
2682.74,2687.74, commitment like trying to get a yes casual games are good I've heard
2687.74,2690.74, from ever do you play the EA we stuff it's casual but it's good that's
2690.74,2693.74, what I've heard so I've seen those myself my sims I mean it's you know
2693.74,2696.74, it's it's different it doesn't have that weird gangly
2696.74,2699.74, sims look I mean it's it's kind of like what I'm hoping for like something
2699.74,2701.74, that's like somewhere in between like it's casual but it's not like you
2701.74,2704.74, can see yourself like enjoying it and like something like animal
2704.74,2707.74, crossing like and you know we're not we're just not seeing stuff like that
2707.74,2710.74, and that was ultimately was well I'm not getting this series is third
2710.74,2713.74, party saying yes we need to get on board but they're not ready to
2713.74,2716.74, really show what it was because I know they were confident when
2716.74,2718.74, the way it was announced that this was going to be big so now it's so
2718.74,2722.74, you can't remember that they don't know what we can we get out and we
2722.74,2726.74, now so we can make some money carnival games by take to yeah well
2726.74,2730.74, another disappointment you know I predict the DS would be the show far
2730.74,2735.74, from it there's not much here nothing and it's a focus training
2735.74,2737.74, well for the training is actually pretty cool that's the observation
2737.74,2740.74, training it's coming in October and it's also quite we announced
2740.74,2742.74, Maria party for DS
2742.74,2747.74, professor late in comes out December third and level five like
2747.74,2750.74, up somewhere weird game like it's coming out here it's been a gun is
2750.74,2753.74, mentioned that Nintendo magic which is like one of the non-games in
2753.74,2756.74, Japan a teacher's card tricks that was a flop and actually clear
2756.74,2758.74, as I saw for like $10 and I'm like why are they bringing that clear
2758.74,2763.74, and clear it's the S game in Japan but you know we sort of
2763.74,2766.74, skewed it over it first of light and right first of all come here in
2766.74,2769.74, America from Nintendo December that's that's great that is great
2769.74,2771.74, you would think that they would maybe have mentioned that just
2771.74,2774.74, probably just put a low-glub say look level five like and then people
2774.74,2778.74, would like yeah they're like trying but there's also a first party
2778.74,2781.74, we game that is coming out of October that was not mentioned it's called
2781.74,2785.74, endless ocean that's right that is also fire of him has a date
2785.74,2789.74, of November fifth is we didn't show some like underwater ocean
2789.74,2792.74, game at some point we think they had dolphins like last year
2792.74,2795.74, that's probably it but we would know that it was absolutely you were
2795.74,2799.74, excited about and I'm sure you're very disappointed no project
2799.74,2802.74, I knew it I knew someone that bring it up to Sasha Dave price
2802.74,2806.74, oh no they were both on like in time as price like before the updated
2806.74,2809.74, their press conference removed completely from the schedule those games are
2809.74,2815.74, gone and actually having a more alright so Nintendo bomber bomber I
2815.74,2818.74, think I mean they I think they achieved what they wanted to but for I
2818.74,2821.74, think for this event I don't I don't think it went out well we fit
2821.74,2826.74, is going to be just huge unless they charge some exorbitant amount
2826.74,2829.74, or even then I think it's done given the house successful guitar
2829.74,2832.74, hero was then you know they could charge anything up to 90 bucks for it
2832.74,2836.74, and probably sell I think they've an excellent fall line up for
2836.74,2839.74, DS and we but they didn't give me a lot of stuff to be excited about
2839.74,2842.74, for next year no yeah mainstream outlets are going to eat this up
2842.74,2845.74, but like this is the three like they should have thrown hard core bone
2845.74,2849.74, and they didn't and like it's just disappointing like they did what
2849.74,2852.74, they wanted to do and like that's great but like I came out of it like
2852.74,2855.74, upset and disappointed ready for Sony to do something better
2855.74,2859.74, alright how about the defense force what are you talking about
2859.74,2862.74, does it need to be a defense force act on that I you know I mean
2862.74,2866.74, well job judge turns to be hearing the when we've sent extra
2866.74,2870.74, the conference unlike it was fairly clear within about 10-15 minutes that
2870.74,2874.74, this was because like we were going in like someone has to pull out
2874.74,2877.74, something or do something that make us feel like you know the whole
2877.74,2882.74, event was worth coming out on money and and so I think Sony pulled it off
2882.74,2885.74, they they don't need they did their homework they did that homework they
2885.74,2889.74, took notes they knew what people expected from them and when people
2889.74,2892.74, didn't want from them and they and they delivered what they needed
2892.74,2895.74, to live they weren't they weren't corporate they prove they have a
2895.74,2898.74, great to that 2007 lineup and they have games coming away that we want to see
2898.74,2901.74, we didn't it was like is that does that sound familiar to anybody
2901.74,2904.74, what sound familiar what he said I think it sounds kind of familiar to
2904.74,2908.74, something I was saying going it was right who knew who knew I know I mean
2908.74,2911.74, okay I also only missed on Nintendo apparently I also got to say
2911.74,2915.74, shame was right and people say I'm always wrong unreal shame was right
2915.74,2919.74, he's changed right like I call those yeah we know what did you call
2919.74,2924.74, music clues are time excuses all right well so okay so break into
2924.74,2927.74, Sony so bus break down Sony for because actually I saw Mark
2927.74,2930.74, rain this afternoon and we talked a little bit about the the unreal
2930.74,2934.74, situation and he said you know what look we announced on p.s.
2934.74,2937.74, three as far as consoles in the first place where did you think we would be
2937.74,2940.74, on consoles first I mean obviously there's more to it than that
2940.74,2944.74, well they described it as a multi part agreement and the first part is
2944.74,2948.74, Mac is maximizing unreal of three engine finally for PS3 so games will
2948.74,2951.74, stop you know it gives up in cancelled that you said that would be
2951.74,2956.74, good idea and you T3 is exclusive and it's going to have
2956.74,2959.74, it's going to have a lot more from the PC which is huge and I mean I was
2959.74,2962.74, talking to me like it's it's going to be totally open like they're going
2962.74,2965.74, to have a there's going to be like a filter system that's not just me like
2965.74,2969.74, upload whatever you want but like it's not it's I mean they pointed out like
2969.74,2972.74, this is an open platform and like epic it's all along with unreal
2972.74,2975.74, term and like even when it's a 360 game like they want to do
2975.74,2978.74, mod stuff like that is what unreal tournament is this is not years of
2978.74,2982.74, war like anything gears war has a level that are down the PC
2982.74,2985.74, side like unreal tournament is about mods like this is like you know
2985.74,2987.74, quakes shipping without something like that like that would you
2987.74,2990.74, monumental air and like it's about user experience like they're
2990.74,2993.74, bringing that makes me really really excited and like for hardcore
2993.74,2997.74, UT fans I mean it looked really good and if you want like the mouse
2997.74,3000.74, keyboard set up there is this third party control like the Razor effects
3000.74,3002.74, that really is like a mouse and keyboard for PS3 working out for
3002.74,3005.74, resistance I think would work great for unreal well so that was what
3005.74,3008.74, talked about it the the mod ability and that is really cool the only
3008.74,3011.74, filter they have to put on there is the you know the internal memory
3011.74,3015.74, limit of the PS3 being 512 mega other than that he said you know you
3015.74,3020.74, even able to what was cool you'll be able to make levels on your PC
3020.74,3023.74, and share them with everybody and it's not even like it's not even like
3023.74,3026.74, you've got like sit down like poor the PS3 like it's being built
3026.74,3029.74, from the ground up for both platforms or you just build it on PC and
3029.74,3032.74, you dump it on like the filter system and it's like YouTube it shows up
3032.74,3035.74, like X amount of hours later and like you can download and I'm sure
3035.74,3038.74, that like ranking systems and voting like it's going to be really
3038.74,3041.74, really cool the only thing I can throw 360 fans out of that is that
3041.74,3045.74, it is going to come to 360 next year and same with hey same with
3045.74,3049.74, hey and it won't come to 360 without that same functionality
3049.74,3054.74, but in the same like I'd say maybe it'll come and maybe we'll get like
3054.74,3057.74, it's his packages but I can not see Microsoft opening up the platform
3057.74,3060.74, for Epic and allowing them to just dump whatever you just want
3060.74,3066.74, I think we take it would take a strong motivational force
3066.74,3071.74, to get the Xbox live team to start figuring out how to do
3071.74,3075.74, user generated content through the live system and maybe this announcement
3075.74,3079.74, was part of that hmm it was implying pressure because it's going to be
3079.74,3083.74, pressure on the gifts stuff as well because technically it's possible
3083.74,3088.74, three gears hmm what do you know so the other big ex-cocivity announcement
3088.74,3091.74, which I had never heard of actually was in CS off and I wasn't sure how big of a
3091.74,3095.74, deal that is if lineage is a big deal but I think that was a big deal
3095.74,3099.74, well it's it's a mix of things like what they're doing and like even
3099.74,3101.74, Sony's not really sure what they're doing it's just kind of a too
3101.74,3104.74, ex-cocivity deal you know well maybe we'll see like the Guild Wars team
3104.74,3107.74, is like expressing interest in doing something like it's going to be a mix
3107.74,3109.74, of original and new IP so it sounds like we'll get something like
3109.74,3112.74, well probably Guild Wars like that's like their nc-suff's big game
3112.74,3116.74, or maybe it's like was a tibula rossa like the new one
3116.74,3120.74, yeah I think Guild Wars is like an action RPG
3120.74,3123.74, yeah you'll simple it's not actually an MMO which is like is popular
3123.74,3126.74, with a bunch of people everything's instanced so it probably like a port of that
3126.74,3129.74, and then like they're building something new from the ground up
3129.74,3132.74, for the PS3 actually we should take a break from PS3 and talk real fast
3132.74,3135.74, about PSP because I think PSP had like a crazy good showing
3135.74,3138.74, like they showed that Sony is really competitive and really serious about
3138.74,3142.74, fighting the S with the value added to the new device looks pretty interesting
3142.74,3145.74, I mean that you know they've cleaned it up a little bit
3145.74,3150.74, and the TV out is pretty cool I think the old bad battery life is cool
3150.74,3155.74, new colors yeah I mean the silver didn't look great it actually looks more like
3155.74,3159.74, sparkly I was like I think like bring that white one over that yeah
3159.74,3163.74, well the Star Wars pack that's a good deal that's a new game with the system
3163.74,3167.74, you're saving like 30 bucks and like the daxter one you're a sense of getting the
3167.74,3171.74, gig stick for free with that yeah you know but I mean I had a great showing
3171.74,3175.74, I mean the Star Wars game sure will be huge this is a game that I cannot
3175.74,3180.74, remember the name of Patopon Patopon Patopon is not playable here apparently
3180.74,3183.74, it's a combination of like it's a Japanese and French development team
3183.74,3187.74, because it has the sort of loco roco aesthetic but a kind of
3187.74,3192.74, we're more strategic let me sort of lemon and worms he kind of gameplay
3192.74,3195.74, it was very bizarre but it was nice to see stuff like that that's what's
3195.74,3199.74, like a echo chrome like weird weird stuff like I don't know where I don't
3199.74,3202.74, want to play that I'm actually I think I would rather play echo chrome on
3202.74,3207.74, PSP which is coming out yeah if you had to echo chrome which is like
3207.74,3211.74, avant-garde like MC Escher it's out of their Japanese studio it's like
3211.74,3214.74, crush mix them see Escher almost yeah it's very crush like where you're
3214.74,3217.74, like chain perspective and you're dropping and bouncing around but like it's
3217.74,3220.74, a bit like it's gone it wasn't there so what it is is it's completely
3220.74,3227.74, white screen and everything is just black line up so the initial level they
3227.74,3232.74, show you is a very simple like Escher type illustration that you can
3232.74,3236.74, rotate so there's a break in it and if you rotate it the break goes away
3236.74,3241.74, so whereas in crush you're taking a 3D thing and spinning it until
3241.74,3246.74, when you flatten it into two dimensions you be able to progress in this
3246.74,3251.74, as you rotate it in three dimensions if you cover up any gap in the
3251.74,3259.74, environment then apply it as your but it's all it's just black line up
3259.74,3263.74, control it well you control a little guy who has to walk around and he's
3263.74,3266.74, based on one of those little artists posing dolls you know the wooden
3266.74,3270.74, things and you walk the guy around and you have to get from one point on the
3270.74,3274.74, illustration to the other and they start off really simple and then it gets
3274.74,3278.74, incredibly complex because you'll drop through a hole and then you'll land
3278.74,3282.74, somewhat unexpected because it messes with the perspective and then you have to
3282.74,3285.74, rotate things until you can eventually get through all the checkpoints
3285.74,3289.74, or whatever and it's like it's very different is very avant-garde it's like
3289.74,3293.74, it's only black and white I mean it's kind of cool kind of
3293.74,3296.74, yeah I want to see it well like the piercens stuff around the gamut from that
3296.74,3299.74, to like you know Warhawk and socom which are very full featured next
3299.74,3302.74, gen style games so these more simple weird cool things like flow and
3302.74,3306.74, yeah so wipe out HD oh wow look like look a lot better than I thought
3306.74,3311.74, I like it wasn't just I was so really nice like I like I'm so yeah
3311.74,3315.74, I look really really really really look a lot a lot better than I thought
3315.74,3319.74, like no it might be I will say it looks better than feed on version I'm not kidding
3319.74,3323.74, it's it's extremely sharp what they took is they took the the aesthetic
3323.74,3327.74, from the from the older games and they just they just rather than going crazy
3327.74,3330.74, I mean it is it is a sort of what I've had 1.5 kind of product right
3330.74,3334.74, but the way they compensated for that is by it's like super clean super high
3334.74,3337.74, rare is very almost flat I'm not telling that what I'm saying is how is
3337.74,3341.74, that a surprise I'm not surprised that the wipe out team made a really
3341.74,3345.74, really cool looking game in the future I think it was the story that
3345.74,3348.74, it was more of a 1.5 product that people are thinking it's going to be like
3348.74,3351.74, make your face to game making a real one so you're wondering what I'm going to
3351.74,3354.74, have what that look like something else was really pleased with
3354.74,3358.74, they showed some actually they launched it from home so I mean
3358.74,3361.74, I'm going to go back home again in a minute but they showed the next download
3361.74,3365.74, pack from modestorm where now modestorm really is finished
3365.74,3370.74, because one of the tracks it's a completely new track that's like a
3370.74,3374.74, figure I eat with with bank corners and a bunch of new vehicles
3374.74,3378.74, that they're throwing into it as well and it looked great and I went up and I
3378.74,3381.74, played it really briefly and there's like a school bus and these little
3381.74,3386.74, kids are in charge you cost my little cost yeah I believe because the
3386.74,3389.74, track was free that's what you're going to call track back it's like
3389.74,3392.74, it's in a different part of the installation game design make it
3392.74,3396.74, 70% finished put it out sell the rest on the market but they
3396.74,3401.74, that's how they they launched this new modestorm level from home so
3401.74,3405.74, he walked into that they've they've revamped a lot of the UI and the
3405.74,3408.74, sort of central hub is no longer a shopping mall it's like a big open
3408.74,3413.74, space and they went to fills house in home and there was a bunch of
3413.74,3418.74, people there and he said okay let's play some multiplayer modestorm
3418.74,3421.74, and it just launched straight it doesn't just launch modestorm it
3421.74,3426.74, launches directly into the multiplayer thing with the people that you
3426.74,3429.74, were with already there so it's clean nice it's a very clean
3429.74,3433.74, transition I just hope like developers to get it's not like home
3433.74,3437.74, will just figure out like right the games for after we
3437.74,3440.74, design with it so what it is is it hooks you into the multiplayer thing
3440.74,3443.74, then you play in a lobby that's pre populated with the people that you
3443.74,3446.74, were just aware the seemingly all had the modestorm disk in and then when you
3446.74,3450.74, quit out you're back in the house with the people again right
3450.74,3453.74, yeah so I mean it looked a little good and the graphics in how it looked
3453.74,3455.74, like they've been upgraded again it's got like lots of sort of
3455.74,3458.74, bumping back looking things in the environment now and they show you
3458.74,3461.74, can now run it still takes a lot of sort of story to why I was
3461.74,3464.74, I mess around that for like 20 minutes and like you can't run like
3464.74,3466.74, that's right all of the buttons and like it's still a little
3466.74,3469.74, janky as hard like the interface but like it's getting there and it's not
3469.74,3472.74, launching to it's clear they're going to iterate the shit out of this
3472.74,3476.74, thing I mean they show telephoto and like it was actually kind of
3476.74,3479.74, cool because like you didn't really know where like you know
3479.74,3482.74, players were like going with that like he took a picture of the
3482.74,3486.74, kind of Sony X phones that had like the the X-axis on it yeah
3486.74,3488.74, and like he went through it took a picture and then like
3488.74,3491.74, log back into his home and it had been automatically uploaded as
3491.74,3494.74, like a picture on his wall and then from there to pick up
3494.74,3497.74, the it was a new Sony X and it was like this brushed metal
3497.74,3501.74, yeah it was a really damn cool but it had as part of the XMB one of
3501.74,3505.74, the on one of the multimedia tabs in the XMB on the phone was the
3505.74,3508.74, PlayStation Home icon and so it uses his PlayStation network
3508.74,3511.74, login from the phone so it was literally take the picture
3511.74,3514.74, press a button and it and it just connects and it just turned
3514.74,3518.74, up in a frame on the wall I would be laughing so hard if they
3518.74,3522.74, get home integrated with that sort of home anywhere before
3522.74,3525.74, Microsoft does yep it's kind of going through it's an
3525.74,3528.74, that would be awesome leaf up kind of going through the press
3528.74,3530.74, comes order it was like it was like the P.S. and stuff then home
3530.74,3533.74, then they start talking about third party P.S. three games
3533.74,3536.74, yep and that's when they eventually rolled out the new
3536.74,3538.74, middle gear trailer which I'm sure everybody's seen by now
3538.74,3542.74, and as a huge middle gear fan you know the first half of
3542.74,3544.74, it was a little impressed not quite impressed by some of the
3544.74,3547.74, graphics like Marl's hair I've already complained you also have
3547.74,3549.74, a theory about the dialogue yeah I think the dialogue works on
3549.74,3552.74, two levels of me also being allegory about PlayStation
3552.74,3555.74, you go back and watch it again but Marl's hair has been
3555.74,3558.74, addressed when the producer's wait the thing about it's not about
3558.74,3562.74, or anymore the world itself is the economy yeah there's lots
3562.74,3564.74, of going on you got to go back to the idea what's going on but then
3564.74,3567.74, so that was a couple false and really the trailer was not great
3567.74,3571.74, but then it's a crazy the most badass yeah it was a
3571.74,3574.74, time like between realistic but it was just
3574.74,3577.74, right for not being right in and back and it's absurd and it's
3577.74,3580.74, all real time and like to think that if I play as right and I might have
3580.74,3583.74, some of those moves I'm very very sure it worries like pop in
3583.74,3586.74, blades at the bottom of his feet and like kicking and like
3586.74,3589.74, very nice it's like a ton and shoves it for his steps
3589.74,3592.74, yeah steps himself and gets ramp behind right
3592.74,3595.74, goes all Yoshi myths yeah and the good news is you know in a
3595.74,3598.74, week at the twenty th anniversary of middle gear party in Tokyo
3598.74,3601.74, Kojiima is going to finally reveal a playable he's going to play
3601.74,3603.74, it for everybody and Marl and Mark is going to go there and report
3603.74,3606.74, life for us so look forward to that kids and look
3606.74,3611.74, at the game and it was really
3611.74,3614.74, officially early away really so we were blown away by that
3614.74,3616.74, and then they were they started rolling out another bunch of stuff
3616.74,3620.74, and they showed uh... grandems of my five prologue which
3620.74,3625.74, I'm going to say I believe the best graphics in any game ever
3625.74,3628.74, as you we use in some people said oh you know it's pretty close to
3628.74,3632.74, full of no you're the I don't even give it shit about racing
3632.74,3635.74, and I was my job is on the floor during that whole trailer was
3635.74,3637.74, some of those shots were like
3637.74,3640.74, photo of us and I talked to guys working and like that was all
3640.74,3643.74, from the version coming out this November and like the things
3643.74,3646.74, where it's going in a car out of the car you can do that you can
3646.74,3649.74, play with the camera and has full online play inside of the
3649.74,3652.74, cars were in the whole cockpit I told you already that we like when
3652.74,3656.74, we go to TGS that it would nothing would make me happier than
3656.74,3660.74, to be able to go to polyphony and do a real end up
3660.74,3664.74, story on you know what a car not I am I mean I would just I would
3664.74,3668.74, literally give almost anything any show little but they had you know
3668.74,3670.74, that they they showed some external stuff some internal
3670.74,3674.74, stuff and it started off in the pit to the guys working around and then
3674.74,3677.74, it was just the way it was lit and the way the the the the
3677.74,3680.74, the it looks real yeah I mean I didn't expect it I knew it was going
3680.74,3683.74, to make good I didn't expect it to look that good yeah the other
3683.74,3686.74, big announcement was uh... sucker punches game which is called
3686.74,3689.74, infamous yeah right down to his high I thought it was really impressive
3689.74,3692.74, it's basically like a crackdown city heroes kind of doing your hero
3692.74,3695.74, in the light world so the same you know suck upon say a thing in
3695.74,3698.74, okay I have a bit idea in my head of what I'm expecting here
3698.74,3703.74, and it's the greatest knowledge yet you've ever seen it's unbelievable
3703.74,3705.74, Lincoln quote yeah the beginning of the trailer
3705.74,3709.74, the obviously grew a little tired of the yeah they went all the way
3709.74,3711.74, the other way kind of as bad as dude looks kind of like the massive
3711.74,3714.74, guy well I like the idea yeah fast about it later and it's the
3714.74,3717.74, trailer really doesn't give you very good impression of the games like
3717.74,3722.74, you're this super it's like a very much playing on that kind of the
3722.74,3724.74, or someone woke up
3724.74,3727.74, suddenly has powers that are becoming more powerful and you can choose to
3727.74,3730.74, like use them to stop criminals or you can use them to like rob banks
3730.74,3734.74, like they're really embracing the kind of open world concept of like you're
3734.74,3737.74, choosing whether you're good and evil but it was a power so that it was really
3737.74,3740.74, impressively and that it was it was pretty good and as they're running through
3740.74,3743.74, the rest of the first party they're extensive first party line up like
3743.74,3748.74, the party looked great you know having this or again looks great
3748.74,3751.74, a little bit planet I got to play the creation stuff which is really
3751.74,3755.74, fun like it's it's value great the way you're making this incredible
3755.74,3758.74, now so easy to use they should actually create and what they've not
3758.74,3761.74, shown in the past is how you build some of the stuff in the background so
3761.74,3764.74, they showed like building a tank by like drawing drawing it made
3764.74,3767.74, add like these cardboard objects and cutting stuff away then adding
3767.74,3771.74, wheels to it and then suddenly it's it's a 3D object
3771.74,3778.74, like I was playing it and the producer made this giant dragon out of like
3778.74,3781.74, 30 pieces and like once you've made that you can give it to your friends
3781.74,3784.74, so they can have it and put it in their levels too and they did this thing
3784.74,3787.74, where they built the the PlayStation symbols by the solid objects in the
3787.74,3790.74, one that like cut through it to make the symbols and
3790.74,3793.74, I mean it's like one of those like a big like orange block and you're
3793.74,3795.74, sort of a dude dude dude dude dude and there was a huge path through
3795.74,3799.74, the box was just so easy so cool and the producer you say that
3799.74,3803.74, definitely there's going to be a beta this year and the retail product is
3803.74,3807.74, like early next summer and the there's more games from forgetting
3807.74,3810.74, but then kills on was the thing they saved for last and last night
3810.74,3813.74, I got to go see the extended version like the full level like you've seen
3813.74,3815.74, this trailer now clips of that level they play through the entire
3815.74,3819.74, level from beginning to end is about 15 minutes long and I got to
3819.74,3823.74, say I found it very impressive I mean it's it's nothing you haven't
3823.74,3826.74, ever seen before and it is it is shooter they were showing it and like
3826.74,3829.74, I'm thinking you know they were saying because like fill before you showed
3829.74,3832.74, it he was like everything you're about to see is an engine you're like okay
3832.74,3835.74, maybe there's some concessions to it and I know some people that worked
3835.74,3837.74, on it the first that you know when the first trailer came out and
3837.74,3840.74, that technically that was using in game geometry and everything
3840.74,3843.74, but then it dawned on after a while I'm looking because the whole thing
3843.74,3846.74, was these four giant screens and that the first screens
3846.74,3848.74, are running and there were actually two different views of the
3848.74,3850.74, get there was like one of them the trailer was running and then two
3850.74,3853.74, was this real time yeah so damn well and then I didn't notice
3853.74,3856.74, to look up a minute so you could just like I all stayed with the
3856.74,3859.74, pad and he was playing it well so after the demo last night
3859.74,3862.74, where they played the whole level they went back and the beginning
3862.74,3865.74, part where the soldiers are coming into the whole gas planet
3865.74,3868.74, like he paused it and you can move all around you can look at the
3868.74,3872.74, city I mean it's all it's all there it is that level is over two
3872.74,3876.74, gigs of data of graphical data wow I mean it's pretty
3876.74,3879.74, stunning it's very I mean it looks like it's very it's very
3879.74,3882.74, cool a duty it's obviously very fun on you down a gorgeous looking
3882.74,3885.74, path but it's much more cold duty in Halo in the first game but
3885.74,3888.74, really it's that a problem yeah well one thing it's obviously not a
3888.74,3890.74, problem is frame rate because you guys aren't talking about it so
3890.74,3893.74, apparently it was it didn't look as good as CG jailer but I'm not
3893.74,3896.74, disappointed like it looked phenomenal like no one expected the CG
3896.74,3899.74, trailer but people didn't want to look all I mean subtle despite
3899.74,3902.74, through the heart of the first game was the frame rate right
3902.74,3906.74, so I mean as long as they've conquered that mountain then we can look at
3906.74,3909.74, the right then we can really actually run into Alex Ward from the
3909.74,3912.74, from the burnt out team less night he was he he just seen it
3912.74,3915.74, before he went to the Microsoft thing he goes you got to go to check
3915.74,3918.74, out kills on as soon as you possibly can it's unbelievable and he
3918.74,3921.74, was talking about it framing it in context with black because a lot
3921.74,3923.74, of what it does is very similar to black like that's the way the
3923.74,3926.74, environment shatters like there was what there's one fight in the
3926.74,3929.74, demo whether these guys pouring out of this building any standing
3929.74,3932.74, behind a concrete pillar and he has this like really powerful
3932.74,3936.74, machine gun and as he's clipping the concrete it's shattering all
3936.74,3939.74, the way through the rebar the way that blackwood and he said he'd been
3939.74,3942.74, talking to the team about how complex it is to modify geometry and
3942.74,3945.74, stuff like that but he was saying that it's the subtle tears in
3945.74,3949.74, kills own that really make the difference like as you know how good
3949.74,3952.74, the reloads were in kills own one of the most it was just like the
3952.74,3956.74, guns themselves had had real presence chunk or it's the same here
3956.74,3960.74, but as he's like grabbing the gun and popping the clip out and putting it
3960.74,3964.74, back in there's like this focus effects on the gun and most the
3964.74,3968.74, motion was also the gun as he pops it forward and Cox it the gun
3968.74,3972.74, goes out of focus and it just gives like the whole thing so much
3972.74,3975.74, more depth and it's all really subtle stuff and like a lot of
3975.74,3979.74, motion blur but not obnoxious motion blur is just very convincing
3979.74,3982.74, yeah you don't notice it but you appreciate like what it
3982.74,3984.74, adds right well and there's price of level that didn't show
3984.74,3988.74, that later where there's the wind really picks up and there's
3988.74,3992.74, always swaying ropes in the winds like carrying debris and at the end of
3992.74,3995.74, that level you fight these this big a call like an arc tower and it's
3995.74,3998.74, like harnessing the lightning it's pulling all the lightning down and
3998.74,4000.74, you're like trying to destroy this with these other guys are
4000.74,4003.74, shooting you and sounds like it came through something you can't
4003.74,4006.74, don't big time yeah you know sounds like playstation and Sony
4006.74,4009.74, in general came through pretty strong well I think they feel that
4009.74,4012.74, they had to and they like really tried really hard and live it
4012.74,4014.74, some really and it was a broad space it was very different vibe
4014.74,4017.74, from the other team press conferences and I think they were
4017.74,4019.74, somewhat more focused on
4019.74,4022.74, on who they're speaking to yeah there's no they've got to
4022.74,4025.74, wind people over before they I mean they are still banging
4025.74,4028.74, the you know we got to go mainstream drum and I think I still
4028.74,4031.74, think that's a mistake with even with a 500 dollar device I think
4031.74,4034.74, they go a long way to go to to convince of that but the
4034.74,4036.74, games that they showed I mean everything from little big planet
4036.74,4039.74, and some of the quirky download stuff all the way through to
4039.74,4043.74, kill zone there was a lot of stuff to make the audience of it
4043.74,4046.74, all the people right now that are like I'm looking at looking at
4046.74,4049.74, one up at three in the morning and you know and like pop it on
4049.74,4053.74, traffic at weird times and I so any cated that crowd better
4053.74,4056.74, than anybody and as I said you know I took five for things I
4056.74,4058.74, feel they have the best first pro and they so any computer
4058.74,4062.74, team at america is publishing 15 games for ps3 between now and
4062.74,4064.74, the end of the year neither Microsoft no one intended was doing that
4064.74,4067.74, further we got you wrap up john sounds like sounds like you're
4067.74,4070.74, giving Sony a thumbs up yeah yeah that's rude
4070.74,4074.74, patchers up yeah any any other but any wrap up thoughts on it
4074.74,4078.74, I was just I mean everything was actually what I expected and
4078.74,4080.74, hoped for except for an intended like that it was just the big
4080.74,4083.74, disappointment and it's unfortunate and I and like maybe
4083.74,4086.74, though like I don't know when like when are we going to hear about
4086.74,4089.74, their o8 lineup like winning with that happened well they are going to
4089.74,4091.74, teach you as for the first time ever and that's in September all right
4091.74,4094.74, alright we're wrapping up Sony though we're having a Sony
4094.74,4098.74, thumbs up the same as the loan so Sony is my you know Sony
4098.74,4101.74, Microsoft to tender like that's on my conference line same
4101.74,4104.74, I agree completely I think that's the order you can go in Sony
4104.74,4108.74, Microsoft Nintendo and like Sony for me wins just because they had
4108.74,4111.74, more games and they announced more games they surprised me I saw
4111.74,4114.74, things I hadn't seen before which I you know Microsoft they
4114.74,4117.74, showed on that they could have done that they have things to show
4117.74,4120.74, that they're just not show I'm just I can say is I'm smiling
4120.74,4125.74, fully smiling all right next we uh that's it we got we've got this all
4125.74,4128.74, wrapped up done the press conferences we run way longer we intended
4128.74,4131.74, to do so let's just hold the rest of the games we saw and we also
4131.74,4134.74, some other games today we have worked to do that so we have worked on the
4134.74,4136.74, work to do and I got to get some food and because I am like
4136.74,4140.74, I have not had any of you I've got a cookie I've got a cupcake
4140.74,4144.74, so we're going to hit the cupcakes and uh get writing so you guys have
4144.74,4146.74, some more stuff to read I'm going to get this thing process so you can
4146.74,4149.74, listen to it tonight we'll be back tomorrow hopefully
4149.74,4153.74, little earlier with the whole update of games until then we're gone
