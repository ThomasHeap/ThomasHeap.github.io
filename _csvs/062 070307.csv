417.0,421.0, That was the mystery RPG that Darren went to see a couple of weeks ago that.
421.0,423.0, That all but the dumb very dumb people.
424.0,425.0, Yeah.
425.0,426.0, If we wish club them over the head.
426.0,429.0, We're certainly actually used to work fall out in the center.
429.0,431.0, And people continue to debate.
431.0,433.0, And it's got to be ultimate.
433.0,436.0, There was some debate.
436.0,437.0, Yeah.
437.0,438.0, So.
438.0,439.0, Yes.
439.0,442.0, Darren went to Bethesda to see fall three a little while ago with Joe were bicky.

499.0,500.0, July 3rd.
500.0,501.0, To auto assault.
501.0,503.0, May it rest in peace.
503.0,506.0, I'll read the announcement from auto assault.com.
506.0,507.0, I was going to give this loop.
507.0,508.0," I was like, what would it be?"
508.0,512.0, We do tomorrow.
512.0,513.0, I'm like taps.
513.0,515.0," Well, because it's a keynote."
515.0,516.0, It's called vehicular.
516.0,518.0, It's a good car horn.
518.0,520.0, You want to do it behind me?
520.0,521.0," No, but it's got a you don't know."
521.0,522.0, Place taps on the car.
522.0,524.0, You do hear the cuckoo.
524.0,525.0, I got a cuckoo.
525.0,527.0, I got a cuckoo.
527.0,528.0, Yeah.
528.0,529.0, Yeah.
529.0,530.0, Yeah.
530.0,532.0, Cook or I.
532.0,533.0, There's this.
533.0,538.0, This is an announcement that it will be closing down service for auto assault at the end of the summer.
538.0,543.0," The service will close at midnight on August 31st, 2007 as of today."
543.0,544.0," Actually, that was yesterday."
544.0,547.0, It was July 2nd when they announced us as of today.
547.0,548.0, And you play her currently in the service.
548.0,552.0, But the active build account will not be build again.
552.0,553.0," Blah, blah, blah, blah."
553.0,556.0," There will be more announcements coming soon, regarding the shutdown of auto assault."
556.0,558.0, I don't know what more they need to announce.
558.0,559.0, Right.
559.0,560.0, We're still shutting down.
560.0,565.0," I'm going to the donation to donating it to her, you know, it's like a picture of a cat."
565.0,567.0, Don't you donate your car?
567.0,568.0," No, that's not that."
568.0,575.0," That's the news, but my question is, just how badly does your MMO have to fail to actually have it shut down?"
575.0,576.0," I mean, most of the..."
576.0,578.0, How long will that have been?
578.0,579.0, August 30th?
579.0,580.0, It's about a year.
580.0,581.0, About a year.
581.0,583.0," A couple months, who was, I think, April 2006."
583.0,589.0," But think of the MMOs, it still exists that, you know, that completely tanked there are actually still running."
589.0,591.0," Like, Matrix Online for one."
591.0,595.0," And we're only bringing this up because like, those were separated and since it was fun."
595.0,596.0, It was a fun game.
596.0,597.0, It...
597.0,598.0, This is...
598.0,603.0," I still think the combat in the moment to moment gameplay, I had more fun with that than I do with Lord of the Rings Online."
603.0,611.0, I think the big problem for a lot of people was the expectation that this was going to be more of a car wars kind of MMO.
611.0,616.0," Where actually, you know, the driving experience was going to play into the gameplay more."
616.0,620.0," I mean, the fact that you couldn't even really use a steering wheel, I believe, for this game."
620.0,624.0," You know, a lot of people were calling it EQ with a car skin."
624.0,628.0," You know, I mean, there were cars that healed in this game."
628.0,630.0," They weren't just the skin though, you know?"
630.0,633.0," Well, look, you can wrap your head around."
633.0,637.0, Some like douchebag standing on the hill singing to you to heal you.
637.0,639.0, You could fucking heal.
639.0,640.0, You could fuck in hell.
640.0,641.0, I got what cars do.
641.0,642.0, A car that's got like...
642.0,643.0," No, you don't have to."
643.0,644.0," No, you don't have to."
644.0,648.0," You can't even get the car's heal, but in some fantasy universes, barred to do heal."
648.0,649.0, Do you know?
649.0,651.0, In fantasy universe of auto sets.
651.0,652.0," That's real, though."
652.0,653.0, That's all.
653.0,654.0, It's not all.
654.0,656.0," In Night Rider, a car could fix itself."
656.0,657.0," That was real, right?"
657.0,659.0," Damn it, you got me."
659.0,660.0," Just an nights, everyone."
660.0,661.0, There's people in the night.
661.0,662.0, There's people in the night.
662.0,665.0, You can get out of your cars at various points in the game.
665.0,666.0, Yeah.
666.0,667.0, But you don't care.
667.0,668.0, It's just like...
668.0,669.0, And neither did any gamers.
669.0,670.0, I can't.
670.0,672.0," Like, you know, the general, like..."
672.0,673.0, You know what we're just talking about.
673.0,676.0," The general thing of like, instead of, you know, mining and stuff."
676.0,680.0, It's more fun to like run through a settlement with a bunch of fools running around
680.0,683.0, and just run through their shitty housing.
683.0,684.0, That might be a good plan.
684.0,686.0, Because there's no one else playing it.
686.0,688.0, It might have just been like a co-op game.
688.0,691.0," It was me and my friend Roya, we were always just going in there."
691.0,693.0," And from the first week that we were playing it,"
693.0,698.0," we were already talking about like, you know, the end of the world since door for us all."
698.0,700.0," And, you know, the wastelands and how long."
700.0,703.0, And people were already the very first week that it came out.
703.0,706.0," People were asking, I wonder if they're going to compost toward TABYLAROSO."
706.0,708.0, I wonder if they're going to compost toward whatever.
708.0,709.0," It was like, what's going to happen?"
709.0,710.0, Because I paid three months.
710.0,712.0, But they were worried because I paid for three months.
712.0,713.0, This is a description.
713.0,714.0, It was going to last for three months.
714.0,715.0, That was a year ago.
715.0,716.0, Right.
716.0,717.0, That's sad.
717.0,720.0, How long was it before they condensed all the servers into one?
720.0,722.0," Oh, that wasn't that much pretty fast."
722.0,723.0, It's just amazing to me.
723.0,725.0," They don't even have enough to make it, you know,"
725.0,729.0, to justify just keeping the servers to keep one server running.
729.0,732.0," There's rumors now that maybe, and they're just rumors."
732.0,738.0, So this has no basis in any fact that like the net devil or someone will pick it up.
738.0,741.0, And just run a server for those dedicated fans.
741.0,745.0," Or do they or someone else find a shard opener, so they're maybe fancy soft."
745.0,746.0, It's not worth it.
746.0,747.0, Yeah.
747.0,750.0, But maybe net devil that developers or someone else can pick it up and just run it.
750.0,751.0, It's a cut-through business.
751.0,754.0," That's why when you're talking about, you know, the agency recently announced this,"
754.0,756.0, so we MMO with this bi-themed.
756.0,761.0," It's like, if it already proven fun and cool game couldn't succeed,"
761.0,768.0, it's just people don't want anything but the damn singing at the people that are fighting.
768.0,772.0," I think part of the, I mean, like, this is a part of a larger thing."
772.0,776.0," I mean, maybe people weren't ready and are they ready yet for an action MMO?"
776.0,780.0," I mean, it's something we have monthly fee for is what it comes down to."
780.0,784.0," It's going to take someone to make a great one, like a great developer making a great one."
784.0,788.0," I mean, it's going to take a shitty developer making a shitty one."
788.0,790.0, I'm not way to take a stand.
790.0,791.0," Yeah, way to take a stand."
791.0,792.0, What does John run?
792.0,798.0," He's a good game from a good developer, but you know what I mean, like I hear you as an analyst."
798.0,804.0," In my expert opinion, I mean, it's going to take like a blizzard level developer to just say,"
804.0,805.0," okay, fuck this shit."
805.0,807.0, We're going to make one that actually works.
807.0,809.0, That looks great.
809.0,813.0," That runs on, you know, on, on, not on the high sense."
813.0,816.0, Just on like a Vanguard type thing.
816.0,820.0," That didn't, I don't know, so it doesn't need to run onto high end of a system."
820.0,822.0, I think it was just needed players.
822.0,824.0, It just needs to be needed players.
824.0,830.0," Well, I think if they kind of drop the whole notion of a monthly fee or have, like, you know, paid for, like, unique content,"
830.0,835.0," they might have gotten some more people into it, because that's the model that seems to work in Asia."
835.0,836.0," Yeah, it's a workshop."
836.0,837.0, I don't know.
837.0,842.0," I don't think even a good, even a good, I mean, because, like I already said, the quality was,"
842.0,843.0, was fine on this.
843.0,845.0," Yeah, it had a great time playing it."
845.0,846.0, I just don't think that matter.
846.0,848.0, There's just some like mysterious variable.
848.0,852.0," It's like it's just not elves, not people don't want it."
852.0,856.0," But now that we know the niche, the answer mode is I wanted to quest with cars."
856.0,859.0, Just to get two audiences that don't cross over very much.
859.0,860.0, Maybe.
860.0,863.0," Because I like for me, I'm just like, yeah, cars."
863.0,866.0," I mean, the like, I like, more trials could have helped, because I wasn't,"
866.0,867.0, definitely.
867.0,870.0," I wasn't like, oh shit, you know, I get to, I get to be a car."
870.0,872.0, I'm going to get me some of this.
872.0,874.0," It was like, I had the game for free."
874.0,876.0," So I was like, oh, I'll try it."
876.0,878.0," And that's when I was like, this is actually pretty cool."
878.0,881.0," I think they have the problem with people even, you know, going to get it."
881.0,884.0," So my name is, I'm going to call it a three-posted, you know, your games in trouble,"
884.0,887.0, even the collectors edition is selling for $5.
887.0,889.0, That's at EB games.
889.0,895.0, Now that we know the date and the hour of the world.
895.0,896.0," Oh, true."
896.0,897.0, I want to get it there.
897.0,898.0, Let's get it in.
898.0,899.0, Let's get it in there and do like.
899.0,900.0, Rev our engines.
900.0,901.0, What do you mean?
901.0,904.0," But it's like, you know, it's right off into the sunset."
904.0,906.0, 20 minutes to zero hour.
906.0,910.0," You go in there and just start saying, like, hey, I've been waiting to get this."
910.0,911.0, I haven't had money.
911.0,912.0, I just got it.
912.0,913.0, Half-race books.
913.0,914.0, They had it for two.
914.0,915.0," Like, just like, what do I do?"
915.0,916.0, What do I do?
916.0,917.0, That's awesome.
917.0,922.0," It just go around, you know, like, just, I can see myself spending a lot of time in this mother fucker."
922.0,925.0, Hooking up and let them tell you.
925.0,927.0, Let them tell you the sky's falling.
927.0,928.0," And they just say, what are you guys role players?"
928.0,929.0, They've been shut up.
929.0,931.0, They all parked on this cliff looking at the sunset.
931.0,935.0," Yeah, so you know, excuse me, we should be going to go sailing off the cliff."
935.0,937.0, We just die in the game style.
937.0,939.0," It pull it as we're, yeah, freeze framed in it."
939.0,943.0, It is a rare moment that you don't really see very often is the end of a world.
943.0,944.0, Right.
944.0,945.0," Like Ashron's called, too, right?"
945.0,946.0, So it's the last one.
946.0,947.0, Yeah.
947.0,948.0, Right.
948.0,950.0, So I say close to the amount you just try to mobilize as many listeners as possible to just
950.0,952.0," join us on the server and just kind of like, right."
952.0,953.0, Stear at the sunset.
953.0,954.0, It'll cause you five bucks apparently.
954.0,955.0, Right.
955.0,956.0, So I'm really in the solvenity.
956.0,957.0, We're not going to stop it now.
957.0,958.0, Yeah.
958.0,961.0," Well, because be there live online for the auto-solid funeral."
961.0,968.0," With conduct our podcast live in in California, the death of auto-solid."
968.0,970.0, We're going out and then it just is.
970.0,971.0, I pull the plug on our shit.
971.0,974.0, So we have one was that August 31st.
974.0,976.0, Mark of the Calators.
976.0,980.0, I guess who is the first to midnight midnight what?
980.0,981.0, Pacific.
981.0,982.0," Well, we'll check."
982.0,983.0," Yeah, that's an important point."
984.0,986.0," Oh, we got a little bit of time to get this."
986.0,988.0, We all need to activate our accounts.
988.0,991.0, Us here in the studio and all you listening.
991.0,992.0, Okay.
992.0,993.0, So we'll do that.
993.0,994.0, All right.
994.0,995.0, We'll now are back on the exact time.
995.0,997.0, So what are we playing at the moment?
997.0,1000.0, We know what we're playing at the end of the month.
1000.0,1001.0, Sun the Roy.
1001.0,1002.0, Started playing.
1002.0,1004.0, And I'm going to be territory quick or a bit.
1004.0,1007.0," Not to the extent you've played it, but I started."
1007.0,1008.0, Okay.
1008.0,1009.0, I was digging it.
1009.0,1010.0, It is a start.
1010.0,1012.0, What you Jeff.
1012.0,1012.5, Me too.
1012.5,1013.5, Yeah.
1013.5,1015.5, We can merge into that conversation.
1015.5,1016.5, What do you guys think?
1016.5,1018.5, Just just turned it on.
1018.5,1019.5," No, I played around."
1019.5,1021.5, I may as most have played around with the soldier classes.
1021.5,1025.5," Like the pretty basic ones, even though like the ones I know I will probably end up playing"
1025.5,1027.5, or the engineering types.
1027.5,1028.5, Yeah.
1028.5,1029.5, It's supposed to be a separate.
1029.5,1030.5," Yeah, I'd rather do this."
1030.5,1032.5, Even like watching other mostly I did.
1032.5,1036.5, So like I wouldn't be asked to do things and not know how to do them.
1036.5,1038.5, So I wanted to kind of get a feel for like what?
1038.5,1039.5," No, no."
1039.5,1040.5, You did do 80.
1040.5,1041.5," No, I did."
1041.5,1042.5, It's quickly what happened.
1042.5,1045.5," Getting the having the good luck of being on the team that knows what they're doing,"
1045.5,1049.5," especially if you're on strong, which is not always that way, but in the map sewer that's"
1049.5,1054.5, available on the beta and the stronger on defense and the defending team always has to have
1054.5,1056.5, players that have their shit together.
1056.5,1057.5, Right.
1057.5,1058.5, Just get rolled.
1058.5,1059.5, It'll be back to the loading screen in like no time.
1059.5,1062.5, And it does seem at least the server is I was on that.
1062.5,1067.5," Yeah, at this point in the beta, there weren't enough people knowing exactly what to do."
1067.5,1068.5, That is just the server you got.
1069.5,1070.5, Because there are already plans.
1070.5,1073.5, There are totally plans in there with their tags and you'll run into the entire group.
1073.5,1077.5," It seems like when you're on those servers, that's going to be super fun when people know their"
1077.5,1078.5, roles and we're using them.
1078.5,1084.5," As long as I mean shit, even the first phase, if the straw get least have a few engineers,"
1084.5,1087.5," yeah, although they're not called in your calls, that's your strategy."
1087.5,1091.5," Those and you get at least, you know, one anti-personel,"
1091.5,1096.5," turn up a one anti-vacal turn up and then your laser shield to protect your,"
1096.5,1101.5," where the area where they're trying to build the EMP disruptor, if you could protect yourself from"
1101.5,1103.5, artillery strikes and stuff.
1103.5,1104.5, And you get that up.
1104.5,1108.5, And then the three that do that as long as you're smart enough to at least repair them now and then
1108.5,1109.5, for one another.
1109.5,1110.5, Right.
1110.5,1113.5," Then you can, you could do a big delaying action just at that point."
1113.5,1118.5, But what happens a lot of time is you'll lose that because no one did anything.
1118.5,1123.5," And then when they're, you know, you're working on defending the sewer grates and then ultimately the sewer controls."
1123.5,1125.5, You still have guys out in the field doing whatever.
1125.5,1128.5," I'm going to go up into the mountain right on the Echris and hop around,"
1128.5,1130.5, maybe I could snip someone.
1130.5,1135.5," It's like every, meanwhile, everyone on GF is like busting through your crap and blow in the gates out."
1135.5,1136.5, Right.
1136.5,1141.5," Actually, I couldn't figure out how to spawn into the body of someone else."
1141.5,1145.5," Is that like a, you press an option when you just press F, it has to be converted."
1146.5,1152.5," What happens is the equivalent of the technician, the equivalent of the strong, the medic will go and turn the body."
1152.5,1154.5," Yeah, I have seen the body isn't, like, it's been happening."
1154.5,1162.5," So when it's there, it'll also appear on your map with an on-guidcon and it'll, you'll hear an audio cue saying, you know, corpse spawn host available."
1162.5,1163.5, Right.
1163.5,1170.5," So you go up to it, just look at it and press F. Now it'll then either cue it up and you'll see an icon in the bottom of your right hand corner of your screen."
1170.5,1173.5, Or it'll say spawn host already claimed.
1173.5,1176.5," And that means someone else got to it first, so you go find yourself."
1176.5,1178.5," Okay, there was one person, maybe that was just, just going on there."
1178.5,1182.5," There's a kind of stuff that, like, that's why I was trying to pick most basic class, because there's just so many ones."
1182.5,1184.5," Yeah, there's a big learning curve in this game."
1184.5,1190.5," I mean, really, it took, I was dorking around in the, but when you Sean came over and sort of walked me through a couple of the classes,"
1190.5,1192.5, that made a big difference.
1192.5,1196.5," But, you know, the average gamer is not going to have Sean Elliott standing behind them,"
1196.5,1198.5, giving them a tutorial of the game.
1198.5,1200.5," Yeah, you know, they're really with a lot to learn in that."
1200.5,1206.5," Yeah, but you could just go through your kit first, you know, I mean, especially Sean starts soldier class, which is basic."
1206.5,1211.5," Well, right, entirely self-explanatory with maybe possible exception of the charred plasma charges."
1211.5,1216.5, I just hope that the actual retail game has a good tutorial where they walk people through these classes.
1216.5,1217.5," Well, that's a problem."
1217.5,1220.5," As I've been understanding from the very beginning, they're going to, like, kind of like,"
1220.5,1225.5, the server is going to kind of tell you give you class sensitive tips.
1225.5,1228.5," So it kind of, it's slowly kind of ramp up and introduce you to all the concepts."
1228.5,1230.5," Actually, it does a little on the game."
1230.5,1231.5, It's a prize.
1231.5,1234.5," How general those are and how, like, say, the difference is in battlefield,"
1234.5,1237.5," we call the guy, Grandpa with her spoon."
1237.5,1240.5," And that's the old man who does the audio tool tips, you know,"
1240.5,1242.5," and in that game, those are better."
1242.5,1243.5, Yeah.
1243.5,1246.5," But we start despising with, like, you know, every time we, we,"
1246.5,1250.5," we relieve the race the game and reinstall it on another computer,"
1250.5,1252.5, just because I need to space my hard drive in it.
1252.5,1254.5," And a grandpa would come back and I'm like, dude, I've got, like, at this point, I got, like,"
1254.5,1256.5," at this point, I got like, 900 hours in the game."
1256.5,1258.5, I don't need you fucking old ass telling me how to get the game.
1258.5,1259.5, Yeah.
1259.5,1260.5, It's so funny.
1260.5,1263.5," And then we realize when we're playing, uh,"
1263.5,1266.5," Quake Wars, I got in the tormentor, it's a strong flyer."
1266.5,1269.5," And I found out that you have, they call it a top hat control,"
1269.5,1272.5," where you're able to hold a button and you can, even if you're the pilot,"
1272.5,1276.5," you can, uh, then independently move your crosshairs for your rockets,"
1276.5,1279.5," and then in addition that has countermeasures and either of which,"
1279.5,1281.5," I had no idea, you know,"
1282.5,1286.5," and, uh, so it's like, dude, we could use old grandpa with a spoon after all, you know?"
1286.5,1288.5," Yeah, I actually couldn't believe I was one."
1288.5,1291.5," Yeah, yeah, there's not really enough explanation."
1291.5,1292.5, It's a better.
1292.5,1293.5," Yeah, yeah."
1293.5,1296.5, There just needs to be more information given to new players to it.
1296.5,1297.5, Right.
1297.5,1298.5, Because those roles are so crucial.
1298.5,1300.5," This isn't, it's so not random."
1300.5,1301.5," I mean, you got it."
1301.5,1304.5, You need everybody on that team to get these goals done.
1304.5,1308.5," However, I think it is a game where you can, um,"
1309.5,1312.5," and this will actually tie a nicely to the other game I mentioned, hyperbowl,"
1312.5,1315.5," but, uh, it's the kind of game where even if you're not familiar with it,"
1315.5,1319.5," you can just jump in and, and you'll still, you'll still get some kills because you're like,"
1319.5,1323.5," hey, I know what a rail gun is and I know what you do with it and yeah,"
1323.5,1325.5," like I'm still doing something, where it's like,"
1325.5,1326.5," hyperbowl, what you don't talk about,"
1326.5,1332.5," thoroughly right now, but is entirely new in concept and execution and all this stuff."
1332.5,1335.5," And it's kind of intimidating when I'm like, hey, do I want to go play this right now?"
1335.5,1337.5," Or do I want to just play Quake Wars and say, well,"
1337.5,1341.5, I expect to go into hyperbowl and just get my ass handed to me and have it be confusing and
1341.5,1346.5," maybe I need to go practice more, but like Quake, like, even even if I don't know"
1346.5,1350.5," every, you know, nuance and subtlety, I can still get the tank and I know that if I can"
1350.5,1352.5," show on someone, it's going to be totally right."
1352.5,1357.5," What I liked about being the constructor and I really got into it after you showed me how to do it was,"
1357.5,1363.5," uh, you know, not, not just that I was getting to do things like build things,"
1363.5,1369.5," but that those actions will first of all that they were counting towards the mission goals,"
1369.5,1372.5," which is cool like you're saying or they helped, they helped win the mission goals."
1372.5,1374.5, They get a huge XP too.
1374.5,1377.5," But also, you're right, and I was getting my frag count was going up,"
1377.5,1380.5," I was like, wow, this is like camping because I would build a turret."
1380.5,1381.5, You don't have to be there.
1381.5,1385.5," I could build a turret in a remote, in a sort of, you know, intelligent place where people"
1385.5,1386.5, couldn't see it right away.
1386.5,1389.5," And when you're getting, and when people are trying to track you repair it, you know, you"
1389.5,1390.5, can't repair your friends.
1390.5,1396.5," So you can have, I mean, in fact, the top scoring people are usually one of the specialist classes,"
1396.5,1401.5," not the soldiers, you know, because it's, you know, like even if you build the defense barrier,"
1401.5,1405.5," every time that's stopping, you know, an individual, you know, rocket or, you know, artillery,"
1405.5,1408.5, anything you're getting XP for every single one of those right.
1408.5,1412.5," Yeah, they did a really nice job of, I, and I don't know if this is true or not,"
1412.5,1417.5," because I didn't play battlefield enough and when I did play it, I'm talking about the original 42."
1417.5,1423.5," I always wanted to just be like a foot soldier, but like, I never was that inspired to want to be like a medic or the"
1423.5,1428.5," super class, because I didn't want to just like be support, like just be helping the other people who"
1428.5,1430.5, are actually playing the game.
1430.5,1431.5, Yeah.
1431.5,1432.5, That's what it felt like to me.
1432.5,1433.5, Even if that's not true.
1433.5,1434.5, Where does it get that impression?
1434.5,1437.5," Well, in clay course, I don't at all, because it seems like the roles are more, and they"
1437.5,1439.5, know that from the beginning.
1439.5,1443.5," They're like the whole, you know, mission statement, you know, we talked to Paul Wedgewood, you know,"
1443.5,1449.5," from splash damage and stuff, is that you can only trust people's motivation to be selfish."
1449.5,1453.5," So if you ever want someone to do something that's all trueistic, you have to ultimately"
1453.5,1455.5," hang yourself, just motivation to it."
1455.5,1460.5," So medic, hey, you're the first one to plant, you make a spawn house, you're going to be the first one to take it."
1460.5,1463.5," The other ones that you get XP from are for the rest of the team, right?"
1463.5,1467.5," An engineer, I'm doing this so I can get a shitload of XP from myself."
1467.5,1472.5," And so, you know, and the kids good nonetheless, the nail guns great, it comes with the other, you know,"
1472.5,1476.5," it's still a good class to heal yourself, rearm yourself."
1476.5,1483.5," And that's why there's no commander too, you know, it's like there, just like, just everyone count, I mean, it's just a given."
1483.5,1486.5," We've watched other, you know, this is speaking from their point of view."
1486.5,1492.5, We've watched other games try it and try to assume that outside of a clan and an artificial clan environment where you've got people
1492.5,1497.5," designated roles, people will act in the interest of everyone on their team, but they don't."
1497.5,1503.5," Like if we want that, we got to find a way to incentivize it by incentivizing individual actions that ultimately help the team."
1503.5,1505.5, I think that's working really well.
1505.5,1506.5," Yeah, absolutely smart."
1506.5,1514.5," Yeah, I mean, so far, I'd say we have universal positive impressions here at GFW for now we just make more maps because me more maps."
1514.5,1515.5," Yeah, I think so."
1515.5,1518.5, I think so many hours on that already.
1518.5,1519.5," So it's just sewer, right?"
1519.5,1521.5, Or it's all there's a sewer.
1521.5,1522.5," Yeah, thank you, sewer."
1522.5,1523.5, Yeah.
1523.5,1524.5, But it's a good start.
1524.5,1525.5, Real good start.
1525.5,1526.5, Yeah.
1527.5,1528.5, Thumbs up.
1528.5,1533.5," Hey, do you want to segue into a hyper ball?"
1533.5,1535.5, I can do that real quick and then we'll go to fa.
1535.5,1536.5, Okay.
1536.5,1538.5, I'm going to actually do want to throw in one game.
1538.5,1539.5," Okay, okay."
1539.5,1541.5," Point about stuff, but you do have a ball."
1541.5,1542.5, He'll hit it.
1542.5,1543.5, So what's your answer?
1543.5,1544.5," Okay, final hit."
1544.5,1546.5," Another kind of ball, baseball."
1546.5,1551.5, So I was reading as soon as I saw some piece of PC sports story and I got to think about this.
1551.5,1552.5," So I'm like, where the hell is there?"
1553.5,1557.5," Okay, we used to like, in the office, even before my time, there was like, everyone was playing high-heat baseball."
1557.5,1559.5, They were tournaments in the office.
1559.5,1561.5," And I was just like wondering,"
1561.5,1564.5, Why the hell isn't there a baseball game for the PC?
1564.5,1565.5, And I saw it.
1565.5,1567.5," So I just, I was hanging out with the body."
1567.5,1569.5, I was playing the biggest on the consoles.
1569.5,1571.5, That's a really good baseball game.
1571.5,1572.5, And you know what?
1572.5,1574.5," I don't know if this is, I think Zigg mentioned this in the story."
1574.5,1578.5, There's rumors that two K might be bringing that back to the PC at some point.
1578.5,1580.5," Part of it, you think you answered your own question though."
1580.5,1582.5, You're hanging out with the body and playing the bigs.
1582.5,1584.5, That's like a perfect console.
1584.5,1585.5," Yeah, you're experienced."
1585.5,1587.5," But you know, it's so, it's so, it's, you know, in a sense, so it's why he baseball."
1587.5,1589.5, And those are PC games.
1589.5,1590.5, Trying to imagine that.
1590.5,1592.5," He's playing it around like, let me up."
1592.5,1593.5, Let me up.
1593.5,1594.5, I'm playing that.
1594.5,1595.5," That's never tournament's here, right?"
1595.5,1596.5," No, it wasn't even that way."
1596.5,1597.5, Just sitting in front of the same computer.
1597.5,1600.5, I thought the bigs was like the herbs or something.
1600.5,1602.5, I thought I was some random sim game.
1602.5,1603.5, Yeah.
1603.5,1604.5, What is this baseball?
1604.5,1608.5," But I guess I'm just like, I guess when I started playing that this past weekend,"
1608.5,1609.5," I was thinking myself, damn it."
1609.5,1612.5," Why, why, why are all the good sports games?"
1612.5,1615.5," And like, and like, and it got me, that's what we had in that story."
1615.5,1616.5, Exactly.
1616.5,1617.5, We've been playing that.
1617.5,1618.5, And that's what I'm saying.
1618.5,1619.5," I mean, like, as I was reading like, is it a good story?"
1619.5,1620.5," I'm like, God damn it."
1620.5,1621.5, He's right.
1621.5,1623.5, I want to see some of this shit back on the PC.
1623.5,1624.5, Yeah.
1624.5,1625.5," So, good to see."
1625.5,1626.5, Yeah.
1626.5,1629.5, Baseball's like one of the games that seems like for sports.
1629.5,1631.5, Does make sense on the PC.
1631.5,1633.5," Like, especially if you're not playing it as an action game."
1633.5,1638.5," Are you doing it as like a, you know, a baseball management sim or something?"
1638.5,1639.5, Yeah.
1639.5,1640.5, And those games do exist.
1640.5,1641.5, Yeah.
1641.5,1642.5, But I don't want to play a freaking sim.
1642.5,1644.5, I don't care about like all the dirty stats.
1644.5,1646.5," I mean, I want to be able to like swing a batter stuff, too."
1646.5,1647.5," Well, that's what your Xbox is."
1647.5,1648.5, Guess I'm going to a console.
1648.5,1649.5, All right.
1649.5,1650.5, You've got that.
1650.5,1651.5, So you're we as for this.
1651.5,1652.5, MMO baseball.
1652.5,1653.5, You know what I mean?
1653.5,1654.5, That's the other.
1654.5,1655.5, Yeah.
1655.5,1656.5, A baseball online.
1656.5,1657.5, And just yeah.
1657.5,1660.5, I'm just going to sense that every person on your team is controlled by the player.
1660.5,1661.5, Yeah.
1661.5,1663.5," I mean, they baseball that means a lot of time in the box."
1663.5,1664.5, Yeah.
1664.5,1665.5, Yeah.
1665.5,1666.5, I don't understand about that baseball online.
1666.5,1667.5, Yeah.
1667.5,1669.5," Frankly, I really want to see."
1669.5,1670.5, I really want to see.
1670.5,1671.5, It's been a moment.
1671.5,1673.5," I mean, 90% of the game is just bullshit with people."
1673.5,1674.5, So it doesn't matter.
1674.5,1675.5, So you got to be sitting at there.
1675.5,1676.5, I feel exactly.
1676.5,1677.5, I feel exactly.
1677.5,1678.5, I was right.
1678.5,1679.5, I was going out there.
1679.5,1680.5, Green.
1680.5,1681.5, I'm going to count those blades.
1681.5,1682.5, You guys.
1682.5,1683.5, You family got last night.
1683.5,1686.5, But he count those blades of grass.
1686.5,1687.5, So the field.
1687.5,1688.5, Yeah.
1689.5,1691.5, It would have just have like the normal like sports debate.
1691.5,1692.5, You'd already be having.
1692.5,1693.5, Yeah.
1693.5,1695.5," Normally, don't pay $50 a month."
1695.5,1696.5, He's sitting in right field.
1696.5,1697.5, That's a.
1697.5,1700.5, I'd be wondering if I'd subscribe to money with going in the thumbs.
1700.5,1702.5, I don't think I don't think I was a free.
1702.5,1703.5, I don't know how that makes.
1703.5,1705.5, Because no one's going to pay $50 a month.
1705.5,1706.5, I don't know how to say that.
1706.5,1707.5, The last.
1707.5,1708.5, That in our last baseball.
1708.5,1711.5, It was a timey little sort of for my genesis.
1711.5,1712.5," Oh, shit."
1712.5,1714.5, It tells you how much I just got to think about it.
1714.5,1717.5, I just got to think about it.
1717.5,1720.5, Because it's like the all start games in San Francisco next week.
1720.5,1721.5, And all that.
1721.5,1722.5," Anyway, so that was it."
1722.5,1723.5, It's weird.
1723.5,1726.5, Those games like the quick trying to derail too much.
1726.5,1727.5, But like Tommy the sword.
1727.5,1728.5, I used to play that.
1728.5,1730.5, But I was thinking like up until.
1730.5,1733.5," PlayStation 2, I'd even play Madden and I'd get all the sports games."
1733.5,1736.5," And eventually it was like, but I've never really been into them."
1736.5,1738.5," To in the real sports, you know, right."
1738.5,1740.5, There's more fun playing.
1740.5,1741.5, I know the Madden games too.
1741.5,1745.5," But it's interesting because, you know, when it was like Tommy the sword or when it was just called like"
1745.5,1749.5," baseball or soccer for Nintendo or something, they're really like anyone can get."
1749.5,1750.5," Let's just get it and play it, you know."
1750.5,1752.5," And for some reason, it's just seem accessible."
1752.5,1753.5, Yeah.
1753.5,1757.5," This is, it doesn't matter if I'm, you know, following the stats of every player play fantasy baseball."
1757.5,1761.5, I can just get in and then fuck with everyone by playing pickle on every single time I.
1761.5,1764.5," You know, even in baseball, you're grieving."
1764.5,1767.5, That's how I always play like that game.
1767.5,1769.5, It was just all I would just be all about playing pickle.
1769.5,1771.5, Is there any game that you haven't greafed in?
1771.5,1773.5, I'd be kind of probably not.
1773.5,1776.5," No, but it was like in nowadays, it's like it just gets in timid."
1776.5,1781.5," There's like a billion different, you know, catch phrases for the types of passing and every other thing."
1781.5,1787.5," And then I'm like, eh, it's probably, you know, I was wondering, I was like, why haven't I picked up Madden in so long now?"
1787.5,1788.5, I haven't been different as generation.
1788.5,1793.5," I was like, I guess like at that point, the better and the higher fidelity at some points."
1793.5,1797.5," It's just like, it just seems like it's more just for the specialists."
1797.5,1802.5," You know, I actually have a monster playing football and I'll be into it."
1802.5,1804.5, How about Mario golf?
1804.5,1805.5," Dude, he Mario golf."
1805.5,1806.5, I think we have this decision.
1806.5,1807.5," Yeah, we have."
1807.5,1808.5," Yeah, we have golf rules."
1808.5,1810.5, You want like muting league football or something?
1810.5,1811.5, Yeah.
1811.5,1812.5, Nice.
1812.5,1813.5, Think we're retracing the club territory.
1813.5,1814.5," Anyway, okay, sorry."
1814.5,1815.5, There's a problem with that.
1815.5,1819.5," I could reset here because I messed it up on the, we were taping something on the,"
1819.5,1821.5," I don't want to, one up show segment."
1821.5,1827.5," And I was trying to say that like it's impossible to find an entendow fan who's disappointed because, you know, the argument was like,"
1827.5,1834.5," well, can, uh, entendow, I mean, what are they going to do to keep their fans happy and stuff, whatever, you know?"
1834.5,1840.5," That's like, there's no, there's no way to, uh, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to point and entendow fan."
1840.5,1845.5," It's kind of like taking your mom to crispy cream and like finding a donut that she's not going to eat, you know,"
1845.5,1848.5," and anyway, that's what it was and I messed it up there."
1848.5,1851.5," I don't think it, my mom doesn't like donuts."
1851.5,1852.5, It's a piece of dough.
1852.5,1855.5," Yeah, my mom don't wear purple, sorry."
1856.5,1857.5, Not bow.
1857.5,1859.5, I've removed.
1859.5,1860.5, I've removed.
1860.5,1861.5, I've removed.
1861.5,1863.5," Is, uh, never bowl or, I've removed."
1863.5,1868.5," It's, uh, BOL, BOL, BOL, like, you, like, Uwe, BOL, O.ow."
1868.5,1872.5," So, and what's the, what's the, full name of the game, Ryan?"
1872.5,1873.5, It's ridiculous.
1873.5,1875.5," Something threats, threats, face colon, hyperbowl."
1875.5,1880.5," Threadspace, I think is the, uh, no, that's, that's actually the name of the game."
1880.5,1881.5," Yeah, I think."
1881.5,1886.5," But anyway, it's four guys, uh, Atari, Atari is going to publish it, but there's a free stress test beta out now."
1886.5,1888.5, And you get it through steam.
1888.5,1890.5," You can find it just by, you know, putting hyperbowl."
1890.5,1895.5," That's, you know, with the BOLs we explain in your search engine and you'll find it right away."
1895.5,1899.5," But the reason you want to check, uh, check this game out is because,"
1899.5,1906.5," if you like, you know, some of the very best stuff about what's the group that makes uplinked our Wynia version."
1906.5,1909.5," Interversion, you know, like, if you like their stuff, it's kind of got that vibe,"
1909.5,1916.5," but the thing about this game is you're basically a spaceship on, you know, on a small panel and"
1916.5,1925.5," other players come in and they have a spaceship and then they can create, uh, this extra little satellite that helps them generate additional weapons and things like that."
1925.5,1928.5, Then it might be structured as like a maze or something with turrets.
1928.5,1929.5, And so think really simple.
1929.5,1931.5," It would be like an Xbox live game, right?"
1931.5,1932.5, Okay.
1932.5,1935.5," But then from there, it, it really, it's hard to describe."
1935.5,1941.5," I mean, similar to worms, people want to make the comparison to worms in that so much if it's about the randomness of,"
1941.5,1943.5," okay, the wind is going like forward, not to this direction."
1943.5,1948.5," What's going to happen when I shoot a rocket at this angle, you know, so you're able to actually, you know,"
1948.5,1952.5," hook things around and hit, uh, targets that you don't have a line of sight on."
1952.5,1956.5," So you have all these weapons and you can apply spin and curve to them, you know,"
1956.5,1961.5," or at any point in their trajectory, you know, say shoot a rocket and then you put like 40% right curve on it and then you,"
1961.5,1964.5," like, activate that after it's been flying for a few feet."
1964.5,1967.5, And you're trying to basically get around defenses and hit another player.
1967.5,1976.5," Then it gets really insane because you have, you know, all these other other weapons and powers that you use."
1976.5,1978.5, So you can create a vortex somewhere.
1978.5,1981.5, And then that's going to maybe absorb shots or spin them off in another direction.
1981.5,1987.5," You have things that will blow up and then apply additional, like, kinetic force to whatever they hit."
1987.5,1989.5, So say someone keeps trying to hit you with nukes.
1989.5,1993.5, Then you blow that up and you can send it often another direction to hit another player.
1993.5,1997.5," And then people are really, and this happens real time instead of like, you know,"
1997.5,2001.5," so imagine if you're playing worms in real time, but you even had like, it doesn't more options than"
2001.5,2006.5, are there and then there's a lot more skill based stuff where you're setting up a reflective walls and
2006.5,2012.5," rigging crap up there, moving your ship now and then do a void fire doing offensive and defensive stuff."
2012.5,2014.5, But you really should check it out.
2014.5,2018.5," I'm just seeing, you know, it's difficult to explain sounds like worms for nerds."
2018.5,2021.5," But no, it's, it was worms."
2021.5,2022.5, You got me there.
2022.5,2024.5," No, but it's, it's pretty cool."
2024.5,2026.5," I definitely, you should definitely check it out."
2026.5,2027.5, It's intimidating.
2027.5,2028.5, It's got an excellent tutorial though.
2028.5,2029.5, It'll walk you through everything.
2029.5,2030.5, Really?
2030.5,2031.5, Okay.
2031.5,2032.5," But when you go online, it's just there."
2032.5,2035.5," Some people that will be pulling off some amazing, you know, it's like,"
2035.5,2036.5, a quick little pool sharks.
2036.5,2040.5," You know, people are just pulling off amazing ricochets and they got the trajectories"
2040.5,2041.5, worked out and it's cool.
2041.5,2045.5, Really good and two to grasp for where the shots are going to be placed.
2045.5,2047.5," But yeah, that's definitely, that's kind of the whole."
2047.5,2053.5," In my, my gaming spectrum right now is the little, the little Darwinian kind of game."
2053.5,2054.5, Yeah.
2054.5,2055.5, I think you like it.
2055.5,2059.5," And again, playing it, I always get mad and going this exact same, you know,"
2059.5,2063.5," rant, but in the, in our offices, you know, outside of us, you know,"
2063.5,2067.5," there's all these people who just love and champion this kind of game, you know,"
2067.5,2071.5, our McDonald's always talking with the latest thing on Xbox Live run on the PS3 network.
2071.5,2073.5," And I see him playing all these things and it's like,"
2073.5,2076.5, hopefully it comes to life because then it'll be funny.
2076.5,2079.5," So like, yeah, I told you so, you know, I remember trying to tell you to play that,"
2079.5,2081.5, like six months ago or something.
2081.5,2084.5," But yeah, I think a lot of people once you try it, you're going to take this school,"
2084.5,2085.5, this is spread around.
2085.5,2087.5," Well, certain, no,"
2087.5,2090.5, a gaming age listeners can help out help out there.
2090.5,2091.5, Uh-huh.
2091.5,2092.5, Camping.
2092.5,2096.5," So certain PC games of the scobber do crossover like,"
2096.5,2098.5," I mean, basically everybody was playing pebble right."
2098.5,2100.5," I mean, I already got on that."
2100.5,2103.5, Yeah. So some of these peat casual peat has that come to life yet?
2103.5,2104.5," No, I don't think so."
2104.5,2106.5, Paggle? No. No.
2106.5,2110.5," Actually, it will need to be hilarious because we'll hear all over again about how"
2110.5,2112.5," you know, crazy crag it is."
2112.5,2114.5," Yeah, then we could be like people who were like,"
2114.5,2117.5, I was into that band before they would cool exactly.
2117.5,2118.5, Yeah.
2118.5,2119.5," Oh, you liked them now."
2119.5,2120.5, But it's not even that.
2120.5,2121.5," It's more the case of like,"
2121.5,2124.5, I was telling you for five years to listen to this band.
2124.5,2125.5, Yeah.
2125.5,2126.5, So it's not that I'm saying I listen to it before you.
2126.5,2128.5, It's saying why the fuck didn't you listen to me?
2128.5,2129.5, Try it.
2129.5,2132.5," You know, you didn't, you don't need like some expensive video card for it."
2133.5,2134.5, Got them right.
2134.5,2135.5, Yeah.
2135.5,2136.5, As holes.
2136.5,2142.5, What was the last time you got to invite you from anyone in Zifthavis to play a PC game ever?
2142.5,2145.5, There was no last time there was never one time.
2145.5,2148.5, That's because that's because they all have max.
2148.5,2150.5," No, that's because they don't play on the console."
2150.5,2152.5," Well, uh, I can't."
2152.5,2153.5, I can't.
2153.5,2154.5, I can't.
2154.5,2155.5," Yeah, surface."
2155.5,2156.5, There is actually one.
2156.5,2158.5, I'm thinking about there is one I told you so I just was reading about.
2158.5,2160.5," So there's just, there's a freeware game out there called The Blood,"
2160.5,2163.5, which is basically it's a kind of like Mario Sunshine.
2163.5,2164.5, It's gonna get.
2164.5,2165.5," Yeah, remember that."
2165.5,2167.5," I mean, we wrote up in a free loader on stuff."
2167.5,2168.5, Okay.
2168.5,2169.5, I don't want to want to one free game's thing.
2169.5,2170.5, And it's coming.
2170.5,2173.5," There actually the guy, the was college students who designed it."
2173.5,2175.5, And now it's going to be on the Wii.
2175.5,2176.5, Mm-hm.
2176.5,2178.5," So it's one of those things now where everyone's going to like all of a sudden say,"
2178.5,2181.5," Hey, look at this great game and like high free right now."
2181.5,2182.5, It just.
2182.5,2183.5, That's a thing.
2183.5,2186.5, So it just that means it went for me in a 7-11 donut that's been sitting in that
2186.5,2188.5, case for weeks to a crispy cream.
2189.5,2190.5, It just.
2190.5,2191.5, It just.
2191.5,2192.5, It just.
2192.5,2194.5, It just took it out of that shitty case.
2194.5,2195.5, It just.
2195.5,2196.5, These swap the cases.
2196.5,2197.5, Pretty.
2197.5,2198.5, Now it's a crispy cream.
2198.5,2199.5, Yeah.
2199.5,2200.5, Poof.
2200.5,2202.5, You gotta donut analogy thing going this week.
2202.5,2203.5, I do.
2203.5,2204.5, Yeah.
2204.5,2205.5, I got to spread it in meat.
2205.5,2206.5, Right.
2206.5,2207.5, We've banned meat from the podcast.
2207.5,2208.5, Which we'll get.
2208.5,2209.5, We're still not ready for that.
2209.5,2211.5, It's basically the hero of the web is getting.
2211.5,2212.5, I reveal that.
2212.5,2213.5, So it'll reveal itself.
2213.5,2214.5, The secret meat item.
2214.5,2215.5, I'll let.
2215.5,2216.5, This is.
2216.5,2219.5, Let's hear from Darren about fallout and just remind me to say something about
2219.5,2222.5, insurgency because that's actually pretty cool and there's some some stuff about that.
2222.5,2223.5, Okay.
2223.5,2224.5, Right.
2224.5,2225.5, So Darren.
2225.5,2227.5, Make visited Bethesda software in Bethesda.
2227.5,2228.5, Maryland.
2228.5,2229.5, Yes.
2229.5,2230.5, Yeah.
2230.5,2231.5, I got.
2231.5,2232.5, And here's his reply.
2232.5,2233.5," Well, okay."
2233.5,2234.5, So there's a couple ways I got break this down.
2234.5,2236.5, I can literally just walk you through the whole thing.
2236.5,2237.5, I got that I saw.
2237.5,2238.5, Which is.
2238.5,2240.5, It was pretty much a slice of a level.
2240.5,2241.5, Or at least a.
2241.5,2242.5, Without a level.
2242.5,2244.5, But like kind of like a good like the the intro game.
2244.5,2247.5, It's pretty good indication of where they plan on taking it.
2247.5,2249.5, I think you get to do character creation or any of that.
2249.5,2250.5," Well, they kind of."
2250.5,2253.5, It's kind of evolving process and I'll get to that.
2253.5,2258.5," But the one thing before I even get into it, I got to say is I came in with you know"
2258.5,2263.3," a certain like obviously optimistic, but this is always that skepticism like can they could they carry"
2263.3,2265.5, off this the the subtly humor.
2265.5,2271.5, Could they do the irony that I really loved about the first to the first game.
2271.5,2273.5, So to answer that question.
2273.5,2276.5," Yes, they did and they actually did a really smart job with it."
2276.5,2277.5, So I'll just walk through this whole thing.
2277.5,2284.5, So basically the game starts off and they wanted to convey that you're you're you're spending your entire life in this vault for like your first 19 years of life.
2284.5,2289.5," So the those 19 years are compressed into an hour worth of tutorials, I guess."
2289.5,2292.5, Where does this when does this take place in the ocean to fall?
2292.5,2293.5, Sure.
2293.5,2294.5, Absolutely.
2294.5,2299.5," So this so this takes place 30 years after fall out to but on the east coast around Washington, D.C. area."
2299.5,2303.5," So basically you're out of the debt, you know, you're not in the desert, you're your whole other thing."
2303.5,2307.5, And it totally disavows all knowledge of follow tactics ever happening.
2307.5,2315.5, And the the got off the the console again brother to steal the one that Sean likes referencing for all the scorpions laying.
2315.5,2316.5, That's really nice.
2316.5,2317.5," Yeah, sure."
2317.5,2318.5," Yeah, like game."
2318.5,2320.5, The first version is to kill 75 scorpions.
2320.5,2321.5, Seriously.
2321.5,2327.5, Do that you can't find like the last four and then we find them low and behold the boss is a fucking giant score.
2327.5,2335.5," And that was like, and then the next one is more and more and more and more and more and more and more scorpions."
2335.5,2336.5, So the one.
2336.5,2341.5," So when I first mentioned fall to you, I think because those are only exposed."
2341.5,2342.5," Followed series, right?"
2342.5,2343.5, Yeah.
2343.5,2345.5," So when I said fall, I told me he's like, Oh God."
2345.5,2346.5, No.
2346.5,2347.5, Paul.
2347.5,2350.5, I want to take it just played always talked about it.
2350.5,2353.5," And when we reviewed that one, he was like, you got to trust me man."
2353.5,2355.5, There's some good games in the series.
2355.5,2358.5, And I didn't know I was just a license.
2358.5,2359.5," Well, exactly."
2359.5,2360.5, That was my amir anyway.
2360.5,2361.5, So so anyway.
2361.5,2367.5," So yes, 30 years after fall out to and the whole point is that wanted to kind of go back to the original story."
2367.5,2375.5, And actually even like with with fall out to there is too many like inside jokes and winks and nods and fall out one kind of had that kind of true spirit of what they wanted to go for.
2375.5,2377.5, And they are carrying forward here.
2377.5,2378.5," Anyway, so okay."
2378.5,2380.5, So character development was your question.
2380.5,2381.5, You start off in the vault.
2381.5,2384.5," You're a baby and you see some kind of like, you know,"
2384.5,2396.5, DNA matrix kind of thing and you select what you're going to look like when you turn 19 and depending on what you choose that also affects what your father is going to look like your father is voiced by Liam Neeson in the beginning.
2396.5,2398.5, I always wanted him for a dad.
2398.5,2399.5, Me too.
2399.5,2400.5, Now it's coming true.
2400.5,2403.5, Did the faces look as disgusting as a bloody.
2403.5,2405.5," No, actually this is actually surprising."
2405.5,2408.5," But it's not as nearly as like, you know, shell act is,"
2408.5,2410.5, It's okay.
2410.5,2411.5, They were disgusting.
2411.5,2412.5, Yeah.
2412.5,2417.5, It's not like that would actually work here because this is the world of fall out.
2417.5,2418.5, Yeah.
2418.5,2420.5, Everyone's getting beaten.
2420.5,2421.5, Yeah.
2421.5,2422.5," Like I mean, shell act monkey face."
2422.5,2424.5, Just like in the future.
2424.5,2427.5, Why is everyone so greasy?
2427.5,2429.5, No one showers.
2429.5,2433.5," No anyway, so so basically they slowly introduce you to concepts."
2433.5,2439.5, They like you kind of flash forward to your toddler and they teach you the basics of WASD and operating things the environment.
2439.5,2442.5, You flash forward again to your 10th birthday.
2442.5,2445.5," So do you that that part, sorry, didn't you're actually controlling?"
2445.5,2451.5," I mean, is it, you know, like the sequence that we're so on half-light to where you learn to use the gravity gun by playing with dog?"
2451.5,2453.5," I mean, does it work like that?"
2453.5,2455.5," Where when you say you're you're you're learning, you know?"
2455.5,2460.5," Well, again, I haven't, I mean, this is, this is all kind of like, this is the part of the thing they didn't actually show us."
2460.5,2461.5, They kind of show us the tail end of it.
2461.5,2463.5," So I'm kind of like, this is what Todd Howard told me."
2463.5,2465.5," I think you're asking, are they walking you through?"
2465.5,2468.5," Are they walking if you're, is it just throwing like a bunch of video material?"
2468.5,2477.5," Oh no, no, it's actually, oh no, you're actually dragging around and you're learning to use, you know, your Pip boy 3000 by playing in this enclosed environment in the shelter."
2477.5,2479.5," Well, that's exactly, that's exactly it."
2479.5,2484.5," So like I was going to say, so actually, that's, that's the next thing was you're on your 10th birthday, you get your Pip boy."
2484.5,2488.5," Your, you know, your father gives you your Pip boy and a, and a, and a BB gun."
2488.5,2494.5, And you go around and you can just show things with your BB gun and you learn and you go from the Pip boy.
2494.5,2496.5, And it's apparently it's going to be all in game.
2496.5,2497.5," Yeah, that's pretty pretty damn good."
2497.5,2499.5, I think so too.
2499.5,2506.5," I mean, just for an organic way to, yeah, it's clever way to introduce your, your move set that has some continuity in your life."
2506.5,2507.5, Exactly.
2507.5,2508.5, It goes beyond here.
2508.5,2512.5," You are in the training section and the guy just keeps saying, try the M16."
2512.5,2515.5," Oh, my, try three targets and move on."
2515.5,2517.5, And then you like you keep shooting it for some reason.
2517.5,2518.5, Try the M16.
2518.5,2521.5, You turn out to start shooting him in the face.
2521.5,2526.5," And there's, there's the other convention of like an RPG, which like,"
2526.5,2531.5, you have been spending the past 19 years of your life and now you're ready to move out.
2531.5,2533.5," Okay, thank you for telling me all that."
2533.5,2534.5, I like to see you.
2534.5,2535.5, You're a console RPG.
2535.5,2538.5, As the text comes on the thing.
2538.5,2543.5," Fuck, there's people out there that swear that that story isn't gaging in some way."
2543.5,2544.5," Sorry, guys."
2544.5,2545.5, It's not.
2545.5,2546.5," So, and okay."
2546.5,2547.5, And all.
2547.5,2550.5," So, and you're 16th birthday in the game."
2550.5,2555.5," You take an aptitude test, which basically determines your, your kind of the class and skills you'll come."
2555.5,2557.5, Start with the game.
2557.5,2559.5," Kind of reminds me of like, at least how they're describing it."
2559.5,2562.5, Kind of reminds me of like way back fall in the ultimate series.
2562.5,2564.5," Like, told them before exactly."
2564.5,2565.5, So it's like a morality test.
2565.5,2567.5," I mean, that's still kind of again."
2567.5,2568.5, I have.
2568.5,2569.5, We don't know.
2569.5,2570.5, Probably with some sort of fallout spin.
2570.5,2571.5, Exactly.
2571.5,2574.5," Okay, but all that matters is there still have this, the perks and the skills."
2574.5,2576.5," So are they, is it special system?"
2576.5,2577.5, That's all caps special.
2577.5,2578.5, Are they using that to we now?
2578.5,2579.5," Yes, they are."
2579.5,2580.5, Okay.
2580.5,2581.5, Matter of fact.
2581.5,2584.5, I brought a checklist of all the little things that they've tested.
2584.5,2585.5, I actually came prepared.
2585.5,2586.5," What about that, huh?"
2586.5,2587.5, That's special.
2587.5,2588.5, Ain't that special.
2588.5,2590.5, Are you played dumb for the podcast or did you not?
2590.5,2591.5," No, I didn't know that."
2591.5,2594.5," I mean, he edited the damn preview."
2594.5,2596.5, That was like two weeks ago.
2596.5,2598.5, I'm sure it turned memory loss.
2598.5,2601.5, My soul been 10 years ago.
2601.5,2602.5, All right.
2602.5,2603.5, What's fallout through?
2603.5,2606.5, I was talking to tell us about the time I got an airport.
2606.5,2608.5, You asked him if you had a shot.
2608.5,2611.5, I would tell you the story.
2611.5,2612.5, All right.
2612.5,2615.5, So let me get into the game property and just kind of like start setting the movie.
2615.5,2619.5," The stuff that I kind of felt really kind of insulated they got the camera and I was,"
2619.5,2621.5, I'll tell you how to reach through something that I don't probably rambling.
2621.5,2622.5, All right.
2622.5,2624.5, So you get invited the rambles.
2624.5,2625.5, Okay.
2625.5,2626.5, You did.
2626.5,2629.5," You walk out of the vault because your mission, your father runs away for some reason."
2629.5,2630.5, He's missing.
2630.5,2631.5, You got to figure out what happened to him.
2631.5,2632.5, So your name needs to be me.
2632.5,2633.5, You're dead.
2633.5,2634.5, You're dead.
2634.5,2635.5, You have a dead be dead.
2635.5,2636.5," So anyway, you got to go chase him."
2636.5,2637.5, Figure out what's up.
2637.5,2638.5, You think that's what's wrong.
2638.5,2639.5, So you leave the vault for the first time in your life.
2639.5,2642.5, And they're really like the one thing that like I showed a lot.
2642.5,2646.5," Below and I were talking about beforehand when we saw the demo, the trailer was I really"
2646.5,2647.5, hope they had that moment.
2647.5,2651.5, You'll leave that first dungeon and you kind of walk out in the world and you go holy crap.
2651.5,2652.5, It's all there.
2652.5,2653.5, It sounds exactly the same.
2653.5,2654.5, You come out of the vault.
2654.5,2655.5, It does exactly it.
2655.5,2657.5, And the thing is it has that kind of humor.
2657.5,2661.5," So like as you come out of the vault, you can see like there's like a half dangling"
2661.5,2664.5, Sun and a road sign that's a scenic overview and you'll look out.
2664.5,2667.5," And it's like all like, you know, sandblast and wasteland."
2667.5,2671.5, It's not unlike the exactly what Vivian's court is exactly it.
2671.5,2675.5," I mean, a Olivia and puts you in that, you know, you're in that underground tunnel"
2675.5,2676.5, of under the jail.
2676.5,2677.5, It's almost their signature thing.
2677.5,2679.5," And then you come out into the world, right?"
2679.5,2680.5, True.
2680.5,2681.5, Yeah.
2681.5,2683.5," So it kind of, I mean, it follows that same kind of pattern."
2683.5,2685.5, But I think it still works.
2685.5,2691.5," And so anyway, so it leads you through the world and you can, and it's very open"
2691.5,2692.5, ended.
2692.5,2696.5," From the very beginning, you're walking to a town and you have the option to help a guy."
2696.5,2699.5," You walk into like one of the first, the town they showed us, Megaton."
2699.5,2702.5," There's a huge, unexploded atom bomb in the middle of the city."
2702.5,2704.5, Some guys are worshiping it.
2704.5,2706.5, Some guys are just kind of like walking by the guy.
2706.5,2707.5, There it is again.
2707.5,2711.5," And the sheriff, if you opt to help the sheriff, you can decide it."
2711.5,2713.5, And be a hero.
2713.5,2718.5," You can kill the sheriff, take his cost, take his outfit and you can be the new sheriff"
2718.5,2723.5," and there's one guy in town that wants to, wants you to detonate the bomb"
2723.5,2728.5, because they consider the Megaton a too much competition for another faction.
2728.5,2731.5," So early on in the game, you can totally nuke it in Tire City."
2731.5,2732.5, And that's kind of what they did.
2732.5,2734.5, And just to show like the variety of things you can do.
2734.5,2736.5, And that's so much in the spirit of the way.
2736.5,2737.5, Yeah.
2737.5,2738.5, That's absolutely awesome.
2738.5,2739.5, Right.
2739.5,2745.5," If you never played that RPG, it's really one of the ones where you could do whatever you wanted in that game."
2745.5,2748.5," I mean, the moral compass, it was totally up to you."
2748.5,2750.5, You could kill every single NPC in that game if you wanted to.
2750.5,2753.5," But then you're, and you're that that action would have consequences."
2753.5,2754.5, And that was the cool part.
2754.5,2760.5," And it looks like, I mean, they really are kind of like keeping the spirit of the game alive."
2760.5,2762.5, And they really are paying a lot of attention.
2762.5,2766.5," And definitely the humor is there like, like there's one weapon that I kind of stuck along to."
2766.5,2767.5, I thought it was pretty funny.
2767.5,2768.5, It's like so this is thing called the fat man.
2768.5,2770.5," It launches like, it's a personal nuke launcher."
2770.5,2772.5, So I'm fighting a super mutant.
2772.5,2774.5, Or I'm not fighting with their fighting a super mutant.
2774.5,2775.5, They shoot this thing off.
2775.5,2778.5, And it creates a small mushroom cloud that incinerates this guy.
2778.5,2782.5," And then when he's ready to fire another one, it's got the thing."
2782.5,2784.5, Like a turkey's done time or goes off.
2784.5,2786.5, And like the next the next person's loaded.
2786.5,2788.5, It's like subtle stuff like that.
2788.5,2791.5," So many, like a good division."
2791.5,2794.5," So many games like RPGs, like, like,"
2794.5,2798.5," Telt that, you know, any action you do will completely like change the world."
2798.5,2799.5, Right. Right.
2799.5,2801.5, This faction is going to be completely different.
2801.5,2803.5, It's been doing that forever.
2803.5,2805.5," Just stop stop railing on that as like,"
2805.5,2807.5, It's just for the US police.
2807.5,2808.5, Right.
2808.5,2810.5," I mean, you pointed out in the story recently,"
2810.5,2811.5, It's good.
2811.5,2813.5," Because, you know, we're always privately clowning on it."
2813.5,2815.5," But when we see a game demo or something,"
2815.5,2818.5," PR, the developers always insisting that"
2818.5,2821.5, There's a lack of repeatability.
2821.5,2824.5," You know, this is going to have this is different every time you play."
2824.5,2826.5," And it got to the point where you're,"
2826.5,2828.5," you're saying that because this barrel,"
2828.5,2830.5, because physics are operating on this barrel.
2830.5,2831.5," And it just means it's going to like,"
2831.5,2834.5, it might fall over to the right and blow up or it could fall back where it's on
2834.5,2837.5, block or it could just wobble and stay there and then blow up.
2837.5,2839.5," Yeah, but it's infinitely replayable."
2839.5,2841.5, But then they say that and then you're just supposed to write that down.
2841.5,2843.5," Like, okay, different shit every time I play."
2843.5,2844.5, Every time I play.
2844.5,2847.5," And then like, you know, the guy, would you shoot a guy?"
2847.5,2849.5," You know, he could fall forward or back."
2849.5,2851.5, All right. I hear you differentiate every time I play.
2851.5,2852.5, Totally different.
2852.5,2853.5, Yeah.
2853.5,2856.5, But that doesn't greatly relate to it.
2856.5,2858.5," No, that's the extreme."
2858.5,2859.5, That's the extreme.
2859.5,2863.5, People understand that it was an attractive list for your features set.
2863.5,2864.5, It is a good US.
2864.5,2870.5," And just took it to, you know, ridiculous lengths and now call everything that doesn't operate."
2870.5,2871.5, Yeah.
2871.5,2872.5, That's uttered.
2872.5,2873.5, I have to treat it.
2873.5,2874.5, Yeah.
2874.5,2876.5," I mean, I really write it as one of those things."
2876.5,2878.5," It's sort of like, that's all you need an example."
2878.5,2880.5," Like, so I did just go, okay, see that's pretty cool."
2880.5,2881.5, Yeah.
2881.5,2882.5," I mean, they aren't saying infinite replayability,"
2882.5,2883.5," but they are saying there's definitely, like,"
2883.5,2886.5," there's, you could definitely see a cause and effect to what you do because,"
2886.5,2889.5," for example, if you, if you blow up Megaton early in the game,"
2889.5,2892.5, that city is wiped off the map and there's no going back to it.
2892.5,2894.5, So all the missions that were part of that are just out.
2894.5,2895.5, Right.
2895.5,2900.5," In over a decade of playing RPGs, well over a decade, sadly, more like two decades."
2900.5,2905.5," Followed, one of the only ones that I played more than once simply because I wanted to see"
2905.5,2908.5, how it would play out differently if I tried a different way.
2908.5,2913.5," And it plays out totally differently, not just like a little bit differently, like,"
2913.5,2917.5," you know, okay, so the cutscene changes to this at the end if you do this."
2917.5,2921.5," You know, it's, you know, it's, it was practically like two different games."
2921.5,2922.5, So to play it.
2922.5,2926.5," And it was text based, so you can get the problem you do with the audio ones where it's like,"
2926.5,2930.5," hey, I know you, you think I, who blew up my town?"
2930.5,2933.5," But it just, but it actually changed that as a roadway."
2933.5,2934.5, Like a mad live.
2934.5,2935.5, Yeah.
2935.5,2938.5," Well, actually, that was one of the first games I had to voice."
2938.5,2940.5," That was one of the first games that, so it did that?"
2940.5,2942.5," Yeah, well, it didn't, it wasn't like that."
2942.5,2943.5, It wasn't like that.
2943.5,2944.5, It had like one voice.
2944.5,2947.5," It had like the, like, you click on them and like the first open the opening line of text."
2947.5,2948.5," Yeah, they would read like one line."
2948.5,2949.5, Yeah.
2949.5,2950.5, But then the rest would just text.
2950.5,2951.5," Yeah, that's right."
2951.5,2954.5," Let me, okay, so that's the thing."
2954.5,2961.5," Well, go to, that's the worst ever is, you know, armed assault because they'll have like"
2961.5,2964.5, pre-recorded dialogue that some of the characters will say.
2964.5,2969.5," So like, example in training or a mission, no one of your sergeants is talking to you."
2969.5,2971.5, And he has to say this one of graph voice.
2971.5,2974.5," And then they have the other spontaneous, regenerated stuff."
2974.5,2976.5, But the same character will go back and forth between it.
2976.5,2979.5," So you could get like, hey, sergeant, get your ass in that home."
2979.5,2983.5," And then all of a sudden he's like, two clicks to the left."
2983.5,2984.5, Self-eased.
2984.5,2986.5, And then he starts yelling at you.
2986.5,2987.5," You're like, what the fuck's going on?"
2987.5,2989.5, It's like Joe Montana from Genesis.
2989.5,2990.5, Joe Montana real sports in Genesis.
2990.5,2991.5, Or to the floor.
2991.5,2993.5, I've been shot in the arm.
2993.5,2998.5," I'm not going to retell it because I've told him many times, but the best ever on this point"
2998.5,3001.5, into the right direction is of course wrestling games.
3001.5,3002.5," Oh, yeah."
3002.5,3005.5, The same audio engine from the wrestling game that was used in WWE.
3005.5,3006.5, You crush our check it out.
3007.5,3009.5, You want to audio treat?
3009.5,3010.5, All right.
3010.5,3012.5, So I'll just wrap this up really quick.
3012.5,3015.5, There's two other things that I wanted to mention.
3015.5,3017.5," First of all, weapons degrade in the game."
3017.5,3019.5," So you actually, it definitely makes it convey that it's"
3019.5,3021.5, since you have to scavenge for parts.
3021.5,3024.5, So like you can't feel strip of pistol and like slap the
3024.5,3028.5, shells into into into into into into into into the salt rifle.
3028.5,3032.5, You have to look for an assault rifle and kind of take the best pieces and put them together.
3032.5,3035.5," And and actually if it actually affects how you shoot now,"
3035.5,3036.5, that's the last thing.
3036.5,3038.5," This is a first person shooter, but it also plays,"
3038.5,3043.5, it pays tribute to the original turn-based tactics of the first games.
3043.5,3045.5, So this is the part that I think is really cool.
3045.5,3049.5," And like I was, this is the part I was probably the most skeptical about until I saw it in action"
3049.5,3052.5, is that you can play it as a first person shooter.
3052.5,3055.5, And there's this little meter for action points in the lower right corner.
3055.5,3057.5," You hit, they show the game on the 360."
3057.5,3060.5," So they actually, you know, they were showing it with a gamepad."
3060.5,3063.5," Anyway, so you hit one of the buttons on it."
3064.5,3067.5, And it freezes time and it shows your perception levels.
3067.5,3070.5," And just like the old game where you can say, okay, I want to trap,"
3070.5,3074.5, snap a headshot or shoot an arm or shoot the weapon out of his hand or whatever.
3074.5,3077.5, It gives your percentages for each part of his body when I hit.
3077.5,3080.5, And it would cost more action points depending on what you wanted to do.
3080.5,3081.5, Exactly.
3081.5,3085.5, And so you pull off that turn-based like shot.
3085.5,3088.5, And it's just like the old game.
3088.5,3092.5, And then you go back to real time and you can just keep shooting.
3092.5,3095.5, And then the action points slowly regenerate according to one of your stats.
3095.5,3097.5, So I thought it was a really smart implementation.
3097.5,3102.5," They kind of like, you know, it adds something new to the genre that it's kind of like a nod back to the old days."
3102.5,3103.5, Kind of reminds me.
3103.5,3104.5, I'm sorry.
3104.5,3108.5," If you're in real time shooting stuff, can you still pull off a headshot without?"
3108.5,3109.5, It isn't really a zack.
3109.5,3111.5," I mean, that's that's strictly skill-based at that point."
3111.5,3112.5, So it's going to be a lot tougher.
3112.5,3114.5," You got to like, you know, actually, you have to actually,"
3114.5,3116.5," you know, aim down and like,"
3116.5,3119.5, but they're probably throwing randomizer on your shot fall too though.
3119.5,3120.5," Yeah, that's what I'm wondering."
3120.5,3123.5," Right. Well, me like, let's say, for example, like, you know, your weapon is in just repair,"
3123.5,3125.5, or at least it's not as it's not in like top-worked water.
3125.5,3128.5," That's basically how a stalker work, you know?"
3128.5,3131.5, Yeah. So you have a weapon that's like 95% degraded.
3131.5,3135.5, You could have your crosshair like in the silence eye and not hit him.
3135.5,3136.5, Yeah.
3136.5,3140.5," It's throwing randomized, in accuracy on there to reflect the damage."
3140.5,3141.5, Right.
3141.5,3142.5, But you have the option to fix the weapon.
3142.5,3145.5," And I like the, I really do like this being able to stop time things."
3145.5,3149.5," Technically, if I really wanted to, I could just, I could play it like the old games technically."
3149.5,3153.5," But, um, my first person perspective, or actually there's also a chase cam."
3153.5,3158.5, So you could do it for those who really give a crap about the paper doll effect and seeing their guy with all their cool gear.
3158.5,3160.5, You can play the entire game from third person.
3160.5,3161.5, Awesome.
3161.5,3163.5," Well, this is, uh, okay, Ryan's going to fly down."
3163.5,3166.5," That freezing time thing is really how Cotor work, too, isn't it?"
3166.5,3169.5," Well, I mean, it was kind of like the invisible strategy stuff."
3169.5,3171.5," I mean, you could just let the game run."
3171.5,3172.5, Right. You could just play Cotor.
3172.5,3174.5, You could just go into any battle on real time.
3174.5,3175.5, Yeah.
3175.5,3178.5," But at any point, you could hit the space bar and freeze it and plan out your moves."
3178.5,3179.0, Exactly.
3179.0,3180.5," Right. I mean, that's even a baller's game work."
3180.5,3181.0, Yeah.
3181.0,3181.5, Baller's game.
3181.5,3182.0, Right.
3182.0,3182.5, Sure.
3182.5,3184.5, I guess all those black algorithms.
3184.5,3185.5," And the word is, I mean, you say,"
3185.5,3188.0," I thought third person and you think, but then you think of bliving."
3188.0,3189.5," Like, okay, it was there."
3189.5,3190.0, Yeah.
3190.0,3190.5, Yeah.
3190.5,3192.5, It didn't need to be because it was ridiculous.
3192.5,3193.5, You were kind of redoing it.
3193.5,3197.5, But I can't be assisting that they're learning from that experience.
3197.5,3198.5, Absolutely.
3198.5,3199.5, Making it.
3199.5,3201.0," I mean, from, from what I've heard,"
3201.0,3204.0, they insist that it's entirely playable from that perspective.
3204.0,3208.5, And it's not going to be like a bliving where third person was when you wanted to see what
3208.5,3210.5, it looked like when you jumped off the highest cliff you could.
3210.5,3212.5, You wanted to see your horse.
3212.5,3213.5, Yeah.
3213.5,3215.5, And it's like this armor dammit.
3215.5,3218.5," No, but overall, I mean, I'd still,"
3218.5,3221.5," over a year, I'd probably a year and a half away, I think."
3221.5,3223.5, And it's looking great.
3223.5,3225.5," So far, I mean, this little bit they shown him."
3225.5,3229.5," I mean, it shows a lot of the potential for where this series was."
3229.5,3231.5," And well, they got a big legacy to look up to."
3231.5,3232.5, Absolutely.
3232.5,3234.5," One, they don't want to fuck up."
3234.5,3237.5, And we'll be seeing it over at E3 next week.
3237.5,3238.0, Yeah.
3238.0,3239.0, Yeah.
3239.0,3241.0, Who's going for us to check it out?
3241.0,3242.0, Yeah.
3242.0,3243.0, You guys should check it out.
3243.0,3244.0, I was going for us to check it out.
3244.0,3246.0, You guys should check it out.
3246.0,3248.0, If you have the time to just go with the wind.
3248.0,3249.0, I don't understand.
3249.0,3251.0," I mean, you don't even know what's happening."
3251.0,3252.0, You need to know what's happening.
3252.0,3253.0, I don't know what it is.
3253.0,3254.0, Don't know what it is.
3254.0,3256.0, It's like a dude going to a wedding.
3256.0,3258.0, I can guarantee that my body's there.
3258.0,3259.0," Yeah, exactly."
3259.0,3260.0, Just tell me when to be there.
3260.0,3261.0," Oh, go."
3261.0,3262.0, Right.
3262.0,3264.0, Do I need to bring a gift?
3264.0,3266.0, Can I just write a check right?
3266.0,3269.0, I just don't want to hold my hand and do I have to wear a tie?
3269.0,3270.0, Exactly.
3270.0,3273.0, Just casual or yeah.
3273.0,3274.0, Fuck you three.
3274.0,3275.0, Yeah.
3275.0,3276.0, Fuck it and it's fucking ear.
3276.0,3277.0, Yeah.
3277.0,3278.0, So yeah.
3278.0,3280.0, Now message to whoever organized D3 this year.
3280.0,3281.0, Fuck you.
3281.0,3282.0, Yeah.
3282.0,3283.0, Fuck you for ruining our lives this year.
3283.0,3284.0, We're going to.
3284.0,3285.0, Thanks.
3285.0,3286.0, You owe me.
3286.0,3288.0, I'll save the insurgents to talk for later.
3288.0,3289.0, Yeah.
3289.0,3291.0, Darren pointed out we've got an excellent transition.
3291.0,3293.0, Let's not miss it while we're on the subject of E3.
3293.0,3294.0, Okay.
3294.0,3296.0, The hero of the web.
3296.0,3298.0," Oh, the redness hero and then we'll take a breath."
3298.0,3300.0, And this one's even got a title.
3300.0,3303.0, It's called gauging E3's rebirth.
3303.0,3304.0, Let me go.
3304.0,3305.0, It's little something like this.
3305.0,3306.0, Who the?
3306.0,3307.0, All right.
3307.0,3308.0, Good.
3308.0,3315.0," Well, the E3 format of last year is official dead along with scads of amazingly attractive woman,"
3315.0,3317.0, especially the Nintendo booth.
3317.0,3319.0," To the scantily clad booth bay,"
3319.0,3322.0, pinping games like driver brings a tear of loss to the eye.
3322.0,3327.0, Going through the schedules and listening to press people talk about the show has helped to change my perspective.
3327.0,3332.0," This year, without its security by allowing PR people to verify media types,"
3332.0,3334.0, there's still a lot going on.
3334.0,3339.0," And I think that the game daily staff will be able to deliver better stories with more detail,"
3339.0,3342.0, simply because the crazy background noise are half cloth booth bay.
3342.0,3346.0, Won't distract from what you deserve to know more about.
3346.0,3349.0," With any show, there are negatives."
3349.0,3351.0, Smaller developers aren't respected.
3351.0,3356.0, And the EI EI O show happens at the nearby hotel California to help pick up the slack.
3356.0,3359.0," And by knowing GameCox Mike Wilson,"
3359.0,3363.0, there will be a touch of the former show that will employ former booth babes.
3363.0,3367.0, All still reserve final judgment until the show starts in Santa Monica.
3367.0,3370.0," Yet from the emails, voice mail, phone calls,"
3370.0,3376.0, and the juggling of schedules that glitz glam and luster may have been gleamed from the teeth of E3.
3376.0,3383.0, But the meat of the spirit of the show is now made bare and ready to show gamers what the next few years will bring.
3383.0,3388.0," As our group's former guidance counselor of sorts was often known for yelling,"
3388.0,3391.0, Game on!
3391.0,3393.0, Game on!
3393.0,3394.0, Game on!
3394.0,3396.0, Game on! Game on!
3396.0,3397.0, That's a game on!
3397.0,3398.0, That's a game on!
3398.0,3399.0, That's a first.
3399.0,3400.0, I hate it.
3400.0,3405.0," I obviously hate to do it, but that we never did something that didn't come from just a message board."
3405.0,3409.0, It was actually an official story on the Game Press website.
3409.0,3411.0, So let's see what's going on.
3411.0,3412.0, So let's see what's going on.
3412.0,3415.0," I mean, how do we excuse it?"
3415.0,3418.0," Just the fact that this, it shouldn't be out there, man."
3418.0,3420.0, It's not doing the writing phrases like that.
3420.0,3423.0, The meat of the spirit of the show.
3423.0,3425.0, That's a phrase you don't want to be using.
3425.0,3427.0, Don't forget the last part.
3427.0,3428.0, Made bare.
3428.0,3429.0, Made bare.
3429.0,3430.0, So let's strike that.
3430.0,3433.0," Even if we chill on that comment for a moment, you could part of it."
3433.0,3434.0," I mean, how's way there?"
3434.0,3436.0," I'm like, come on Jeff, bear your meat."
3436.0,3437.0, Bear your meat.
3437.0,3438.0," Come on, dog."
3438.0,3440.0," And then I'm like, asking me to bear my meat."
3440.0,3443.0, Bear the spirit of your meat for me.
3443.0,3444.0, Bear the spirit of your meat.
3444.0,3446.0, That's a restaurant and I like it.
3446.0,3448.0, So that's why I'm striking through meat.
3448.0,3451.0," When I only say it, but we've got this white board in Jeff's office."
3451.0,3453.0, I can't really wrote on it with permanent markers.
3453.0,3454.0," Yeah, you did."
3454.0,3455.0," You were bad, but that's fine."
3455.0,3456.0, I believe it's tough to stand.
3456.0,3458.0, And it's not just here.
3458.0,3460.0, It appears everywhere.
3460.0,3462.0," If you're listening, again, look for it."
3462.0,3467.0, This is it's meaty components are the meat potatoes of this game and the meaty experience.
3467.0,3468.0, And there's more meat to it.
3468.0,3471.0, It's like it's like the fucking sausage factory after a while.
3471.0,3472.0," You know what, so much."
3472.0,3476.0," Game's, are we talking about the delicates and the what are some other band phrases?"
3476.0,3477.0," Well, we know gaming good."
3477.0,3478.0, We've got a lot.
3478.0,3480.0, Let's not reveal them all because there's quite a few.
3480.0,3481.0, We don't want to tip our hand just yet.
3481.0,3486.0," But no, they're, yeah, I mean, even, even, like, perfectly good words."
3486.0,3488.0, The problematic after a while compelling.
3488.0,3490.0," Say, for example, get overused."
3490.0,3492.0, And what happens is it's eventually used.
3492.0,3493.0, Sending 3D.
3493.0,3499.0," So many times that even when it's used in the appropriate circumstances, it no longer means much of anything."
3499.0,3502.0," Yeah, audience because I've heard this so many times."
3502.0,3504.0," It's like, you know, I've talked about before."
3504.0,3508.0, The review blurbs for the shack movies because I'm in.
3508.0,3510.0, Both say fun.
3510.0,3511.0, That was the only quote on that.
3511.0,3514.0," It's like at that point, that means absolutely nothing."
3514.0,3517.0," It doesn't even, it doesn't even mean it's fun."
3517.0,3526.0," So instead of saying compelling, like, you know, a taller writer will show me it's compelling, you know, like just talking about what is it about this game that's compelling."
3526.0,3530.0," And then you don't have to stop and say it is because you've already proved it, you know,"
3530.0,3531.0, Are you've already made a strong case for it?
3531.0,3532.0, So that's another example.
3532.0,3535.0, And then there's just there's completely ridiculous stuff.
3535.0,3536.0, It appears every month.
3536.0,3539.0," But, um, like visuals, crisp audio, taking controls."
3539.0,3541.0, And variations on.
3541.0,3544.0," Ratchet, matching up the visuals on level 3."
3544.0,3547.0," Very, very, she's on lines, tigers, bears on my."
3547.0,3548.0, So that's why it's really.
3548.0,3553.0, And this is funny because I remember the first week I started EGM so many years ago.
3553.0,3555.0, I need to know when around clowning on that.
3555.0,3558.0," It was like, oh, God, like someone else did it again."
3558.0,3559.0, Something something something something.
3559.0,3560.0, Oh my.
3560.0,3561.0, Yeah.
3561.0,3562.0, And it's like to this day.
3562.0,3565.0," I mean, just, it was in some headlines for."
3565.0,3566.0," Oh, it's in Gabbland."
3566.0,3567.0, So my.
3567.0,3568.0, Yeah.
3568.0,3571.0, That was in our met and our met at a style guide is never used this.
3571.0,3572.0," Like, was officially a hostile guide."
3572.0,3573.0," I mean, that's beyond."
3573.0,3577.0," You should have the kind of stuff you shouldn't even have to tell someone, but you will still see it over and over."
3577.0,3578.0," Uh, view to a kill."
3578.0,3582.0," We took out and that was never, you can't have that caption ever again."
3582.0,3583.0, First screen shot.
3583.0,3584.0, Yeah.
3584.0,3585.0, Get it.
3585.0,3586.0, It's a view to a kill.
3586.0,3588.0," And like the James Bond movie, right?"
3588.0,3589.0, Right.
3589.0,3594.0," It's just about knowing that, I mean, especially within the easiest audience, they're absorbing so much of the stuff."
3594.0,3595.0, And if you are just.
3595.0,3598.0, You're going to rely on one to watch for in the mainstream press.
3598.0,3601.0, Whenever there's a mainstream press article on games.
3601.0,3605.0, The other headline is going to be let the games begin.
3605.0,3609.0," Every time I fucking see it, I want to toss whatever I'm reading with it."
3609.0,3610.0," Time magazine, whatever it is."
3610.0,3612.0, Like come up with a different one.
3612.0,3613.0, Goodness.
3613.0,3614.0, They've already begun.
3614.0,3620.0," So there's something else to note on the here, the way there's the there's a comment listed under the story."
3620.0,3621.0, Yeah.
3621.0,3622.0, It was at herping.
3622.0,3623.0, And herping user herping.
3623.0,3627.0," Jerbs said as our groups former, when, no, he didn't say actually a pace of the wrong thing."
3627.0,3628.0, I can let's see for memory.
3628.0,3631.0, It said that further proof further evidence.
3631.0,3632.0," Yeah, it's here."
3632.0,3633.0," Oh, you've got, okay, here we go."
3633.0,3637.0, Proof positive that take your child to work days at National Traction.
3637.0,3641.0," What's the, the reason that you read this and that words here are going on."
3641.0,3643.0, So this was at a gaming website.
3643.0,3648.0," And it is, you might not be able to tell because you need to like the punctuation and everything to see it."
3648.0,3650.0, This is like semi fucking literate.
3650.0,3652.0," No, it's actually, it definitely is."
3652.0,3656.0," It's, it's frustrating because, you know, everyone, I get PM's."
3656.0,3660.0," Like, hey, how do you, uh, what do I need to do if I want to write about games?"
3660.0,3661.0, I want to do what you do.
3661.0,3665.0," And after a while, you know, I first, I start off and I tell them things."
3665.0,3669.0," It then sounds like, same thing I'm going to tell you if you're asking to work at"
3669.0,3670.0, Jack in the box.
3670.0,3672.0," No, like, don't murder nobody."
3672.0,3675.0," And if you murdered somebody, then get your fucking record to him."
3675.0,3676.0, Otherwise you're in.
3676.0,3678.0," Well, look at the club buddy."
3678.0,3680.0, Combo toast problem.
3680.0,3681.0, That's so comitose.
3681.0,3685.0," Yeah, I mean, that the very first fucking phrase of this story."
3685.0,3690.0," When, while the E3 format of last year is official dead,"
3690.0,3691.0, that's not even English.
3691.0,3695.0," That's not, but if you go free, but if you go to the next part, too, it's like, along with"
3695.0,3699.0," Scads of amazingly attractive woman and that's singular, but then especially"
3699.0,3700.0, the Nintendo booth.
3700.0,3704.0, So the way that that's constructed means that the Nintendo booth is an
3704.0,3707.0," amazingly attractive woman, right?"
3707.0,3711.0," And also Sean also take out the, take out the claws in the middle,"
3711.0,3714.0, because he then you realize that he's lost it.
3714.0,3717.0," If he take out the claws and try to read it as a straight sentence,"
3717.0,3721.0," yeah, take out the E3 format of last year is official dead going"
3721.0,3723.0, rings the tear of lost to the eye.
3723.0,3724.0, Yeah.
3724.0,3725.0, At this point.
3725.0,3727.0," See, there's nothing even follow."
3727.0,3728.0," No, it does."
3728.0,3731.0," I mean, what a bunch of jackals we are."
3731.0,3732.0, Holy crap.
3732.0,3736.0, The point is not so much shit for this person.
3736.0,3740.0," Listen, the point is not just, yeah, we're not just trying to rip on"
3740.0,3741.0, one site.
3741.0,3745.0, The point is this shit is all over the industry.
3745.0,3748.0," And then the gaming press is like doing this all like,"
3748.0,3751.0," Naval gazing like, how come no one takes us serious?"
3751.0,3753.0, Because you don't deserve it.
3753.0,3755.0, This is like fucking third grade writing.
3755.0,3758.0," It's like, yeah, you get, you know, we're saying."
3758.0,3762.0," If the joke is that if the word, we farm our word from high school,"
3762.0,3765.0," I mean, that's not something a circumvent child labor laws that we're now."
3765.0,3766.0, I should apologize.
3766.0,3768.0," Yeah, yeah, we, it's just like someone's like,"
3768.0,3770.0, wrote it with crayon at first.
3770.0,3773.0," Yeah, now if I go like tell someone, I'm in the game industry."
3773.0,3774.0, And this is what they know.
3774.0,3778.0," They're just like, oh, oh, the game drickin' wasn't good."
3778.0,3779.0," Now like we'll, we'll fess up."
3779.0,3780.0, We fuck up.
3780.0,3781.0," We, yeah, first plenty of shit."
3781.0,3783.0, I'll bring up the embarrassed of someone held it up.
3783.0,3784.0, We hate snakes.
3784.0,3786.0, Remember when you wrote this?
3786.0,3788.0," Unfortunately, I do."
3788.0,3790.0," Yeah, but also not to it, you know, like,"
3790.0,3793.0," and I guarantee I never wrote anything like that, though."
3793.0,3798.0," Oh, this is the internet you can go change it."
3798.0,3799.0, Let's get a break.
3799.0,3800.0," Oh, let's get a break."
3800.0,3802.0," And I will take a break and go, I'll take a rep on them."
3802.0,3803.0, Come back here.
3803.0,3804.0, We need it.
3804.0,3805.0, Next we shall Ryan.
3805.0,3806.0, Okay.
3806.0,3807.0, We're so happy.
3807.0,3809.0, We'll be right back with more heat.
3809.0,3813.0, This one up podcast is brought to you by Windows Media Center.
3813.0,3817.0," Your Xbox 360, your music, your photos, your TV shows,"
3817.0,3820.0, and your videos with one connection.
3820.0,3822.0, Hi.
3822.0,3826.0," So, so, one last thing on this bad video game journal,"
3827.0,3830.0," something I said, I think, you know,"
3830.0,3834.0," definitely we've printed bad things and we've probably all written bad things,"
3834.0,3836.0," or I know we have that have been printed,"
3836.0,3840.0," but I think the big difference here is that when we get the really bad ones that are illiterate,"
3840.0,3842.0, we don't print them.
3842.0,3845.0, We keep them here and we laugh amongst ourselves.
3845.0,3849.0, We've got them a few photos that we bring out and read to each other.
3849.0,3850.0, I remember this.
3850.0,3852.0, We're in some cases we rewrite them.
3852.0,3853.0, And then write them.
3853.0,3854.0," Oh, yes."
3854.0,3855.0, Yeah.
3855.0,3856.0, Yeah.
3856.0,3857.0," So, all right."
3857.0,3858.0, That's move on.
3858.0,3859.0, Okay.
3859.0,3863.0," That's you're going to drop us some classic quotes from the, from our classics."
3863.0,3864.0, Right.
3864.0,3867.0, That was one that sort of we said in front of us the lot.
3867.0,3868.0, We should do that next show.
3868.0,3869.0, Okay.
3869.0,3870.0," Well, that's what we'll do."
3870.0,3871.0, We'll do it.
3871.0,3872.0, We'll do it.
3872.0,3873.0, We'll do it.
3873.0,3874.0, We'll do it.
3874.0,3875.0, We'll do it.
3875.0,3876.0, We'll do it.
3876.0,3877.0, We'll do that.
3877.0,3878.0, We'll do that.
3878.0,3879.0, We'll do that.
3879.0,3880.0, We'll do that.
3880.0,3881.0, We'll do that.
3881.0,3883.0, And you'll hear some more examples of video.
3883.0,3884.0, Bad video game writing from our own public.
3884.0,3892.0," I got to remember the whole like how I've had, I have like the whole pant of my routine for that like beating down the competition and lifting up the."
3892.0,3893.0, I have to do some.
3893.0,3894.0," So, I'm not a cost."
3894.0,3895.0, We'll sing in the song.
3895.0,3896.0, It's guys in here.
3896.0,3897.0, Okay.
3897.0,3899.0," So, in the interest of fairness next week, we will make fun of ourselves."
3899.0,3900.0, Okay.
3900.0,3901.0," Actually, I thought we're not complete pop of this."
3901.0,3903.0," Actually, I have an awesome tech feature that falls exactly like that."
3903.0,3905.0, I'd read the entire story from scratch.
3905.0,3906.0, Excellent.
3906.0,3907.0, All right.
3907.0,3909.0," And so, more bad writing next week from our own coffers."
3909.0,3910.0, Right.
3910.0,3911.0, All right.
3911.0,3913.0, Next up on the list.
3913.0,3916.0," So, Sean Elliott's going to talk about insidency."
3916.0,3917.0, Okay.
3917.0,3918.0, I'm not a somewhere.
3918.0,3919.0, It's like Catherine Hepburn.
3919.0,3920.0, It's really being pompous.
3920.0,3921.0, Yeah.
3921.0,3922.0, Yeah.
3922.0,3925.0," So, it's a, as I said, it's a source mod."
3925.0,3927.0, It just came out yesterday.
3927.0,3930.0," It's been in development for, I know at least a year."
3930.0,3932.0, I'm thinking two years.
3932.0,3933.0, And who made it?
3933.0,3936.0, It's a emergency mod team.
3936.0,3937.0, Okay.
3937.0,3938.0," So, I actually zicked that's the name."
3939.0,3940.0, Okay.
3940.0,3941.0," So, actually refreshment memory."
3941.0,3942.0, Which one is this?
3942.0,3944.0, This is another shooting shooting bang bang.
3944.0,3948.0, It's set in contemporary Iraq.
3948.0,3952.0," And although there are some issues there because, you know, there's still big pictures."
3952.0,3954.0, It's like it's called in certainty.
3954.0,3957.0, But there's still big banners of salam up and stuff in the city.
3957.0,3960.0," It's like, because it's been taken a little bit of a chronological problem there."
3960.0,3965.0," But it is an interesting, of course, that's a setting that no, you know, real"
3965.0,3966.0, development developers going to touch.
3966.0,3969.0, We just were talking to the guys making the CD water warfare.
3969.0,3972.0," And, you know, it's asking about the realism of other locations and stuff."
3972.0,3976.0," But just because I was kind of waiting to give us kind of baiting them to see what they had to say about, you know,"
3976.0,3977.0, where Middle East is concerned.
3977.0,3986.0," And as I suspected, if it's in Russia, if the environment's anywhere else, exactly, you know, based on, you know, our, our photos and real places and stuff."
3986.0,3988.0," So, as it comes to Middle East, we won't even name a country."
3988.0,3989.0, Right.
3989.0,3993.0," It's just, it's either a central Asian or Middle Eastern locale."
3993.0,3995.0," It's like, I'm sure, I jerk a Durkestin."
3995.0,3996.0, You'll know.
3996.0,4001.0," And if you, if you, if you want last season of 24, the, the bad guy, the Middle Eastern bad guys,"
4001.0,4004.0," not once in the entire season, do they name the country?"
4004.0,4006.0, Do they always say the or do they do?
4006.0,4007.0, They do.
4007.0,4013.0," They're clearly Arabic, but whenever it's referred to and I listened for it, close to it was always in their country."
4013.0,4015.0," In your country, they never actually named it."
4015.0,4016.0, Yeah.
4016.0,4018.0," So, um, so unlike that, you know, it clearly."
4018.0,4021.0," So, I mean, and yes, why they say, you know, for, for sense,"
4021.0,4024.0," of understanding and stuff, that's a whole, another political argument we don't need to get into."
4024.0,4027.0," But so, interestingly for mod, it is set in that environment."
4027.0,4034.0," Um, and it's, it's called a realism mod, which basically means you walk slow and single shots kill."
4034.0,4037.0," But, um, it's actually pretty fun."
4037.0,4040.0," I mean, it first, first thing goes is it looks so good."
4040.0,4046.0," Especially for mod team, it would look very presentable if it were a retail game that we're released right now."
4046.0,4049.0," And today's landscape, you know, against competition."
4050.0,4052.0," Um, the mapping environments are great."
4052.0,4053.0, The weapon models are phenomenal.
4053.0,4055.0," I mean, just entirely professional."
4055.0,4058.0," Game itself, you know, there's really not too much."
4058.0,4061.0, It's all about the application of your tactics and team play and stuff.
4061.0,4063.0, But it's still fun.
4063.0,4065.0," I mean, I like, I like going through."
4065.0,4070.0," It's not too frustrating, because the spot, you, it's not like counter strike where if you die and you will die quick."
4070.0,4072.0," You know, you have to wait out through us in the match."
4072.0,4074.0, You just have to wait for a while.
4075.0,4082.0," Um, to the pursuit of realism, you don't even get an indication that you killed someone other than the physical, you know, parents and them falling over."
4082.0,4087.0," So if you're fighting someone at range across like, you know, a city square or something, you drop them."
4087.0,4089.0, They might just disappear from the window and you really don't know.
4089.0,4093.0," You have to wait to the end of the round to confirm the kill because, of course, in real life, you're not going to."
4093.0,4099.0," Nothing's going to appear on your goggles that say, the job, you know, so your frag count doesn't go up."
4099.0,4100.0," Yeah, so that's interesting."
4100.0,4110.0," But then, of course, if you're a close range and you see him going down, you know, it's not saying anything, but you know to him well, like that you at the end of the round, you know, it's going to be calculated."
4110.0,4114.0," And again, it's just all about moving as a group, working as a group."
4114.0,4121.0," And it's intense because when you know that that leaf out of these there, and you get to that where you're afraid you're always using the the lean two keys."
4121.0,4125.0," When you're all that's an option and a lot of games, it's an option in Quake Wars."
4125.0,4128.0," I almost never use them here, use them all the time."
4128.0,4139.0," It's extreme caution, different pacing, but even, you know, I haven't played quite in it. I played it for, you know, all last evening, not quite enough to make any kind of really strongly,"
4139.0,4150.0, a value of statements about it. But the interesting thing that I do want to comment is the the strength of the mod scene that it's releases has indicated because downloading this thing was a nightmare.
4150.0,4171.0," I mean, all of file plan at servers are just packed, you know, and that's the problem too, because they will sometimes you know that there, I was going to say I suspect that they're lying with the numbers of people that are queued up, but I know that they're lying because I've had to wait for the most random things that I can assure you there's not another single person in the world and like that, you know,"
4171.0,4184.0," I was saying it makes me wait for 10 minutes, but all the other servers, all the other people, the torrents and every other option, it was just just crazy, just huge weights and then once I got the game installed and you look at the server list, it's like,"
4184.0,4197.0," keep scrolling, keep scrolling, you're like, dammit, it's just going to quit paying servers, no, it's not, it just keeps going and going. And night and day, we just were messing around with call of war is multiplayer in the office the other day and it's like, what, you know, six servers,"
4197.0,4204.0," that we're not based in, you know, tech land servers from Eastern Europe with pains that are over 180."
4204.0,4215.0," Everyone's in their plan talking about it and stuff and it's just cool to see that, you know, the good mods are fewer and farther between, but I mean, there's definitely an audience,"
4215.0,4223.0," I mean, if you took the time, it's, they all really spent all that time, it's paying off now because a lot of people are talking about playing their game."
4223.0,4232.0," So mine's being a desert combat and absolutely, it's a way you're describing it. Right, we're just huge. Yes, so it's good, I don't know, it always makes me happy to see it because you know, like,"
4232.0,4241.0, there have been some really ballsy mods to come out using this engine in the past year and they've just completely lead like vanished into obscurity.
4241.0,4247.0," And that's part of the thing, too, you know, like what I'm describing in search and see how it's, it's fundamentally very simple game."
4247.0,4256.0," It's very straightforward. It's like, hey, you guys, you can choose between these types of firearms and then you basically go out and take some territory and kill the enemy team."
4256.0,4262.0," Then you have something like insects and festation, which is just phenomenally innovative."
4262.0,4272.0," And it's got about like three weeks lifespan before the last server dries up and no one's there anymore, you know, I mean, that's some sort of problem when you get to and even dystopials is really great mod."
4272.0,4282.0," But because of the complexity of it, you know, in the game within a game where, you know, you pick a class that can hack and then you go to a computer terminal and then suddenly you're in cyberspace moving around and doing things there."
4282.0,4287.0," And I think it's prohibited for a lot of people for whatever reason, you know, they should have called that guy shadow run."
4287.0,4301.0," Bring this back, you know, like, yeah, well, it was shadow run, yeah, because, you know, Mitch from fast studio was on the OXM podcast last week or something and just, you know, saying that this is shadow run is,"
4301.0,4311.0," you know, one of the most innovative games ever made and then basically hanging the future of innovation in this space on his game, you know, so say if you guys don't buy this game, that's it, it's done."
4311.0,4326.0," If it's dead, it's dead and you know, I honestly don't know why this guy didn't call him on it when it's like, you know, just just throwing that wasn't even thinking about it, but you know, insects and festation, it's like, there's like a bunch, you know, fair moon trails, deployables the same thing."
4326.0,4333.0," It's just, it's a instead of having creating an over that chases crap down, you create a mushroom that shoots like crazy fungus out and does stuff."
4333.0,4338.0," And even quick words, I mean, there's far more tactical variety in that game."
4338.0,4353.0," And just, just to kind of historical ignorance, it requires to say that anyway, I mean, again, it's like over and over again, but because it is the foundation for all PC shootings team forges, go back to it, at least play that before you start making certain claims,"
4353.0,4358.0," you know, I mean, gliders and stuff, I mean, look at tribes, I mean, all these different things."
4358.0,4371.0," And just to go, I mean, it's like, hey, I totally appreciate everything, you know, that you're doing mentioned it, you're saying, but like, depending on your audience, you know, they're not going to just say, well, it's right, this is it."
4371.0,4382.0," Now, our only option is to just see you guys are, you're, you're choices, you get a game where it takes 30 shots to kill or one shot to kill, and that's it, but it's still basically that you get an M4, you get an AK-47."
4382.0,4404.0," I mean, that's just not the case. I mean, there's still, there's so much stuff going on, and it sucks to see it in any truly innovative game, not perform as well as people would have hoped, you know, but happens all the time, which is a well, that's what I mean, life goes on and people still keep making in really innovative games and now and then they really succeed, you know."
4404.5,4410.0," Right, the shadow on is was a problem for so many reasons that we don't need to go over."
4410.0,4414.0," Yeah, we're getting a lot of training, but but by the way, he did, I'm sorry."
4414.0,4427.0," Right, not just, no, that stuck with me and I did go on, I just wanted to bring that up again, because just to hear some of that stuff just go on answered, it's pretty good point on the PC, the innovation has been going on for a long long time."
4427.0,4433.0," Yeah, and the options for multiplayer shooters have been very deep for years and years now."
4434.0,4448.0," And it's a known and even like, you know, dark Messiah of might magic multiplayer, I mean, almost to the point where there's like a one to one ratio of stuff, the brambles in there, their brambles are just made of organic vines instead of crystals, you know."
4448.0,4456.0," But it is hard, it's like the more complex and you know, innovative, your game is the harder it is to sell most of the time."
4456.0,4459.0, That catch 20 team.
4459.0,4462.0," Yeah, here's the fearing change."
4462.0,4471.0," So what's up Ryan, you got a lot to say, how are you going to do three podcasts, man? You're using up all your good statement."
4471.0,4473.0, Same with himself for the other two.
4473.0,4476.0, And his busy eating is freaking fruit snacks here.
4476.0,4479.0," Ryan, like, yeah, damn you and your fruit snacks."
4479.0,4483.0," At some point, we're going to really Ryan is like, just like an imaginary friend we have."
4483.0,4487.0," We got, we had all these attributes. He likes fruit snacks."
4487.0,4494.0," And because I was just like about to tell the story of you know, when I went to go get my lunch, Ryan, you give me two bucks and you're like, can you give me eight quarters?"
4494.0,4497.0," It's like, why can you get two bags of fruits next?"
4497.0,4498.0," Oh, it's just what you're on now."
4498.0,4499.0, The first next.
4499.0,4500.0, Hell yeah.
4500.0,4502.0," For a while, it was the Rice Crispy Treats."
4502.0,4504.0, They didn't have fruit snacks before.
4504.0,4505.0, So you've switched.
4505.0,4506.0," Yeah, snuff a lot."
4506.0,4511.0," There was a sticker on the machine, which tells about that note you put for the snack guy."
4511.0,4513.0, It said more fruits next please.
4513.0,4518.0, It was in our caps and had exclamation on it though.
4518.0,4521.0, So he finally got like PLC.
4521.0,4523.0," Has he, has he visited us again?"
4523.0,4528.0," Yeah. Oh, I was going to put a note on there that just said, snack guy, why has the foresaken us?"
4528.0,4530.0, Because he's been gone for like two weeks.
4530.0,4531.0, Yeah.
4531.0,4532.0, The machine's been empty.
4532.0,4533.0, Everything was vacant.
4533.0,4534.0," And we've seen, guys."
4534.0,4536.0," And the, the machine guy, if you're listening to this."
4536.0,4537.0, Here's to you.
4537.0,4539.0, The snack machine is not taking dollars.
4539.0,4540.0, It's only taking change.
4540.0,4541.0, That's still.
4541.0,4544.0," If you could just please fix that, we don't need to be happy."
4544.0,4545.0," Yeah, I'm sure he's listening."
4545.0,4548.0," Hey, you know."
4548.0,4549.0, And ever how we do it on time?
4549.0,4551.0, We talk about some of our E3 predictions.
4551.0,4553.0, We haven't done any E3 predictions.
4553.0,4554.0, So we read.
4554.0,4556.0, I predicted it's going to suck balls.
4556.0,4557.0, Yeah.
4557.0,4559.0, I predicted you were going to say that.
4559.0,4560.0, You're going to say that.
4560.0,4561.0, You're going to find.
4561.0,4562.0, Yeah.
4562.0,4563.0, Okay. What if I said it's going to be correct?
4563.0,4564.0, I predicted.
4564.0,4565.0, You hope you did you're going to see that.
4565.0,4566.0, That's good.
4566.0,4568.0, I'm going to say that.
4569.0,4570.0, I'm going to say that.
4570.0,4571.0, I'm going to say that.
4571.0,4572.0, I'm going to say that.
4572.0,4574.0, I'm going to be hating.
4574.0,4575.0, I'm going to say.
4575.0,4576.0," Well, no."
4576.0,4577.0," There's, I mean, I don't want to know."
4577.0,4579.0, What's going to be game of the show?
4579.0,4580.0, No.
4580.0,4581.0, But come on.
4581.0,4584.0," It's like, what are we going to see is it going to wheel out their, you know,"
4584.0,4586.0, Carmax new game?
4586.0,4588.0," Are we going to, you know,"
4588.0,4591.0," a sport going to, we're going to find out it's not coming out to 2009."
4591.0,4592.0, What about other surprises?
4592.0,4593.0," You know, whatever."
4593.0,4594.0," I'm like, hey."
4594.0,4596.0," I don't even, who's going to be there?"
4596.0,4597.0, I don't even know.
4597.0,4599.0, It's such a hate or maybe it's a down.
4599.0,4600.0, I'm sorry.
4600.0,4601.0, I actually don't the one.
4601.0,4602.0, I love it.
4602.0,4603.0, That better.
4603.0,4605.0, I can't wait.
4605.0,4607.0," No, you know, I'm going to show a boot page there."
4607.0,4608.0, I don't know.
4608.0,4610.0, I don't think the number of like new announcements is going to be.
4610.0,4611.0, You're going to be.
4611.0,4612.0, Yeah.
4612.0,4614.0, My predictions is that this is the end of E3.
4614.0,4617.0, You think we're going to get back from this and everything.
4617.0,4618.0, I don't think so.
4618.0,4620.0, In this age when like a billion shows.
4620.0,4623.0," I mean, you know, the, I'm trying to do this without name and names."
4623.0,4628.0," But just basically where mass media conglomerates or owning all games, coverage and stuff."
4628.0,4630.0," This stuff is perfect for it, you know."
4630.0,4631.0, I'd rather go back to the old one.
4631.0,4632.0, We got that notice today about.
4632.0,4634.0, There's other stuff say that about another.
4634.0,4641.0," What we understand as a, as a, to be play the function of the press offering to inform."
4641.0,4642.0, That's right.
4642.0,4644.0, And everyone else about what was going on.
4644.0,4645.0," Yeah, we miss it."
4645.0,4646.0," You know, that's right."
4646.0,4649.0," This kind of environment is, is absolutely ideal."
4649.0,4652.0," I think for for peddling controlled messages and for, and to the"
4652.0,4657.0," maximum number of, you know, just getting it everywhere and over and over and over."
4657.0,4660.0," I mean, just rather go back to the old success, you know."
4660.0,4662.0," Well, yeah, the thing is like, we'll see me on."
4662.0,4665.0," We, we're all saying, oh, man, this is going to suck because it's spread out."
4665.0,4668.0, I'll across the city and think about market.
4668.0,4669.0, You work it now.
4669.0,4673.0," Yeah, if you're looking at it from like, okay, the consumers getting the message."
4673.0,4676.0," Yeah, then suddenly, you know, the cares what we think about it."
4676.0,4677.0, You're right.
4677.0,4678.0, It's only a pain in the ass.
4678.0,4681.0," Well, you know, every industry person we've talked to the two, right?"
4681.0,4686.0," Like you and I, yes, Sean and I yesterday were on a trip that we have to wait to talk about,"
4686.0,4687.0, but they were all bitching about E3.
4687.0,4689.0, This was the developers.
4689.0,4690.0," They were all bitching about it, too."
4690.0,4693.0, They all bitch about it anyway.
4693.0,4694.0, They always have.
4694.0,4695.0, Yeah.
4695.0,4697.0, They always have this year in particular.
4697.0,4698.0, They're saying they don't get it either.
4698.0,4699.0," No, but it gets it."
4699.0,4700.0, But it's still happening.
4700.0,4701.0, It is still happening.
4701.0,4703.0," And there will still be, and we'll be there to cover it in."
4703.0,4705.0, I don't see quite a while.
4705.0,4708.0, I honestly don't know why we don't get what's there not to get.
4708.0,4714.0," It's like, okay, before you have a massive, it's like before if you're going to a casino, right?"
4714.0,4716.0," It's like, you're as a developer or something."
4716.0,4718.0, You've got one of the slot machines in there.
4718.0,4719.0, Okay.
4719.0,4723.0," And you're competing against, and you have people that go in and write about slot machines for a living"
4723.0,4724.0, come in.
4724.0,4725.0, Right.
4725.0,4729.0," There's a billion lights and sounds and people rub in them, rub in the screens and people who, like,"
4729.0,4734.0," think they're on a streak and are too lazy to get up and take a piss, so they pee in their pants on the, on the stew."
4734.0,4736.0," So,"
4736.0,4739.0, you're going to put your thing.
4739.0,4741.0, I have a friend that works in the casino.
4741.0,4744.0," Sorry, so I'm actually rolled to do so out there pant like,"
4744.0,4745.0," Oh, come on."
4745.0,4747.0," But, no, that's real."
4747.0,4749.0," It's face, so terrified."
4749.0,4750.0," He's like, turning green."
4750.0,4751.0, True that they did.
4751.0,4752.0, Okay.
4752.0,4756.0," So, or do you want to have an environment where you've got your own, like, you know, whatever"
4756.0,4762.0, brand X slot machines and you can guarantee that every one of those people that writes about
4762.0,4768.0, these is going to come into your tent and you've got their undivided attention for a specified amount of time.
4768.0,4772.0," Not only that, you can have a, you have, like, a press conference before you show them the machine."
4772.0,4778.0," You talk about the machine for an hour, then you sit them down in the machine, get a drinks, make them play it, you know."
4778.0,4779.0," I mean, what's better?"
4779.0,4780.0," It's like, no brain."
4780.0,4781.0, You're right.
4781.0,4783.0, That's that from there from the publishers perspective.
4783.0,4785.0," So, we don't understand what's going on."
4785.0,4787.0, I think that's just fall.
4787.0,4788.0, Right.
4788.0,4789.0, We understand what's going on.
4790.0,4797.0," Well, I mean, I think you could accomplish that without spreading it to like, because it's in like 14 different hotels or something."
4797.0,4801.0," Right. I mean, we're talking very, we're talking very insider stuff here."
4801.0,4805.0," If you're listening and you don't know, we're going to this gaming convention next week."
4805.0,4807.0, It's E3 for years and years and years.
4807.0,4818.0," It's been held in, you know, a giant convention center in LA, where all the game companies are showing their stuff under one in one huge room or in a couple of huge rooms, whatever."
4818.0,4826.0," And every, I guess you can't really say all things are equal there because some companies are spending like tens of millions of dollars on giant booths and other stuff."
4826.0,4828.0," Little booths, but basically we're on your one roof."
4828.0,4831.0, Now this year that I'll got canceled.
4831.0,4837.0, It's in Santa Monica and it's spread out over a whole bunch of different hotels over.
4837.0,4840.0," I don't know how, what's the range of few miles?"
4840.0,4841.0, It's quite a big space.
4841.0,4846.0, It's been involved a bunch of us like being in cabs and cars to go from one thing to the other.
4846.0,4848.0, So that's the pain that we're talking about.
4848.0,4854.0," At the same time, we have complaining the past about the show being so much of a circus that."
4854.0,4859.0," Even as the people who are shit in our pants on the slot machines, you know, we're."
4859.0,4861.0," Sorry, that's one."
4861.0,4863.0, It's one hit to get all quiet for minutes.
4863.0,4868.0," So as those people, we can have a closer more intimate look at the stuff."
4868.0,4869.0," And then because, you know, we're there."
4869.0,4870.0, We're in the easiest press.
4870.0,4871.0, We're enthusiastic to see it.
4871.0,4874.0, But we have like a more sane.
4874.0,4878.0," Although it's going to be a much and even more me even, you know, great as a circumstance of greater"
4878.0,4883.0," Mediation, but a more sane environment to sort of absorb what's going on at talk to the developer."
4883.0,4885.0, What are you doing with this? What's the goal and this and that?
4885.0,4886.0, So that's going to work for us.
4886.0,4887.0, It's moving around.
4887.0,4895.0, The thing that I question though is when I've seen some people say that this is just going to be better for it better than ever for smaller.
4895.0,4896.0," Oh, the less."
4896.0,4897.0," Yeah, and the less."
4897.0,4898.0, The shit obvious developers.
4898.0,4899.0," Oh, there's no way."
4899.0,4902.0," Yeah, you know, people have actually, you know, posted that in stories online."
4902.0,4910.0," And it's just cracked me up because it's like, you know, now are you going to take a 20 dollar cab to the fucking motel six to go see their game."
4910.0,4911.0, Of course not.
4911.0,4917.0," Or you more likely to go down stairs to Kentia Hall and see a whole bunch of stuff when it's actually becomes great because it's, right?"
4917.0,4919.0, It's like the mad science works.
4919.0,4920.0," Well, there's no stuff."
4920.0,4924.0," You know, it's stealing your analogy from like, you know, the slot machines like for me every year."
4924.0,4930.0," I mean, I was the jackass roaming with Jack and Coke and looking for the slot machine in the far corner that no one else was playing."
4930.0,4933.0," And I'm like, I've ever done you heard it at good payouts."
4933.0,4934.0," Yeah, exactly."
4934.0,4936.0, Every day it was a loose slot.
4936.0,4939.0, You're all about the loose slots.
4939.0,4943.0," So anyway, so get it."
4943.0,4953.0," Every year, like I would shut appointments on the main floor to go specifically to Kentia Hall because that's where you find all the really innovative cool stuff."
4953.0,4954.0, And it's.
4955.0,4956.0, I don't know about that.
4956.0,4958.0, Because there's a lot of stuff.
4958.0,4963.0," There's the problem with like, you when you deify the little guy doing extent, then you get like,"
4963.0,4969.0, I'm going to say everything's top and vendor and every piece of shit that we loud on there that you're going to say better than like whatever like GM events.
4969.0,4971.0, And that's the end of the point is taken.
4971.0,4975.0," I'm not saying it's gold, but I'm saying that a lot of like basically a lot of the games like say like,"
4975.0,4978.0, I'll too sure of the things of the world we're first seeing there.
4978.0,4979.0," Yeah, right."
4979.0,4981.0, And so it's do consistently seeing there exactly.
4981.0,4988.0," So I mean, that's all my point and like, and you're exactly right, who's going to want to like take some 20 dollar cab ride to whatever."
4988.0,4992.0, And because I have to have the time you wouldn't even know it existed and see a shot.
4992.0,4994.0, This was just about the big guy really.
4994.0,4995.0," Yeah, make no mistake."
4995.0,5001.0," I mean, they're still going to be spending as many dollars as ever to compete for our attention and to create the most favorable impression in every."
5001.0,5004.0, But there's way that they with every means they have it.
5004.0,5005.0, They're disposal.
5005.0,5009.0," So if you've got if you're a money company, I mean, you've got that you."
5009.0,5018.0," It's not like the playing fields in the level of all of a sudden, you know, everyone agreed like some kind of arms rates where you can spend no more than $10,000 on your entire shindig."
5018.0,5020.0," Right, your presentation."
5020.0,5023.0, You all agreed to use the exact same type of monitors or anything.
5023.0,5025.0," It's like, I mean, yeah, those other guys are just going to be."
5025.0,5028.0," I mean, there's going to be stuff you're going to hear about game cocking all that."
5028.0,5032.0," Yeah, but they're not going to hear about the sub game cock guys are going to even further marginalize."
5032.0,5033.0," Yeah, totally."
5033.0,5038.0, So that's what pisses me off because like these guys were like banking everything on someone seeing their stuff and like getting out there.
5038.0,5039.0, Right.
5039.0,5046.0," And so much of E3 every year for us was about what are the games, whether they were bigger small, sometimes they would be the little guys, but sometimes they'd be the big guys."
5046.0,5050.0," But it'd be about what are the games that everybody's talking about, right?"
5050.0,5057.0," And and that was all, you know, being under the same tent and it would always be one or two or three that would be a total surprise."
5057.0,5061.0," You know, you go into the show and not expecting it and then I'll suddenly everybody's talking about O'Kami."
5061.0,5063.0, That's what it was one year.
5063.0,5064.0, How is it going to happen this year?
5064.0,5066.0, If we're all just wandering around from fucking hell.
5066.0,5068.0, We don't really start with the group save.
5068.0,5072.0, So the Zif Davis crew will all be at the same hotel and we'll be hanging out and talking about it.
5072.0,5078.0," You know, the game's about guys will be at their hotel and talking about it and I gen and everyone, you know, the game from a guys will be together."
5078.0,5084.0, So it just won't be like some mass hurt that how often the opportunity to actually go see whatever surprise there is.
5084.0,5086.0, If you already have an arranged for it is going to be a lot harder.
5086.0,5087.0, Right.
5087.0,5090.0, That's a lot of things like you can't right.
5090.0,5095.0," We're getting these emails now that like if you haven't made an appointment yet to see our game, well, you're just not going to get in."
5095.0,5096.0, Yeah.
5096.0,5097.0, So okay. Well great.
5097.0,5099.0, So then we won't see it by.
5099.0,5101.0," I mean, you know, in the old days."
5101.0,5103.0, In the old days.
5103.0,5105.0, You could just go wander up whenever and see the game.
5105.0,5110.0," And we have to say there's probably people there, especially if other people in the story listening that work online."
5110.0,5112.0," They're probably like, you know, these these dikes."
5112.0,5114.0, Like they don't know how good they got it.
5114.0,5118.0," But because yeah, if we weren't there, really, if we wouldn't not be in a position to say,"
5118.0,5120.0," well, screw that about anything."
5120.0,5122.0," We would have to be like, well, we've got to get that story yet."
5122.0,5126.0, We have to get every single story up that they're possibly as to do here and we'd have to do it.
5126.0,5128.0, We're in it because we're afraid with finite pages.
5128.0,5131.0," We do have this awesome position of saying,"
5131.0,5135.0, Since we only have enough to run the stuff we're most interested about anyway.
5135.0,5136.0, Yeah.
5136.0,5137.0, We're going to make it hard.
5137.0,5138.0, I'm interested.
5138.0,5139.0, Yeah.
5139.0,5140.0, Right.
5140.0,5141.0, I should say our counterparts here at.
5141.0,5142.0, Yeah.
5142.0,5143.0, We're going to be doing long work.
5143.0,5144.0, We're going to be doing it for them to.
5144.0,5145.0, Right.
5145.0,5147.0, A bunch of our a bunch of the online coverage is being done by us.
5147.0,5148.0," So I'm being, I'm being over."
5148.0,5150.0, That's when everyone's going to come back and rip us.
5151.0,5152.0, Yeah.
5152.0,5155.0, You want to see what it's like to write something to 15 minutes like two a.m.
5155.0,5158.0, Like we'll see how good your English is right.
5158.0,5160.0, The free review don't count.
5160.0,5161.0, Yeah.
5161.0,5163.0, The free preview's don't count.

5236.0,5238.0, E3 at down in LA.
5238.0,5239.0, And I think we're very.

5244.0,5246.0," If we can get them around too, I have like,"
5246.0,5248.0," already some developers would love to, you know,"
