19.48,20.48, every time you play.
20.48,29.68," Hello, hello. Attention. If you can hear this, please do not turn this off. My name is"
29.72,38.480000000000004, Dr. Norbert Jesty. I'm a scientist. I am recording this from the year 2152. And we have
38.480000000000004,50.68," made an important discovery. We've discovered a tape here. It's labeled GFW Radio June 12, 2007."
50.68,56.120000000000005, And we believe that it holds the key to fixing everything that's gone wrong in the world
56.12,63.12," for the last 100 years. It was on this day on June 12, 2007 that everything went wrong."
63.12,72.36, That's when the month is came. It's when the dinosaurs came back. It's when everything
72.36,78.28, terrible that's happened to everybody's skin. And so this is what we're doing. This is our
78.28,84.2, desperate attempt. What we're planning on doing my robot friend and I is we're going
84.2,89.2, to take this tape. We're going to use the time machine that we've built. And we're going
89.2,95.92, to go back. We're going to go back and post this in hopes that once it's up and people
95.92,103.88," can hear this podcast now that they'd couldn't before, but it will fix everything. We want"
103.88,110.60000000000001," who we want things to be the way they were before. We want our skin back. The please, if"
110.6,117.96," you're listening to this in 2007, please, it's going to sound odd. It sounds like somehow"
117.96,121.03999999999999, this was in the middle of the podcast. The whole thing isn't here anywhere. We don't know
121.03999999999999,126.24, what happened now. It's 100 years later. But just listen to what's here now. And maybe
126.24,131.56," if you listen to this small excerpt of this lost podcast, the world can once again be the"
131.56,137.48," way it was meant to be. Please forgot to say, listen to this out there. Good luck and"
137.48,147.16," watch DTWall. We can manage it on. So after an equipment malfunction, we don't know where"
147.16,151.35999999999999," we're at. We're going to back this shit up a little bit. We're going to jack you know,"
151.35999999999999,156.51999999999998, we had time to go difficult these are new laptop. Let's just go on. We'll move on to another
156.51999999999998,162.88, question. That. Okay. This is a good one. I think it's scaried 83 s to what extent do we
162.88,168.32, think that RPG gameplay elements getting levels increasing stats and abilities and upgrading
168.32,173.44, equipment are fundamental part of the massive multiplayer experience. It's hard to imagine
173.44,176.79999999999998," an MMO where people don't have some sort of increasing abilities throughout the game,"
176.79999999999998,180.76, but at the same time people have been enjoying counter strike and hail for years and nobody's
180.76,184.88, found an epic shotgun or leveled up their hit points. So once broadband technologies
184.88,188.68," and after handling it, you think that pure action gameplay will translate to a persistent"
188.76000000000002,195.16, unified online world or action MMO is going to always rely on instant combat and stat tracking
195.16,199.16, where the people fundamentally need some sort of levels that justify the time they put into the
199.16,203.64000000000001, game. Short are MMO's fundamentally tied to RPG gameplay elements.
203.64000000000001,211.0," Huh. I would like the first thing that comes to mind for me, maybe to get started,"
211.0,217.4," who is that I don't think it's so much. Well, especially now, as we're seeing games like"
217.4,223.56, or we're hearing about games like Huxley and the crossing and just basically all you have
223.56,228.92000000000002," complaints side, all these new versions of multiple massive multiplayer environments and stuff."
228.92000000000002,235.32, It's not so much the technology the bandwidth as the design of MMOs as they are now reflects
235.32,241.08, just the time. The man hours that people are able and willing to put in into designing gameplay
241.16000000000003,247.16000000000003, more and the best way to keep people playing or to create a ton of content is to create
247.96,253.24," basically level. It does the same content, change the colors on it, add some new items and"
253.24,258.44, basically change the names by saying you're a different level now and by saying that the
258.44,263.56," scar is art is now red scar is art or whatever. Yeah, levels and stats are a way to like"
263.56,267.40000000000003, tell you where you're supposed to be currently in the game. So if you got like the
268.2,272.84," best giant world, allegedly, if you're level 12, you're allowed to be in this chunk of the"
272.84,279.88, best giant world. Right. And instead of saying what we're going to spend a hundred thousand hours
279.88,283.96," making a game that you could play for a thousand hours, they're still going to spend in however many"
283.96,288.12, hours they did but find a way to make it so that what they made is going to last you.
289.15999999999997,292.35999999999996, It's different. I'm not saying it's going to make the same game but I find them in the
292.36,295.08000000000004," game. I mean, this is this is basically, I don't think it's controversial. The way and the"
295.08000000000004,300.04, most are designed that reflects the need to have to keep people playing and to have a bunch of
300.04,305.08000000000004, content and you can't do that by being a specialist. You have to be a generalist and just say
305.08000000000004,310.36, we could take different backgrounds and stuff but this this fundamental experience of going up and
310.36,314.92, clicking on things has got to work the way it is. You're not going to have the variety of like
314.92,321.0," of what you'd experience over the course of half life too. Every time you play this game,"
321.0,325.0, day and a day out for the course of a year so that you've got a thousand hours each as unique
325.0,331.0, as every hour and half life too. I just think there's going to always be both kind of games
331.0,337.96, because really they just can appeal to not just different gamers but people who maybe like
337.96,343.88," both but want to play a different kind of game at a different time. I don't think I mean, yeah,"
343.88,349.96, there's part of the reason that there haven't been good action based MMOs has been technology
350.03999999999996,354.59999999999997," in bandwidth and everything but even if you make all that equal, I think you're still going to get"
354.59999999999997,362.28," people who would still rather just prefer a level grind over a cheetah mob, right? Or if it"
362.28,368.03999999999996," rather than a cheetah mob like say what if the combat were, even as engaging as devil may cry or"
368.03999999999996,372.44," take it down an inch from that and say, it's like, God, a war or something. That I think maybe that's"
372.44,376.35999999999996," even too demanding for some people who really want to just be in there and spend, because you're"
376.44,380.6, not going to be having an elaborate talk with your your guild mates and stuff if you're like
380.6,384.44," worrying about hitting your right combos at the right time, precisely the right time. I know"
384.44,388.76, that that need exists in high level play and in rating and stuff like that and the world of
388.76,395.64," workcraft specifically but for most instances, pre rating stuff, it sounds like you can just go in"
395.64,400.2, and we could talk about what we want on pizza at the home of the best pizza in the world or
400.2,405.8," still kill like whatever red scars are. Yeah, that's pretty safe."
405.8,410.44," I think to say that if you're playing with more than one person in a while, like it's a"
411.40000000000003,417.48," super easy game. Like, because most of the game is tuned for one person in the hand also. You've got"
417.48,425.24," two people doing the same stuff and really don't pick deal. Yeah, more questions. Ryan, do you want to"
425.56,440.92," yeah, read some read? I'm looking. I can't decide pick one. Hard for a dart."
442.28000000000003,447.8," This one are here, um, smile. See, it's news and news. Damn it. This says there are least three"
447.8,451.88," games being made in movies for releases fault. Dungeon C, Chipman, opposed to it with"
451.96,458.2, there's one game with the story that practically cries out to be filmed. Zelda? Half life. Is
458.2,462.84," there? Or has there been any talk about making a Half Life movie? Also, if you're going to cast"
462.84,469.32," the major roles in the film, who would you cast? So the last I heard from Gabe Newell at Valve"
469.32,473.8," is that of course they had been approached by, you know, from multiple angles about making a Half"
473.8,481.08," Life movie. But obviously they're very, very picky with their baby and what happens to it and nothing"
481.15999999999997,486.84," has impressed them and the least bit there. So as of that talk a year ago, there's definitely nothing"
486.84,492.28," in the work in the work. So although they have those discussions clearly, I mean, you have a"
492.28,496.28," property like that you're going to be having this discussion. Yeah. Well, two of those games that are"
496.28,502.28, released for a you-ey-bowl production. But they hardly count. Aren't all three of them? Who's the
502.84,508.44," of a baby is he? I don't think so. Man, why would you want to see a movie of any of these?"
508.44,513.8, Including had life. I wouldn't even want to say a Half Life movie. That'd be like nerd. I kind of
513.8,519.16," would. It'd be like doom. I mean, like the parts of thrill. There's a lot more to have fun."
519.16,523.24," There's a lot more to have fun. Okay, that's not a fair comparison because Half Life did have a great"
523.24,528.92, story and does have a great story and it has a cool universe. But we've experienced it already
529.3199999999999,532.68," in the game as Gordon Freeman. It's all about the extended experience,"
532.68,535.9599999999999," help Jeff. And if you're not watching reading the Heroes comic strips,"
535.9599999999999,541.88," I think you're not. Okay. So let's cast Gordon Freeman. Yeah. Jack,"
542.68,548.92," Ryan, Ryan Scott. Ryan Scott. Ryan Scott has gone to the room. Yeah, Jack,"
551.3199999999999,556.4399999999999," I was like, yeah. What would be the game would he be? Good fit for."
556.7600000000001,561.0," Yeah, why? Looker man. Jack, I took him."
562.12,566.9200000000001," So he should be in a whole video game movie. Yeah, because he knows he'd understand."
568.12,572.36," No, who what? They asked us a question. Who's the gameman? I don't know."
572.36,576.6800000000001, Whether gaming ultimate gaming authority. Because general don't spend my time thinking about
577.4000000000001,579.48," you know, we need to be wonderful. Edward, Norton."
580.36,582.2800000000001, That's not bad. That's not bad. That's not bad. That's not bad. That's not bad.
582.28,585.8, We're pretty pretty good. There you go. There's guy I used to work with.
585.8,590.52," Lookin perfect. Oh great. Oh, okay. It's Patrick. That he meant. No,"
590.52,594.0799999999999, sorry. Cast like he said art director over a future. He was more
594.0799999999999,600.52," freeman for Eli Vance. You know, and yeah, sure. How about the"
600.52,606.76," Alex. Yeah, Alex. Michelle Rodriguez. What?"
606.84,611.64," Oh, God. That would be bad. Jeff, you're like,"
612.84,615.72, just keep going. I guess you're all so. All right.
615.72,616.92, I got to get that. I got to get that. I got to get that. I got to get that. I got to get that.
616.92,619.16, I got to get that. I got to get that. I got to get that. I got to get that. I got to get that.
619.16,623.8, Yeah. Michelle Rodriguez is Alex. And what's what's her dad same? What's his name?
623.8,627.88," We got, well, what? Go for Bart. He's the one you said was that. Oh, yeah. That's, uh,"
629.08,632.92," yeah, but that's in your cast. In mine, it's, uh,"
633.88,636.5999999999999," wait, you said, no, I didn't say, bar said, you got to cast,"
636.5999999999999,640.4399999999999," Barney. I didn't cast Barney yet. No, but you cast and Morgan Freeman is what's his name?"
640.4399999999999,646.12," Yeah. Yeah. But in my version, the part played by Morgan Freeman is played by, um,"
648.28,655.64," the guy who played, uh, uh, uh, uh, Raymond and everybody loves Raymond's brother. That"
655.64,661.7199999999999," baked it. Over what? Okay. I didn't. Well, take this somewhere quick. And you're"
661.72,665.32, okay. All right. I'm in the hot seat. So Barney. Yeah.
665.32,672.76," Uh, uh, a Barney is, um, what's his name? Uh, Conan O'Brien's ex-sidekick Andy Rickman. Andy Rickman."
672.76,678.0400000000001," Rickman, not what he did. Oh, the ready. Those people are shit. All right. And some move on."
679.24,684.52, This sounds like a winner. This is why I'm not a casting protecting the box office right now.
685.16,689.96," Um, I was kidding about all those."
689.96,695.24," Oh, yeah. You. Uh, don't lie. What part here? Yeah. This is from atomic"
695.24,699.72, satchel. What criteria is used when sending a staff member to check out a game? Would you
699.72,705.0, rather send the hardcore fan of the genre or someone completely new or neutral? I'm
705.0,709.0, thinking there are benefits and downsides either way. So in really into the games of a
709.0,712.36," specific type might get caught up in height, on the other hand, a new camera to the"
713.32,715.8000000000001, generator might not appreciate or understand what the developers are trying to do.
717.16,720.92, I guess could be another this man or send whoever has the availability to go.
721.64,725.4, I think he just answered that. I think he's a person all the way throughout that. Very personal.
725.4,731.0," Very perceptive question. No, very nobody looked at the that is always a we deal with those"
731.0,735.8000000000001," are mistakes. That's part of what we deal with. If someone is is too far into something,"
736.52,742.52," there is that danger that they're, you know, I mean in cases, I guess I deal in cases like that."
742.52,747.8," Now, and then we will we will work together stories, you know, and you have different perspectives"
747.8,754.04," stuff. But I mean, it is. Yeah, it's given take like you said. If you send me cover or like to"
754.04,758.68," take it away from me, if you send either you Jeff or Sean Maloy, cover Rutherwell, the workcraft,"
758.68,763.7199999999999, you're getting the perspective of people that know the game very well and are going to be
764.36,768.36," asking a different set of questions. They're going to be asking, I think the sorts of questions that"
768.36,773.1600000000001, other people that are really into the game and other people that are going to buy the magazine
773.1600000000001,778.52," based on that cover story are going to want to have asked. Right. At the same time though,"
778.52,783.0," and it does work together way where, you know, like Sean, you had this experience recently writing about"
783.0,789.0," team fortress 2, where you do go and you're in a writing about it and you're asking an entirely"
789.0,792.6800000000001," different set of questions. And like, you know, when you came back from your visit, I was asking all the"
792.76,795.88," stuff. Well, what about this, and this? Right. It's a really specific way. I really"
795.88,800.92," can't understand that. But then you, but you were able to offer a completely valuable perspective"
801.64,806.04, for everyone else that's not me who isn't sitting there doing like old conk map jumps and
806.04,809.88," stuff waiting and thinking about what it's going to be like to play this game. You know, and"
809.88,815.8," both are valid. They obviously want both, I mean, you're a dancer for who the game maker wants"
815.8,820.76, us as audience. It's always everybody. Everybody. Yeah. Right. I just think it's safe to say that that
820.84,825.3199999999999, we approach this question no matter what the article is whether it's a preview or a review or
825.3199999999999,829.64," whatever, right? We're thinking about that a lot. You know, these decisions are never made"
829.64,834.28," lightly. And there's the editorial process, which is always important. You know, I mean,"
834.28,839.56," if ever there's a case in someone comes back, you know, like now rather than the cover story,"
839.56,843.56," then I'll say, you know, if I'm adding a preview or any other story, and it's something seems"
843.56,848.2," too uniform with glowing or positive. It's not like, hey, go and make this like negative, but it's like,"
849.1600000000001,854.36, are you considering these? Are you like considering these options and stuff? We always go back and
854.36,858.2800000000001, ask follow up questions or something or someone or just it could come from anyone. Someone might
858.2800000000001,862.44, have another great question and through the edit process that goes back for another round and
862.44,865.8000000000001," you have that and it adds, you know, that perspective ends up even though it's still in the"
865.8000000000001,871.0," voice of the one writer who wrote it, you know, it's introduced into that way. But never any,"
871.0,875.48," it's meant to feel fortunate here. I mean, because of our sort of, you know, our epic here"
875.48,879.8000000000001," in the way that we do things and we have, you know, we have meetings and stuff and through email,"
879.8000000000001,885.5600000000001," we talk about, you know, and it launches and stuff. This is how these are expectations. We don't want"
885.5600000000001,889.24," to see this kind of thing. We think that this defines us, you know, these other practices"
890.04,895.5600000000001," we just don't want to have here. And so we just don't see that kind of thing or someone is entirely,"
895.5600000000001,900.76, I don't think we had that or someone's entirely blinded by something and their appreciation
900.84,905.88, for it to the extent that they're coming back a year away or a year or two away from releasing
905.88,910.12," and saying that something is a potential game of the year, contender, you know, well, I think when"
910.12,914.68," these things do crop up and I agree with you, I don't think we're that bad, but I think when they do"
914.68,920.68," crop up in articles as we're going through the editing process, somebody else here on staff will"
920.68,924.92," call them on it. Yeah, yeah. In this case, it's worth, I mean, yeah, there are stories that by the time"
924.92,929.96," they do go to readers, they've gone through, you know, four or five passes and the entire rewrite"
930.0400000000001,936.0400000000001," of times, you know, and say like really think that we could be a little more critical, that my"
936.0400000000001,942.2800000000001," critical, we don't mean just being negative, you know, but by again, I mean at the very bare minimum,"
942.2800000000001,948.2800000000001," you have to ask the questions that you think with the degree of health, the normal skepticism,"
948.2800000000001,953.32, any non-do is going to have. And if you ever have someone reading your book and they're asking
953.32,957.0," questions like, why didn't I help they didn't they ask them this, you know, as it seems so obvious,"
957.08,962.52," like then you kind of fucked up, you know. So let's move on to either before we dwell on that too long."
964.76,968.2," We'll go on to some other. We have, uh,"
971.4,977.24," GFW radio crew, this is Tempest 261, serious question. When you guys please stop mumbling,"
977.24,983.88," I always hear the first half of your second half, Shama Williams, Jeff, or the next one."
984.12,987.88," This is for this and to the podcast while driving, if you don't believe me,"
989.88,994.12," all right, whatever, we got another letter. So they say, I'm, I'm a member."
994.76,999.48," I will talk like this from Dala. That was a real letter and I wanted to say,"
999.48,1005.4," your name, I've guided you, you've got to stand up to it. Okay. I don't mumbling if you think so about you."
1005.96,1009.48," Here's one, I think we could cover this quickly, but it's worth reading this question because"
1009.48,1017.96," he makes us on point. I think it's a good one. Uh, LMN8R, the LMemic. Do you think people vastly"
1017.96,1023.72," exaggerate the cost of PC gaming? In my opinion they do. We've got a 360 and safe 400-yard console,"
1023.72,1029.08," turn around and say $2,000 PC completely ignoring one. Back at TVs aren't free,"
1029.08,1034.1200000000001," especially, of course, high definition of stuff. You know, to PCs are used for much more than just games"
1034.1200000000001,1039.08," three upgrading a non-gaming PC to one capable of gaming, usually when we require the addition,"
1039.56,1043.8," of a $200, $300 video card. And of course, that depends on what you're working with there."
1045.64,1049.4," You guys want to try and, man, I just say, yeah, that's a point I make constantly, especially"
1049.4,1053.8," that now, now that we've made the HD jump and I go over to like, you know, you go over to"
1053.8,1059.64," shoes house or mark a down to something. We've got these Mongo HD TVs. On the TV world, I saw,"
1059.64,1063.88," I still got a, you know, like around in the front, you know, the name for those anymore. If you think that's"
1063.88,1069.5600000000002," like a, you've got a CRT. DCR built into it. Yeah. And for the audio, there's like one plug,"
1069.5600000000002,1074.2800000000002," you know, like even when you're using the two, like this is the stereo plug. Do you have the,"
1074.2800000000002,1078.44," the wire hanger in tenants still sticking out? I could not, I did have that for a while"
1078.44,1083.64," until like, go for an 1-in cable. We have cable TV for like seven years. We had to do that."
1083.64,1089.3200000000002," And we had to turn the turn to channel, the manual channel with the other wrench. Nice. That's a thing,"
1089.3999999999999,1099.8, so off. Yeah. Yeah. Really nice computer. That's the same. I think the computer does more than play games.
1099.8,1104.84," Our game is the most solid there. This, like, yeah, I've been using it for a lot more than just"
1104.84,1111.6399999999999," F like two. Play music on your PS3, but you're not necessarily using all that power that you're"
1111.6399999999999,1119.24," paying for the quad core and for the, you know, two gigs of ram and stuff."
1119.24,1125.48, To buy some shit off I to right. I've never gotten that into PC gaming that I needed to buy all the
1125.48,1129.56, expensive stuff. I just can't afford it. So I'm pretty modest every time I buy a computer anyway.
1130.92,1136.6, The thing is is getting used also getting used to not just accepting that you're not going to have
1136.92,1142.6," the optimum settings for every game that comes out. You know, I can play so many games on sub-optimum setting."
1142.6,1146.6," Yeah, just get used to it. It doesn't matter. Like, yeah, I'm not going to love that. That's a matter."
1146.6,1150.1999999999998," You know, yeah, if I need to see something look really good, I just go into Darren's office."
1150.9199999999998,1156.52," Yeah, so that's what that looks like. Cool. I mean, a big concern for me is if it plays on my laptop."
1157.6399999999999,1158.52," Right, honestly."
1162.04,1164.4399999999998, We have Doc Martin abortion.
1166.4399999999998,1170.6799999999998," The hell happened to the non gaming podcast. Hey, did that on a couple of other episodes ago."
1171.32,1175.6399999999999," I think you got it today for the first half. You talk a lot about Walmart for you,"
1175.64,1181.24, everybody. And what ever it would have purple water better in the very quick.
1182.44,1183.48," Yeah, that was a joke."
1186.2,1192.3600000000001," The non gaming podcast. Oh, that's it. It was. How many said that enough times now on the boards?"
1192.3600000000001,1196.92, But they're still working with the posting. We were asking for the URL where they can get it.
1196.92,1202.44," Well, there's search for it. This is kind of the non gaming podcast as well as the podcast and ones."
1202.44,1204.8400000000001," It's yeah, we don't have time for more than that a week."
1206.8400000000001,1211.72, Ryan got it in for I have one to take us out on if you've got a Ryan it's still a chance.
1212.76,1213.56, Can't for a wife.
1217.0,1217.96, Let's just a little bit.
1218.8400000000001,1219.96," No, you got a question."
1220.52,1224.6000000000001, We had a question. He read all the good ones. I got I got most of the same ones.
1225.56,1227.56, Here's here's one from from Colonel T.
1228.52,1234.2, I don't know if we've talked about this on previous podcast before or what but he asks how do people
1234.2,1238.84, generally react when you tell them what you do for a living? I would imagine parents often tell you.
1238.84,1242.36," Oh my, so it'd be really good at your job. We love those video games."
1242.36,1247.32, You didn't want to smack the parent. I would want to smack the parent. Have you ever beat up someone
1247.32,1252.36, for asking you what you do for a living? Have you ever just attacked someone on the street for no reason? Have you ever
1252.36,1257.08, killed a borough with your bare hands? Think and sue the Roth Lash. Be afraid to just answer the first question.
1257.6399999999999,1258.84, I guess yes to all the above.
1260.9199999999998,1263.0," Yeah, pretty much. Gentlemen. Yeah."
1264.52,1269.08," Yeah, do I tell? Usually if I know that through gamers, I'll say what I do. But if not,"
1269.08,1273.3999999999999, I'll say I'm a magazine editor and this leave it to that. The problem with that is right.
1273.3999999999999,1275.56," But sometimes I'll say that yeah, I work in a magazine."
1275.56,1279.8799999999999," I ask what magazine. And then I have to say, well, it's a video game magazine. And then it goes from like,"
1279.8799999999999,1285.8799999999999," oh, really to, oh, right, you know, the one that I get a lot is like, oh, so you test games?"
1285.96,1290.44, That's the way you cut that out. It's like girlfriend's parents still being a game. Even the
1290.44,1296.44," long gamers, you know, like if you, if it's happening before, when, uh, this is just comes off,"
1296.44,1300.44," you know, and I know that people are, we're even talking about the first place because they're talking"
1300.44,1304.44, about that they're playing some recent game that came out or something. And they only understand
1304.44,1309.3200000000002," it is, oh, you test games. And then the next level from that is he review games. And that's like,"
1309.3200000000002,1313.48," all, but as though that were all like you do. You ever get right there? You make games too."
1313.48,1321.0," I, because I just got that yesterday, in fact, I was at a, at a barbeque for my kids school,"
1321.0,1325.24, so all the parents were there. And these are the same people at every single damn time I've seen them.
1325.24,1329.88," So what do you do again? You know, so somebody said yesterday, so how's it going?"
1329.88,1335.72," Make in those games? Like, okay. Again, that's not a bad thing. You read a barbeque?"
1335.72,1340.04," Yeah, normally in those circumstances, you think they would like, nudge their kids and say, hey,"
1340.28,1345.72," this is just a call. He works with some of them, too. And I'm, you know, some of the, you know,"
1345.72,1349.96," the seventh grade boys and I think I have the cool scob in the world. Yeah, you know, right."
1349.96,1354.28," And then I'm going like, wow, this is our audience. Our, our, my, and learned it. That, to me,"
1354.28,1359.1599999999999," with a, like, a four or five year old. And they're like, he works with the deal games."
1360.76,1366.36," Yeah, I mean, it is like, you don't get it. He's the best cool people. He does birthdays."
1366.36,1368.36, It's one of the dumb weekends.
1368.36,1370.36, I'm not pretty much.
1370.9199999999998,1376.76," You don't take those graphics at you. Yeah, as had mixed reactions, the worst one I actually got was"
1376.76,1384.84," with the same group. My kids at a school in Berkeley, a private school and, you know, we are"
1384.84,1389.1599999999999," way on camping trip with all these parents. So we're all hanging out. And so you got your,"
1390.28,1394.36," you got your Berkeley intellectual parents there, pseudo intellectual parents all talk and"
1394.4399999999998,1401.9599999999998," we're all talking around to grill the dads. And one of the dads is a, uh, is a pediatrician who,"
1401.9599999999998,1407.8," um, specializes in obese kids. And at this point, this is early on and when I, when we joined the"
1407.8,1411.1599999999999," school and they didn't know what they did for a living yet. And so when we're all the sit around talking,"
1411.1599999999999,1415.8," I said, what I do. You're the candy man. Yeah. And the, the guy like went off on a thing's like,"
1415.8,1420.36," oh, so, you know, you're who I have to blame who I have to thank for all of my clients,"
1420.52,1427.4799999999998," all the obese kids that come in. Like, uh, yeah, no, I don't think so. I think we may be blame the"
1427.4799999999998,1431.8799999999999, parents. Okay. We don't blame the games again. So I have to have this conversation.
1431.8799999999999,1438.52," We have, that was video games because because kids are inside playing games and getting fat instead"
1438.52,1443.1599999999999, of outside X or something. It's probably problems by hooking up that doctor with the guide or message board
1443.1599999999999,1449.24, that was arguing that like all weight and body morphologies and entirely as in a 100% geneticly determined.
1449.32,1453.8," Oh, my gosh. Those two argue together and they were just like slip out, you know. Uh-huh."
1453.8,1460.1200000000001," So I don't know about you guys, but I, I encountered some some negativity along those lines or"
1461.32,1466.36," my wife used to actually, she's a high school teacher and she's actually be more in academia."
1466.36,1471.88," She was going for a PhD and when we hung out with those people in particular, it was always a"
1471.88,1476.76," bad scene when it came up. But I did then it was kind of like, oh, this is on his poor retarded"
1476.84,1478.52, husband.
1482.52,1486.92," You know, I got a very blue color family. So it's never. It's kind of cold and most of them."
1486.92,1491.48," Most of the time, if you have like one story here's what I recommend. If you have like one story"
1491.48,1496.12," and one trip you did that you could latch onto. Like I went to Britain to quote,"
1496.12,1499.56," talk to Angelina Jolie about the Tomb Raider movie. Yes, star."
1499.56,1503.16, I bring that one famous. Bring that one up and then suddenly like that's all people will talk about.
1503.16,1507.72," I mean, it is like, I think I've met her for four seconds. Uh-huh. But like, that's all you"
1507.72,1512.92," need because it's all totally totally get derailed into it. Well, the ones that got by got my family"
1512.92,1518.3600000000001, over it were things like I appeared on NPR once they interviewed me about like gaming violence or
1518.3600000000001,1523.24," whatever. And then my dad called up and he was like, ecstatic. I heard you on NPR Jeff, it's like,"
1523.24,1528.92," well, you, you have like a real career. I've already been here for like seven years. Like they had"
1529.4,1536.68," run an amazing here. Isn't that good enough for you, pop? Oh, you love me? It's interesting."
1536.68,1541.48," You like, I'm with you Sean, like parents are so like Luke O'Learn that the notion doesn't even"
1541.48,1545.24," matter what I write about. Like if I was like writing manuals or a tech writer or something,"
1545.24,1551.24, the fact that like someone in the family is like making money that doesn't involve like bust and
1551.24,1556.3600000000001," ask to do something running a printing press or something. Yeah. Yeah, but dad like is Autobotty, you know,"
1557.24,1560.6799999999998, he should have been retired a long time ago. He's still doing that stuff. But so it's like
1560.6799999999998,1564.9199999999998," easy for me. And instead like Jeff, you're in the position where you've got to like if games come up,"
1564.9199999999998,1570.1999999999998," you've immediately got to like, he's been to talk about like maybe civilization and various"
1570.1999999999998,1576.36, applications that that can lead to nonlinear thinking and stuff like that. It has never come up
1576.36,1582.76," at a family. Yeah, no, they think I'm slumming with like Kiddish. The basic attitude I'm dealing with."
1582.76,1587.72," Most of the time. But it's some point that we've encountered, you know,"
1589.32,1593.08," we've had that like basically use it now either way. Well, we didn't have to really use it out."
1593.08,1596.44, The only thing with like I'm assuming your parents too Sean is just like keep on the track that
1596.44,1601.48," it's like, yeah, it's about you're not making games and you're testing games, but you're writing it."
1601.48,1605.48, They get out. They know what I'm doing is for sure. And then it's cool. So you do just kind of
1605.48,1609.64, help on someone asks and you say a magazine editor that they don't follow it up and in their head they're
1609.64,1614.2," thinking like the Atlantic. Exactly. Yeah. That's a little tooographic. All right, you know, when I was"
1614.2,1620.68," in Ireland, we went to a wedding. This is going to make me sound so holy to it. It was like it just"
1621.4,1628.0400000000002," the groom was his father, the Belgian ambassador. So it was at the embassy there. It was really nice"
1628.0400000000002,1633.0800000000002," and there's big international group of people of course. You know, my life is content. And I met"
1634.1200000000001,1637.88," another guy who's like, oh, managing any room magazine, I'm like, oh, cool, you know, what are you"
1637.88,1642.1200000000001," at? And he was like rolling stone. And I'm like, oh, this is cool. Well, but interesting conversations."
1642.1200000000001,1647.3200000000002, It was like rolling stone Italy. And so we're talking in immediately like there was a hierarchy there
1647.3200000000002,1651.5600000000002," observed when I had to be like, yeah, like an enthusiast magazine for gaming, you know, so which immediately"
1651.5600000000002,1657.8000000000002," put me. And I was like, this is going to be awkward where I'm going to have to find ways to convince"
1657.8000000000002,1661.96," him that like that we have similar things. And they might be there like, and they were plenty,"
1662.04,1668.8400000000001," you know, like when just dealing with people are upset about interview or something or they're"
1668.8400000000001,1674.2, leaving your review wasn't positive enough. So we're not going to let you interview the star.
1674.2,1679.72," And but because of their based on the entire almost entirely non-indemic advertising,"
1679.72,1685.0, it was not like all advertisements for just timber like a shit. So if if just a timber like this
1685.0,1688.2," agents are like, you can't end up making this up. But this wasn't the artist who we've mentioned"
1688.28,1693.56," anything. They could be like, well, thank you. You know, we'll just go up to Rolling Stone UK."
1693.56,1697.0, We're going to tell France how to translate the same interview you already gave to them.
1697.56,1700.8400000000001," Or otherwise, where you're going to do, you're just going to shut yourself out from coverage and like"
1700.8400000000001,1705.48," 16 different international markets, you know. But anyway, long story short, what was funny is by the time"
1705.48,1711.72," halfway through the conversation, I asked what their scribe base was. And I was like, score when ours"
1711.72,1715.8," like outnumbered Rolling Stone Italy, by like four or five times. I was like, oh, cool."
1716.52,1721.0," Yeah, so that immediately like lifted like I know exactly, but it immediately. Well, the difference"
1721.0,1726.04," between the cash with the name, Rolling Stone and GW like it immediately like just a rod of"
1726.04,1730.68," almost like put put me back in the we need to consider magazine hierarchy. Yeah, we we need to"
1730.68,1735.08," start to think of with Nancy magazine editors of smaller nations. Yeah, we're bigger than you,"
1735.08,1736.12, fucker in Monaco.
1738.28,1745.1599999999999," Luxembourg Rolling Stone. I could tell one similar story, which is just it. I had the friend from high school"
1745.8799999999999,1753.48," who I, Maxi, don't talk to many more, but he, he, I know he works at variety magazine, which is an"
1753.48,1759.1599999999999," industry, Hollywood industry mag. And he runs into my mom down in LA, everyone's in"
1759.1599999999999,1764.76," Wacca's live in the same neighborhood. And he, you know, my name hasn't come up in whatever"
1764.76,1770.2," decades with this guy, whatever. And he asked, you know, when he ran into my mom, what what I did for"
1770.28,1778.1200000000001," living and he pulled him and she told me his reply was like, um, kind of this like, oh, the enthusiast"
1778.1200000000001,1783.24," press, well, that's a pretty good place to be these days in publishing, which is sort of like a kind of"
1783.24,1787.96," kind of kind of descending that damning with fake praise. Oh, that's cute. Yeah. Yeah."
1791.24,1796.92," Oh, we want us a little respect, man. Yeah, not really, whatever. I'm just kidding. I just, I get paid"
1796.92,1802.3600000000001," to talk about, you know, how shitty the seasonal is and drugs don't we got, we have, we have"
1802.3600000000001,1807.0800000000002," another, that's all you need. We have great jobs here. If you don't understand it, then no, yeah,"
1807.0800000000002,1811.8000000000002, talk to you. Don't get no respect. Don't last quick quick chance we can answer with just a few
1811.8000000000002,1817.4," names, but wavewalker wants to know what books were reading. Oh, there is never enough is because"
1817.4,1823.5600000000002," before when in the course of this, an interview with various writers in the industry that"
1823.8799999999999,1828.2," handled the writing for games, a lot of more mentioning, but they were into chronic"
1828.2,1833.1599999999999, with the artists of a road which we've just been out. And so we talked about that and they're
1833.1599999999999,1837.3999999999999," at it and a lot of people are like, hey, that's great. And they PM who back saying, hey, thanks for"
1837.3999999999999,1842.6799999999998," that recommendation. So what you guys reading, I am currently reading a left hand of darkness,"

1849.0,1855.24," there for you drop down the geek higher, classic, not based on the television show. No,"
1856.04,1859.88," I've got three books going at one, which is kind of how I do things. I think that's how I do."
1859.88,1866.6000000000001, And nonfiction and fiction going at the same time. So I'm finishing up a pretty great biography of
1866.6000000000001,1874.52, Lewis Armstrong. I read a lot of music books. And so this is a pretty great biography that
1874.52,1879.4," goes into a lot of the history of New Orleans and really jazz, which is a interesting line."
1879.4,1885.32, So that's my nonfiction and fiction. I am doing what a lot of people are doing these days.
1885.32,1890.84, And I'm going back through my vana get library now that the vana gets passed away. So I'm
1890.84,1897.4," reading cats cradle. And then third, I'm reading a really marvelous book by Marvelous. It's just"
1898.2800000000002,1905.0800000000002," right, why did I use that word? I know this guy every time he was talking about something,"
1905.0800000000002,1909.64, he always used the word phenomenal. So we would always say that the bat him behind his back.
1909.64,1917.16," That's in, which there was just phenomenal. So anyway, this, Simon Rushkey book called a"
1917.16,1922.3600000000001," Haroon in the Sea of Stories, so Jackson, my daughter had read for her a class and she passed on to me."
1922.36,1925.4799999999998," And it's a really brilliant song and I'm actually, but that's what I'm up to."
1927.1599999999999,1933.9599999999998," I mean, DC Comics countdown. That's all right. I'll just add to, I had to come up with something stupid."
1935.1599999999999,1939.3999999999999, Which one? You already read that. I don't know. That's the new line.

1963.3999999999999,1967.3999999999999," And this, sorry. I didn't mean to say that like condescending. I got shot. That's what the"
1967.3999999999999,1971.24," world that matters to it. But it's one that I've always wondered like to go back to, like to see what"
1971.24,1974.36," come up with. Yeah, that would be very similar. That's what it holds on. It seemed really, the"
1974.36,1981.4799999999998," vonic of death of that whole life. I'm liking it. And then this is a little more geeky,"
1981.4799999999998,1988.04," but I just finished reading the first four volumes of the, the penny arcade collected"
1989.3999999999999,1995.56, additions. Okay. Yeah. That's cool. It's kind of fun going back and reading. They have like these
1996.36,2001.08," these commentaries. They're, they're all annotated each step from like, you know, today's"
2001.1599999999999,2006.12, when did it start penny arcade now? It's Maddo. I need a button.

2014.1999999999998,2019.6399999999999," so off, but because it's transformed just so much. Yeah. He's gotten so excited. Yeah, it's totally. I mean,"
2019.6399999999999,2024.04," even, I mean, that happens with, with almost every shirt. We remember that one, obviously. Or that's"
2024.04,2028.6," one. That was a show like the early substance of the idea. Like the word or before that, the Trace"
2028.6,2034.12, of Chapant Show. Right. Trace the almond. Trace the almond. I've got a shitty cartoon.
2039.48,2050.52," A shitty cartoon. This is shitty. So, uh, they're covered on that. And that's like, yes."
2051.56,2056.2," But yeah, the old penny arcade comics do look really bad. And that's no like insult to them. The"
2056.2,2059.48," same way that like Matt, you know, what is a graining? I never knew how you got mad. Graining."
2059.48,2065.0," Graining. I don't think it's as jarring as this is a compliment. It's gotten, he's gotten really,"
2065.0,2071.08," really good. And the writing, I've gotten, I think improved. You know, it really fit in this"
2071.08,2074.4399999999996," groove now. I mean, he's definitely, he's got like, he's got a, he's got a fingerprint, you know,"
2074.4399999999996,2079.72," he's got a signature style. And he looks great. And what about you, Sean? You brought this up."
2080.6,2085.3199999999997," Oh, I'm reading, I do the same as you were. I got a bunch of books going at a given time and"
2085.4,2091.48," mix, uh, like, I'll have like, uh, sort of an indulgence book and then like a good piece of winter"
2091.48,2097.32," turning a good piece of, uh, nonfiction. So the nonfiction right now is Robert Fiss massive. I showed it to you."
2097.32,2102.52," I was like, yeah, I had a bar in the great war for civilization. And it's basically his, he was originally"
2102.52,2108.44," a times, you know, from a London reporter and then later in his career because of some editorial"
2108.44,2114.76," differences, um, started writing for the independent there. But it basically his history of"
2115.4,2121.2400000000002," just experience of reporting in the Middle East, everything from Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,"
2121.2400000000002,2126.84," everything that's happened in Lebanon is real, um, Palestine or Iraq or and ever, I mean, just,"
2126.84,2134.36," it's just really, really, uh, monumental work. And it's really cool. I like it. Um, just finished,"
2135.96,2141.0," Martin Amis is House of Beading, which is another, is that his most recent one? It just came out."
2141.0,2145.56," Yeah, so I get the heart of the sunken about the hardcover, which I usually, I tried to not"
2145.56,2149.64," have to do especially with fiction. So I read it two days and I'm like, yeah, I just paid 30 bucks. Yeah,"
2149.64,2154.6," yeah, I'm tired. Um, and it looks so nice and true. It's tough and it does. Yeah. And that's, I mean,"
2154.6,2158.36," if you know anything about him, like, that's really cool. I don't know if I wouldn't recommend, like,"
2158.36,2162.12," I mean, if you're, if you're, can send yourself a really casual reader, the kind that like,"
2162.12,2165.24," maybe you pick up the road and you're like, oh, this is cool. Like, you know, you have anything else,"

2185.1600000000003,2191.4," quality current fiction. Right. Um, even the border trilogy is not as hard to quote and quote as people"
2191.4,2196.6800000000003," make it out to be. No, it's dead. I mean, it's, it's, it's some of the language gets really broke and"
2196.68,2202.3599999999997," after it's like, there's a lot of sophisticated, not multi business, but, you know, I mean,"
2202.3599999999997,2207.3199999999997, there's a lot of stuff going on. Try to make your way through an issue of GFW. You can handle it.

2320.9199999999996,2324.2," we'll get through this together. Yeah. You know, someone else made the point of like,"
2324.2,2329.72," why that just doesn't sound like a lot of fun. Oh, no, like reading shouldn't be that. And if it is,"

2369.64,2373.56," often what I pick up when I'm about to fall asleep is like entertainment lately, because that's"
2373.56,2377.72," all my brain can handle at that point of the night. Right. So even though I'm reading these other things,"
2377.72,2381.24," there's just different, yeah, there's different time, I mean, sometimes you're in a mood like anything,"
2381.24,2384.92," you know, sometimes you're in a mood to play along. Yes, you know, oblivion, sometimes you want to play"
2385.0,2389.48," Pac-Man, whatever the new days came out, sometimes you want to read our sheet comics."
2391.48,2397.8," Sometimes you want to read bazooka joke comics. When you can't read the word, right, and I"
2397.8,2403.4," are going to have a war between like fanboy, bazooka, Joe fanboys and some other comics that comes"

2417.5600000000004,2421.88," I had a lot of project I meant to say when I'm finished with these three, it's going to be hot fan."
2421.88,2428.1200000000003, It's the last time I read that was in school as a as an assignment. So I want to read that now as an adult
2428.1200000000003,2435.5600000000004," per fund when it's not forced upon exactly. That changes things. I got in the news, like,"
2435.5600000000004,2440.2000000000003," I got some like the real like good comic book stuff to you, which I don't even consider in my reading"
2440.2,2443.7999999999997, material because it's like I usually read them before I even don't read them before I didn't get
2443.7999999999997,2449.3999999999996," that home on the bar or something. You don't count those, but that's like what Ryan's left."
2449.96,2454.9199999999996, But Ryan saved his art though on each page he looks and tries to see is that like a bush he must
2454.9199999999996,2464.2799999999997," buy it or something. Many next page. No. Hey, you guys. Come on, I'm slash back."
