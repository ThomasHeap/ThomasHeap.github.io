77.12,78.64, the point of it was it was an interpretive
78.64,80.6, dance of against something like the

116.84,118.52000000000001, well for the first point I wanted to
118.52,121.11999999999999, make today which was that last week
121.11999999999999,122.88, when we did that little item about the
122.88,125.88, guys who dug up the body and then made
125.88,128.92, a bond out of a skull. So I got a few
128.92,130.4," emails that were like dude, I didn't know"
130.4,133.32, like you smoked pot. And I just want to
133.32,134.64, say you know because there's a lot of
134.64,136.56, kids listening to the show and you
136.56,138.35999999999999, know where we're role models to some
138.35999999999999,140.44, extent that that that was a grave
140.44,143.16," misunderstanding. Oh, God, that's horrible."
143.16,146.0, I didn't mean grave. I swear I didn't
146.0,148.32," mean that. But you know,"
149.48000000000002,151.0, I want you guys all to know that you
151.0,153.48000000000002," know, I don't need that kind of"
153.48000000000002,155.56," things, you know, to to get high."
155.56,163.04000000000002," I mean, I, I guess. I can use my hand"
163.04000000000002,165.60000000000002, crafted Hawaiian wooden bong with the
165.60000000000002,168.20000000000002," extra carburetor. I mean, no, that's"
168.20000000000002,169.48000000000002, not what I meant to say. I'm at the
169.48000000000002,171.76000000000002, sag at high on life in America.
171.76000000000002,173.72," You know, I have an American flag that I"
173.72,175.64000000000001, can just look at my house if I want to
175.64000000000001,177.12," get high. This is for my employers,"
177.12,179.12," so I'm like an eagle. My family,"
179.84,181.84, both right and all the readers at both
181.84,184.44, Ryan and I have never smoked pot or
184.44,186.84," both you. You and Ryan, none of us have."
186.84,188.56," All right, we don't drink smoke,"
188.56,192.24, cuss or chew. This is a family podcast.
192.24,193.76, Right. If you know anybody that ever
193.76,195.04000000000002," has done those things, you should"
195.04000000000002,198.24, shut them. That's not good for you.
198.24,199.52, I should say though for all my
199.52,201.20000000000002," med stories, I've never even tried"
201.20000000000002,203.88, Christomette. That's a fat. You're
203.88,205.24, alone in this room on that one.
206.20000000000002,207.48000000000002, We have done.
209.0,209.8," Look, is that's like,"
209.8,212.04000000000002, all what is it? Experiences you've had around
212.04000000000002,214.76000000000002, it. It's just beyond peer pressure on that.
214.76000000000002,216.04000000000002, When I see what happened to the
216.04000000000002,217.56, fools and I like this and the whole
217.56,219.72, one. This is a good story here.
219.72,221.4, But it's one that I don't want to be a
221.4,222.28, store principal.
222.28,222.84, Right.
222.84,224.12, Do not use this.
224.12,225.64000000000001, There actually are great stories.
225.64000000000001,227.96, Only talk to like the yield timers in
227.96,230.44, the game industry of like people in
230.44,232.84, meetings at EA with like bongs on the
232.84,234.68, table as they were like planning stuff.
234.76000000000002,236.6," You know, wow. Yep."
236.6,238.36, I'm sure it still happens sometimes.
238.36,239.32, For the good old days.
239.32,241.32, I'm sure it happens. Sounds like.
241.32,242.76000000000002, I'm sure it doesn't want to those old
242.76000000000002,243.48000000000002, album covers.
243.48000000000002,244.76000000000002, Let's say they talked about that.
244.76000000000002,245.64000000000001, That's how they made them.
245.64000000000001,247.96, What? Anthony wants to tell us about
247.96,249.24, this weekend job.
249.24,252.76000000000002," I work at a, um, well, again,"
252.76000000000002,254.92000000000002," I don't smoke, but never have."
254.92000000000002,256.68, But I do work at a medical marijuana
256.68,257.48, dispensary.
257.48,257.96000000000004, Do you?
257.96000000000004,259.72," On the weekends, a lot of times, for"
259.72,262.44," extra money, that my sister owns."
262.44,263.64, I've had this cough.
263.71999999999997,268.59999999999997, But if you were thinking of the one
268.59999999999997,270.28," place where there would be, where there"
270.28,272.59999999999997, would be a bomb on the planning table.
272.59999999999997,273.47999999999996, While they're working.
273.47999999999996,273.88, Yeah.
273.88,275.96, It was like the amazing thing that like
275.96,276.68, you worked there.
276.68,277.32, You don't smoke.
277.32,278.68, You've never smoked in these people
278.68,280.44," come in and they're like, I don't know"
280.44,280.76, man.
280.76,282.36, Would you recommend like the indica?
282.36,283.96," Would you recommend the, well, the"
283.96,285.24, funny thing is they'll say the name.
285.24,287.24," So they're like, yo, dog, should I get"
287.24,288.68, some like misty mountain?
288.68,289.64, Is that how a stick?
289.64,290.59999999999997, Is that what you're doing?
290.59999999999997,290.76, Is that what you're doing?
290.76,291.0, Is that what you're doing?
291.0,291.4, Is that what you're doing?
291.4,291.8, Is that what you're doing?
291.8,293.0, Is that what you're doing?
293.16,295.48, You recommend what like type of like
295.48,297.32, marijuana brownie people should pick up?
297.32,298.84," I hope I'm a, do you or like,"
300.84,304.2," but so, so I'm envisioning this, this terminal"
304.2,306.04," patient or this like, you know, half blind"
306.04,308.68," going to person like, yo, dog, you know,"
308.68,309.8, I can't see this shit.
309.8,310.84, Tell me what the good stuff is.
310.84,312.76," Now, the, the, come on, I, I told you,"
312.76,314.12, there's like the terminally ill people
314.12,315.32," that come in and then of course,"
315.32,318.2, there's like the people that went to like
318.2,320.76," the doctor, everyone on like the pot form."
320.92,325.0," Says like this is the, this is the guy to go to for the,"
325.0,326.84," for the hook up, he'll write you prescription for"
326.84,327.96," headding, hop and buses."
329.08,331.4," So do you get people coming in that just look like,"
331.4,334.28," you know, stoners who just want the hook up and they"
334.28,335.88, they don't look remotely sick at all.
335.88,338.59999999999997," Just, yeah, like, is that what most of the day is like,"
338.59999999999997,343.0," in fact, yeah, you ever had, what about like,"
343.0,344.52, if you're at a kicks or one out?
344.52,347.4," I haven't had to kick someone out, but I've had to tell"
347.4,349.96, people they can't come in and that's when they freak out
350.91999999999996,353.0," or they try and like, well, first they do like the thing"
353.0,354.91999999999996, everyone does like anybody that's worked your
354.91999999999996,356.91999999999996," details had that person that comes up and they're like,"
356.91999999999996,358.59999999999997," hey man, I need to return this and you're like,"
358.59999999999997,360.59999999999997," gosh, star policy doesn't allow you to do that."
360.59999999999997,362.76, And that was sudden go from like being like friends with you
362.76,364.2," just being like, hey, you."
364.2,365.4," Yeah, exactly, that's what it's like."
365.4,367.4," Wait, let's return things to the medical marijuana."
367.4,368.2," Oh, they're not."
368.2,370.2," I'm begging, I'm begging seeds and twigs."
370.2,371.79999999999995, I do.
371.79999999999995,374.67999999999995," They're like, what I worked in grocery in produce like one time"
374.67999999999995,378.03999999999996, this guy comes in with like a big zip lock bag and it just had
378.12,378.76000000000005, mush in it.
378.76000000000005,382.12," It was just like a black and brown mush in a bag and he's like,"
382.12,382.84000000000003, I need a refund.
382.84000000000003,383.8," I was like, what is that?"
384.68,386.20000000000005," He's like, it was a swash."
386.20000000000005,388.04," I was like, well, did you buy it like that?"
388.04,391.32000000000005, Did you come in here with like a fucking scoop and scrape it off
391.32000000000005,393.24, with the refrigeration grace?
393.24,394.44, And then now you want to refund it?
394.44,395.32000000000005, I'm not it.
395.32000000000005,396.92," And he was like, man, because it's supposed to be, you know,"
396.92,397.72, he's always right.
397.72,398.68," He's like, where's your manager?"
399.56,400.92, It sounds like he used food.
400.92,402.12, It's been processed.
402.12,404.84000000000003, So the takeaway from this conversation is that
404.91999999999996,406.67999999999995, Zif Davis has pushed me to selling drugs.
408.2,409.0, I'm not.
411.79999999999995,413.08, How do you get a job like that?
413.08,413.88," That's it, Ross."
413.88,415.23999999999995," Again, my sister owns it."
415.23999999999995,416.44," Oh, okay."
416.44,419.71999999999997," Now could she or you, this was a serious question like,"
419.71999999999997,421.32," like, be busted?"
421.32,423.88," I mean, it's just all like I'm not up on what the current law"
423.88,425.88, should be bested by federal agents.
425.88,426.52, Yeah.
426.52,427.15999999999997, Yeah.
427.15999999999997,428.67999999999995, And then I would just lose my job.
428.67999999999995,431.71999999999997," But only federal agents, no state police can do anything."
432.52,434.52, So yeah.
434.68,435.4, Suppled that law.
435.4,436.68, So did you just sell her up the river here?
437.88,438.03999999999996, Yeah.
438.03999999999996,438.28, Yeah.
438.28,440.12," No, all the federal agents listening to the"
440.12,440.68," Yeah, all right."
440.68,441.08, Yeah.
441.08,441.71999999999997," Oh, okay."
441.71999999999997,442.52, She has a bit.
442.52,443.32," Wait a minute, Joe."
443.32,444.52, She has a couple of state cases.
444.52,445.79999999999995, She has a California state cases.
445.79999999999995,446.52," Oh, no."
446.52,447.71999999999997, She's legit.
447.71999999999997,448.12, Run.
448.12,449.4, Guyay goes through the computer.
449.4,451.15999999999997, They pay taxes and all that business.
451.15999999999997,451.79999999999995, So yeah.
451.79999999999995,452.35999999999996, Yeah.
452.35999999999996,453.88, And government's getting their cut.
453.88,454.76, Yeah.
454.76,455.4, Yeah.
455.4,455.88, All right.
455.88,456.76, So on to something else.
456.76,458.28," And then put up, right."
458.28,459.24, Yeah.
459.24,459.56, Yeah.
459.56,460.2, Huh?
460.2,460.35999999999996, What's up?
460.35999999999996,461.0, Are you Ryan?
461.0,461.79999999999995, What's up with last?
461.79999999999995,462.84, I'm all right.
462.84,463.79999999999995," It's up with last, right."
464.52,466.12, Last spoiler's early in the show.
466.76,467.64, Just to make this up.
467.64,468.44, You watch this show.
468.44,468.84," Oh, yeah."
468.84,469.79999999999995, I watched last.
469.79999999999995,471.79999999999995, Ryan's our resident expert.
471.79999999999995,472.28, I know.
472.28,473.32, Do you have any questions for Ryan?
473.96,474.76, Ask Ryan.
475.96,476.76, Who's in the coffin?
477.47999999999996,479.4," Oh, I have a theory about that."
479.4,480.2, That's okay.
480.2,481.4, It's different than the last theory.
481.4,483.4, I didn't know I had a theory about this before.
483.4,483.79999999999995, Yeah.
483.79999999999995,484.35999999999996, That was good.
484.35999999999996,486.35999999999996, So they're been a few things.
486.35999999999996,487.32, A few cranky methods.
487.32,488.28, That's a lost line line.
488.28,489.88, That's about our last spoilers.
489.88,491.08, So I've decided.
491.08,491.88, But this is a theory.
491.88,492.44, It's not right.
492.44,494.35999999999996," So just ahead of time, no, that this is only"
494.36,495.0, theory.
495.0,496.92, It's coming right at a Ryan's brain with
496.92,497.8, it's not reliable.
498.44,501.08000000000004," So if he says this stuff now, don't be mad."
501.08000000000004,502.12, Because it's not so.
502.12,503.40000000000003, It's actually going to happen on the show.
503.40000000000003,505.40000000000003, Because theories are always not in the
505.40000000000003,505.72, podcast.
505.72,506.44," No, no, no, no."
506.44,506.92, Okay.
506.92,507.48," No, wait."
507.48,507.96000000000004, You hear this.
507.96000000000004,508.52000000000004, Okay.
508.52000000000004,508.68, Okay.
508.68,511.96000000000004," So you know, Jack attended a mystery"
511.96000000000004,513.48, person's funeral at any splash
513.48,514.6800000000001," forward, I think, in the season three."
514.6800000000001,515.48," Yes, right."
515.48,516.12," No, no, no."
516.12,517.32, It's in the coffin.
517.32,517.48, Right.
517.48,520.12," So, you know, I read my share."
520.12,521.72, Is this a time-life book series?
521.72,524.28, I read my share.
524.28,526.28, I'm going to say I'm going to say that
526.28,528.28, Jack is in the coffin.
528.28,530.28, There you go.
530.28,532.28, Jack was in the coffin.
532.28,534.28, Whoa.
534.28,536.28, I'm going to the internet with one.
536.28,538.28, Wow.
538.28,540.28, Wow.
540.28,542.28, This is the problem with this show.
542.28,544.28, Like after that's the possible.
544.28,546.28," Actually, I know."
546.28,548.28," I'm not, I'm not the speedy."
548.28,550.28," You, that could be."
550.28,552.28," Well, like in addition to running with the whole"
552.28,553.28," like, introduce three more questions."
553.28,555.28," Every time you answer a single question thing,"
555.28,557.28, it's now gotten so beyond the point of anyone.
557.28,559.28, It reminds me of a Jeff Lowe comic.
559.28,563.28," He wrote like Batman, The Long Halloween,"
563.28,564.28, and Batman.
564.28,565.28, So he arrived on the show.
565.28,566.28, Yes.
566.28,567.28, I think he is.
567.28,569.28," It's probably definitely not a good sign at all,"
569.28,571.28, because this guy writes these books where
571.28,573.28, their mystery stories.
573.28,575.28," And the whole thing is, is that, you know,"
575.28,577.28," you start off, you're like, okay, I'm going to pay attention"
577.28,579.28, every detail and see if I can salute my way through this.
579.28,581.28," But of course, you never can because no one could have."
581.28,583.28," They'd like introduce, it's like, oh,"
583.28,585.28," none of the evidence had to do with any, you know,"
585.28,589.28," the, the, the real culprit had, you know, nothing to do with any of the story,"
589.28,591.28, up until this final issue of the thing.
591.28,593.28," And I mean, it's reminded of all red herrings."
593.28,597.28," Yeah, so I've gotten to the point where I've just given up on theories."
597.28,598.28, I don't think any more lost.
598.28,599.28, I kind of have to.
599.28,600.28," I mean, long time ago."
600.28,602.28," Actually, I don't think it makes sense."
602.28,604.28," It would be Jack, because Jack was like,"
604.28,606.28," like, there was a newspaper article that was what he,"
606.28,607.28, how we found out about it.
607.28,609.28," It all turned it timeline, Jack."
609.28,610.28," Yeah, but."
610.28,612.28," Well, they could just do it and then everyone will be like,"
612.28,615.28," whoa, and then the writers figure out what to do next season."
615.28,617.28, So they have like all the shops to figure it out.
617.28,619.28, You think that's what we're going to see at the end of this season.
619.28,621.28, Jack's making down.
621.28,622.28, It has on body and his coffin.
622.28,623.28, I just make it.
623.28,625.28, That would have been a weird reaction for Kate.
625.28,627.28," I'm like, why would you go to your own funeral?"
627.28,629.28," I mean, she was so like, boss."
629.28,630.28, I think it makes sense.
630.28,633.28," It's Michael because Michael's the one who, like,"
633.28,634.28," can't die, right?"
634.28,635.28, They tried to kill himself.
635.28,636.28, They tried to kill him.
636.28,639.28," But it's like now he's like in this last episode,"
639.28,642.28, he's going to fulfill whatever that his bargain.
642.28,644.28, He's going to like save the oceanic sex.
644.28,645.28, That's the way I don't feel like it.
645.28,646.28, I'm just going to let him die now.
646.28,647.28, There isn't a don't think it's Michael.
647.28,648.28, It was because of what Sean said.
648.28,651.28, Like the clues are too obvious for it to be Michael.
651.28,653.28, Like they've laid the trail that it's Michael.
653.28,655.28, So that means they have something completely that has nothing to do with that.
655.28,658.28, I think that Ryan is probably Anthony's biggest customer.
658.28,663.28," Honestly, this show."
663.28,666.28," I thought the show was just about people like surviving in a island,"
666.28,668.28," and being crabs and shit, I've never seen it."
668.28,669.28, I know.
669.28,671.28, I did like the start playing at Twilight Zone.
671.28,672.28, Exactly.
672.28,673.28, You guys are saying alternate timelines.
673.28,674.28, What's up with that?
674.28,676.28," It's a time-life book that was like, it's probably"
676.28,678.28, little too old for you.
678.28,681.28," But, uh, well, it's like early 80s, right?"
681.28,683.28," Tell us, Graham, Bob, about time-life."
683.28,684.28, I was before that.
684.28,686.28, It's a Christmas Christmas in Jeff and Sean.
686.28,687.28, You knew about it.
687.28,688.28, I know.
688.28,689.28, It was like books about the occult shit.
689.28,691.28, They had these ass-dresses that I explained.
691.28,692.28, Yeah.
692.28,693.28, Three men into a shrouded ring of trees.
693.28,695.28, One is mystically levitated.
695.28,698.28, Three feet above the bog surface.
698.28,700.28, That coincidence or like supernatural.
700.28,701.28, It's in the book.
701.28,702.28," And then they'd have another one like,"
702.28,705.28," Barney Poeke,"
705.28,708.28," said on a tack in like whatever in Arkansas,"
708.28,713.28, 300 miles away his identical twin brother felt a stabbing pain in his rectum.
713.28,717.28," That's like, it's in the living room."
717.28,718.28," It's like, it's in the living room."
718.28,720.28," You look at that up like, lost shit."
720.28,721.28," You look at up in the book though,"
721.28,722.28," and it's like, coincidence?"
722.28,723.28, Yes.
723.28,724.28, And that's it.
724.28,725.28, So full?
725.28,726.28, Yeah.
726.28,727.28, Yeah.
727.28,728.28, So little ones.
728.28,729.28, Now go buy our loud west books.
729.28,731.28, There's like a definition of Arkham's Razor.
731.28,733.28," And then like, I'll screw the book."
733.28,735.28," It's like, work it out yourself."
735.28,737.28, I'm going to start.
737.28,738.28, We just made the commercial.
738.28,740.28, We didn't know people would buy the books.
740.28,742.28, I'm just going to start raining frogs.
742.28,744.28, So to throw in some game stuff.
744.28,745.28, Yeah.
745.28,747.28, We get too far alone.
747.28,749.28, Age of Conan came out yesterday.
749.28,751.28, I was just launching yesterday.
752.28,753.28, In the US.
753.28,754.28, Yeah.
754.28,756.28, Some people were playing it before that because they paid.
756.28,758.28," Oh, those like a pre-my dollar."
758.28,759.28, Yeah.
759.28,760.28, You get a head start.
760.28,762.28," They made good use of that because, you know, I'm going to."
762.28,767.28, People are in there already quite a few relatively high level players in there to
767.28,770.28, to gain us and for us to team up on and feel like we're pulling a David and
770.28,772.28, glass maneuver.
772.28,775.28," Um, what do you how are you feeling about the game so far?"
775.28,777.28, I just say non-mm first.
777.28,780.28," It seems like it's I don't, I don't know, but there are a number of servers."
780.28,781.28, I'm just going to say that they're all more populated.
781.28,782.28, Many of them are heavily populated.
782.28,787.28," I had to wait in order to create an account on tyranny, which is a PVP server."
787.28,788.28, Free for L PVP.
788.28,789.28, Yeah.
789.28,790.28, Free for L PVP.
790.28,793.28," And, um, when you get in there's just a ton of stuff going on."
793.28,799.28, And I only played until like I got like level seven or so and what pissed me off immediately.
799.28,801.28, Here I go already into the bad stuff.
801.28,805.28," Is that we figured out that, you know, we're going around and we're trying to do, you know,"
805.28,807.28, the quest multiplayer quest.
807.28,808.28, And it just wasn't working.
808.28,811.28, Like all the enemies were like level 10 to 15.
811.28,817.28," And even as a group, we just couldn't kill them effectively without dying ourselves over and over again."
817.28,824.28, And so Rory and Duncan and other people in our control server who had played the both the beta and had the early access.
824.28,826.28," We're like, you got to just do the night missions."
826.28,831.28," And in this game, they separate single from multiplayer as Davey and multiplayer and night being instance solo missions."
831.28,832.28, Right.
832.28,836.28, And that was the last thing I was willing to do is like the game is like marginally interesting.
836.28,840.28, As a multiplayer game and it's entirely for me based on the social experience.
840.28,842.28, And for me to go and play that on my own time.
842.28,843.28," Like no, no thanks."
843.28,844.28, So I turned it off.
844.28,847.28," I mean, I had a review game to put to play as well."
847.28,850.28," Um, what can you can level up in the multiplayer, right?"
850.28,852.28, That's what you're saying is apparently can't.
852.28,853.28, What can you are?
853.28,854.28," Well, can you are obviously close?"
854.28,861.28," Well, root force it, but it's very difficult to the point that like we're doing like these beginning missions that that you're acquiring is a level, you know,"
861.28,863.28, a level five or six it is.
863.28,865.28," You get out of the training mode, you know,"
865.28,869.28, you can pick up some quests and those ones were just like prohibitively difficult.
869.28,878.28," And then we didn't necessarily help ourselves because in this PvP free for all server, you go to white sand as one of these first, you know, areas and everyone there."
878.28,885.28, That's like free for all when you need free for all the even that there's no like faction of your own race can attack your own crab.
885.28,886.28, Okay.
886.28,891.28," So what that means is as soon as you appear anytime you see someone you may contact, they fight you."
891.28,892.28, They start.
893.28,894.28, They're attacking me.
894.28,895.28, It's barbarian.
895.28,907.28," And this will, I hear that this is fairly normal for any free for all PvP game in the early months following release and what happens is things settle down and then you have coalitions and aligns is not going to be interesting."
907.28,919.28," But right now it's like fucking like betas, you know fighting fish or something and you throw us all on the tank and it's just like you look at the stats see if it's a fight you want and but there's always going to be someone that's in there stronger than you attack new."
919.28,928.28, But it was kind of funny even in that stage because we got like I'm going to assassine so I can cloak and do these you know backstab attacks for critical damage and.
928.28,939.28, Rory give me this buff that like made it even you know more powerful so we'd wait and watch these guys we go invisible as soon as you spawn in this thing you cloak because that's how quick you're going to die if you don't.
939.28,942.28, So are there like known spawn points.
942.28,947.28, Oh yeah totally I people waiting at those yeah and the thing is is that we were we're trying to level.
947.28,957.28, Not because I care about the quest I think they're the same as ever they're boring and they're just I mean and a lot of people differ this is you know this is what I wanted to bring down preparation Julian Murdox been playing a lot and.
957.28,968.28, He wrote a story on gamers with jobs and it's about how much he loves the combat and stuff and it's like I was getting I wanted to present that as an informed counterpoint to my own perspective because I think he makes a perfect case for himself.
968.28,982.28, But so when we go back and finish that story so you know we cloak and then we'd go and hide in the bushes we'd wait for a high level player to get in the combat you know scenario with a mob and then it's like okay then I sneak up and stab in the back because he's fighting like a whole bunch of like crocodiles and then everyone else.
982.28,984.28, It's like blowing the contra something in.
984.28,995.28, Lord of the rings then I mean Lord of the Flies and then everyone comes right in at the bushes and we all like beat on him and even though we're all weak enough there's enough of us where we can like overtake him you know and then we kill him and.
995.28,999.28," He was just spot again and come right back for us, but it's like we felt good about it and we close right in and."
999.28,1011.28, But the idea is that we wanted to level up so we can go to these points like islands where people have to get to where this pinch points are bridges over lava and then we've become total keepers and we demand like we want to collect blowing cloth so it's like.
1011.28,1013.28, Passes bridge if you give you your loincloth.
1013.28,1017.28, That's all that's all beginning players have in the game.
1017.28,1023.28, But unfortunately you can't drop loot and you can you can get rid of items.
1023.28,1035.28, But you can't have them appear in the world because otherwise we could just build a giant like stag loincloth at the site of the bridge and people would know right it probably is just right as soon as they drop it right and that's to prevent people from doing you know like the whole rating.
1035.28,1037.28, And then you play the game and it's like I got killed.
1037.28,1039.28, I was fighting a crocodile.
1039.28,1041.28, I want to put you people jump and stab me in the back or scared.
1041.28,1043.28, I had to give you guys my loincloth.
1043.28,1045.28, It's like there's no way lives up to the fiction.
1045.28,1047.28, Right.
1047.28,1049.28, Robertie Howard killed my a lot.
1049.28,1051.28, What's going on here?
1051.28,1053.28, What happened to my world.
1053.28,1055.28, Yeah.
1055.28,1057.28, I got a fairly I got a I have a shit character.
1057.28,1059.28, I got a lot of things.
1059.28,1061.28, I got a lot of things.
1061.28,1063.28, Yeah.
1063.28,1065.28, I got a fairly I got a I have a shit character.
1065.28,1069.28, And she's like I mean it looks like a messed up friego or something.
1069.28,1071.28, I like did everything I could make it messed up.
1071.28,1075.28, She's got a shiner really crazy cricket nose and a butcher cut.
1075.28,1079.28, But I have like a cap on that looks like a like she's wearing the tip the res war tip.
1079.28,1081.28, Condom for a hat.
1081.28,1085.28, And I don't know it's pretty sad but everyone already is like came in.
1085.28,1087.28, People are like running up and like laughing at me and stuff.
1087.28,1091.28, That's the thing that's part of the way you can tell instantly that I need you
1091.28,1093.28, weren't in it for the long haul.
1093.28,1097.28, The rest of us made characters that were like man my god looks badass or whatever.
1097.28,1103.28," Yeah, it looks like what your character's name Abiza probably or something like that."
1103.28,1105.28, Yeah.
1105.28,1107.28, I could make her that that more with Leo Beast.
1107.28,1109.28, She's pretty muscular.
1109.28,1113.28, Like it still turns me on like you can climb in this game and like I'll take a look you know like
1113.28,1115.28, the I'm moved camera beneath or what I'm climbing.
1115.28,1117.28, I'm not really sure if they're what I'm climbing.
1117.28,1119.28, That's clean.
1119.28,1121.28, I don't know.
1121.28,1123.28, Exactly.
1123.28,1127.28, It's that night time solo game that you that's for him and you from playing
1127.28,1131.28, World that's preventing me kind of from playing again because I
1131.28,1133.28, made a beta character and went through all of that already.
1133.28,1137.28, And the thought of doing it again and that's yeah here's what I'm wondering about this
1137.28,1141.28, game and I just don't know the answer is that if you do create alt now.
1141.28,1143.28, Yeah.
1143.28,1147.28, So you want to you've made it through that first level that first 20 levels of the single player stuff.
1147.28,1151.28, You have to do it again every time you create a new character.
1151.28,1152.28, Yeah.
1152.28,1153.28, Same zone.
1153.28,1157.28," Well, every time even another place as far as I know every new character you create you have to like"
1157.28,1161.28, you you have to go through the beginning game quest every time.
1161.28,1162.28, Right.
1162.28,1163.28, Just like you start on a boat in the boat.
1163.28,1165.28, And does this doesn't matter what character is it right?
1165.28,1167.28, Is it all the same?
1167.28,1170.28, I think it's like like heard it's slightly different for healers versus like majors.
1170.28,1173.28, There's a couple different tweaks to the quest line but I don't know how to do it.
1173.28,1184.28, But you're still everybody no matter what your alt is it's going to be in the same city with the same same same chain of night quest until you can get strong enough to go to the day quest that we're trying to get a whole lot.
1184.28,1185.28, Yeah.
1185.28,1187.28, Because at least a heavy to alt makes things clear.
1187.28,1188.28," Well, that's what I mean."
1188.28,1190.28," Yeah, you can't even get through the first time."
1190.28,1194.28, Still the I mean this game makes like the speed of leveling up and wow.
1194.28,1199.28, Look like super slow like seriously like with you by the time you reach the first city or
1199.28,1202.28, already like level six or something like that.
1202.28,1203.28, So it's like God.
1203.28,1205.28, But I don't think it's in the house that pace is so fast.
1205.28,1206.28, I don't know.
1206.28,1212.28, I mean Duncan and Rory were like staying up to the hit level 40 last night and they've only been playing for like three days.
1212.28,1213.28, They did.
1213.28,1214.28, Yeah.
1214.28,1215.28, They said they weren't going to bed to the hip.
1215.28,1216.28, So these fuckers man.
1216.28,1217.28, That's sad.
1217.28,1219.28," Because they yeah, they were already like level 28."
1219.28,1220.28, That's like that.
1220.28,1221.28, No sleep until 40.
1221.28,1224.28, If that's exactly like Duncan basically has to really have him.
1224.28,1226.28, Rory if they were going to commit to it.
1226.28,1227.28, He's like I'm ready or you.
1227.28,1228.28, All right.
1229.28,1232.28, Think of the emptiness the moment after maybe last night was my last bit.
1232.28,1233.28, Like oh yeah.
1233.28,1236.28," Well hey, you know, Rory's got to use he's reviewing it."
1236.28,1238.28, So yeah he has a really good.
1238.28,1239.28, It's that old problem though.
1239.28,1245.28," You know, like they'll all be ahead of me now and it's like a good because they will like if I go back now they'll be able to help me get through."
1245.28,1248.28," Um, you know, the stuff that was too hard for us last night."
1248.28,1255.28," The levels we were, but at the same time it's like I just get to be the one who hangs around in the back and I guess it frees me up to type."
1256.28,1257.28, I can talk to shift.
1257.28,1258.28," Yeah, let's redo."
1258.28,1259.28, Just be a pet.
1259.28,1260.28, I don't know.
1260.28,1262.28, Like they're definitely good things about it.
1262.28,1265.28, Like I think the the special ability.
1265.28,1271.28, Like powers that use net are definitely like not I mean they look like wow in that like you push seven.
1271.28,1273.28, Feel like do your character special ability.
1273.28,1276.28, But did you see it like how you have to like what do you have that's different than my character.
1276.28,1278.28," Sure didn't have anything different than well, but I know that."
1278.28,1283.28, Well the thing is is that not only do you have to push like the button to like to initiate the power right?
1283.28,1284.28, Just like wow.
1284.28,1285.28, Like a hard slash.
1285.28,1290.28," But then once you do it in order for it to actually occur, you have to do a specific combination."
1290.28,1291.28," Oh, the combo attacks right."
1291.28,1294.28," Yeah, I thought that might be my class didn't have any of the things."
1294.28,1295.28," Okay, well, you might did a site."
1295.28,1299.28, I thought that was like super cool that I didn't just have to push it.
1299.28,1302.28," But actually, it's a three one four."
1302.28,1303.28," No, you won four."
1303.28,1304.28, That's a good.
1304.28,1305.28, Backwards your 80.
1305.28,1308.28, And then what does game need is the we were mode.
1308.28,1311.28, The thing is is like sort of the creep at that.
1311.28,1316.28," And then the way we get different differs that of course, you know, you have the one two and three,"
1316.28,1320.28," and that's the attack on the left, the right or head on and don't have it so that it loosely correlates."
1320.28,1324.28, Like if you're fighting a panther head on will be basically it's teeth.
1324.28,1326.28, So it's like it's discouraging you from doing that.
1326.28,1328.28, You're going to want to tackle one of its flanks.
1328.28,1332.28, But the difference is you're just pressing one or three instead of two.
1332.28,1336.28," Sometimes they will change and it will sync up and it like, okay, this makes sense."
1336.28,1338.28, This guy's holding a shield on this right side.
1338.28,1342.28," You want to hit him over there or if he turns, then it will adjust as well."
1342.28,1343.28, That's cool.
1343.28,1347.28," But when I'm playing because I mean, we're not taught let's not be confused and think we're talking about, you know,"
1347.28,1349.28," an inch of guidance or you know, devil make cry or something."
1349.28,1355.28," Where the when you hit someone, the animation sync up and they very clearly getting hit specifically by the move."
1355.28,1362.28," You just perform and vice versa or like a fighting game, you know, it's like, it has to me the feel of when."
1362.28,1367.28," When kids play guns, you know, you what do you call it just called guns and it's like, you're dead."
1367.28,1368.28," No, you're dead."
1368.28,1371.28," And there's like, there's a total mismatch between the pantomime that are going on."
1371.28,1374.28," And so it's like, right, I get that and I can't immerse myself."
1374.28,1383.28," But for Julie and he was saying that as you go on for him, you know, being able to dodge because there's a vase of maneuvers and stuff and combining that with the group tactics."
1383.28,1392.28, So like if he'll go in doing attack and double tap back and jump jump out of the fray and then someone else will come in and then he'll hop back in and do something for him.
1392.28,1402.28," He's getting, I mean, I hope I'm not a misrepresenting is, you know, it's perspective, it seems like he thinks that as far as MMO comic goes, it's just really fantastic stuff."
1402.28,1409.28," I haven't got to the point where I'm seeing it is anything more than like what Sean said, like when you describe it, it's like, okay, so I pressed to more."
1409.28,1421.28," Well, the thing is, like, I could see it being like in PvP and wow, I definitely think that takes a lot of skill, but like this, I could see it's even making it like more gratifying when I manage to pull off my special abilities."
1421.28,1430.28," Because you have to stay close enough to pull off those additional attacks to make your power go, you know, and like you said, if everyone's doing like those dodges, like I could see like high skill PvP."
1430.28,1445.28," Yeah, being like super gratifying, especially in groups can look though like my fears like if you have like improv group and everyone you give my theme and they're also supposed to back and out, but it's clear like one of the not just one of the kids is doing his own thing, where all of the kids are doing their own thing."
1445.28,1467.28," My issue is I can't in my head make that much of a difference between, you know, starting a combo and then finishing it up with like the two things that tell you to do and like using, you know, a world locks powers to put a curse of shadows on to first drop his, you know, shadow resist is then putting a dot and then, you know, she's doing your shadow weaving with your right."
1467.28,1476.28, It's just there's still this certain order of things that has to occur to get your maximum damage output and to me it's just not that different.
1476.28,1479.28, It's hardly something like books here.
1479.28,1482.28, Shadow weaving.
1482.28,1484.28, I need to stack five shadow weave.
1484.28,1488.28," Yeah, there's a few like weird little things that trouble me about that game."
1488.28,1489.28, Like.
1489.28,1491.28, Whoa.
1492.28,1501.28, There's no log out button.
1501.28,1502.28, There's just like exit game.
1502.28,1505.28, You can't log out to the character select screen really.
1505.28,1511.28," Yeah, which you know, you might think well that's dumb even like if you're in a city or something like that."
1511.28,1512.28, I don't know.
1512.28,1515.28," I mean, if you hit escape, there's no option to just log out."
1516.28,1517.28, It's just a game.
1517.28,1526.28," It's just like it doesn't really make that big difference, but it's like, this is like this one of these little basic things that like why doesn't this game have this."
1526.28,1531.28, On the Ryan Scott review skill of how you had what the hell it not just it ever closer to the world.
1531.28,1536.28, What the hell sort of right now is it a hell yeah or what the hell was it right in the middle.
1536.28,1538.28, It's like okay.
1538.28,1541.28," Yeah, I mean, I can watch you playing it."
1541.28,1542.28, Why the hell not?
1543.28,1548.28, And you also only get a lot of help.
1548.28,1549.28, Period.
1549.28,1550.28," Yeah, that's right."
1550.28,1551.28," Oh, for all."
1551.28,1553.28, Eight characters lots period.
1553.28,1554.28, Across all servers.
1554.28,1555.28, Yeah.
1555.28,1557.28, Maybe they're going to a favor.
1557.28,1559.28, So you don't have to like do those first fucking 20.
1559.28,1560.28, But I can't.
1560.28,1561.28, I can't.
1561.28,1566.28, So because I noticed that that you pick your character and then you click on like a server or something like that.
1566.28,1570.28," Like, yeah, you can seem both, but I can't make my character go in any server though, right?"
1570.28,1571.28," No, it's a character server."
1571.28,1572.28, Can't cut to the server.
1572.28,1574.28, But that's the same on any.
1574.28,1579.28, But I'm just saying the fact that I can only have eight strains that you only have eight characters.
1579.28,1580.28, That's total.
1580.28,1581.28, Who would have more?
1581.28,1582.28, I know I can imagine.
1582.28,1583.28," Uh, I insane."
1583.28,1586.28, There are people in my wildgild that have way more than that.
1586.28,1588.28, But I know lots of people are training that you it's a complaining.
1588.28,1591.28, You only have to grind for 600 hours when you.
1591.28,1593.28," Yeah, I just know people that had strength."
1593.28,1594.28, So there's a lot of different servers.
1594.28,1598.28, So they had like a character on a bunch of different servers way more than eight.
1599.28,1600.28, I don't have that many friends.
1600.28,1601.28, People like that.
1601.28,1603.28, It's like trying new ones out.
1603.28,1604.28, But eight.
1604.28,1605.28, That's not enough.
1605.28,1606.28, Yeah.
1606.28,1607.28, We're saying like eight investment.
1607.28,1608.28, I don't know.
1608.28,1612.28, Investments to get any character to the point where you have a like I think a clean sense of how they function.
1612.28,1616.28," Yeah, but at that point, even if you hate them, you don't want to delete them because you put all that time."
1616.28,1617.28," Yeah, you might sell it."
1617.28,1618.28, Then my change it.
1618.28,1619.28, There's always that like vague.
1619.28,1622.28, What if they make this character awesome and a patch coming up?
1622.28,1624.28, So then I want to hold on to him.
1624.28,1625.28, That's weird.
1625.28,1627.28," Yeah, it's weird because there's more than eight classes."
1627.28,1628.28," One third, one third, five six."
1628.28,1629.28, And your question is what you want to create in the
1629.28,1631.28, basically I want to count Try something that you're feeling
1631.28,1634.68, out from each other for a second or another second or another second
1634.68,1635.28, third or this second.
1635.28,1637.28, Until that evening.
1637.28,1638.28,Music out.
1638.28,1641.28, So you'd also think we can create in the middle so because
1641.28,1644.28," when you're creating something different, quite a historical information of"
1644.28,1646.28, and an infinite expectation in combination.
1646.28,1648.28, That's a historical thing shortly.
1648.28,1649.54," So that very few developers I usually thought you'd insist on finding the case,"
1649.54,1652.28, and like they might not be happy to see them.
1652.28,1653.28, Are you done there?
1653.28,1654.28, A chapter nine in that is one in the house?
1654.28,1655.28,ホ pardon.
1655.28,1657.2, It's been the guilt that I've been in ever since you are.
1657.2,1660.04," We always, every game me and my buddy go to,"
1660.04,1662.76," we'll make the girl, you know."
1662.76,1665.52, They were bummed because they wanted their name was Peanorange.
1665.52,1666.36," Well, not a thing."
1666.36,1667.36, And Peanorange is the name.
1667.36,1670.28," It's like, there's that, but that one's not taken."
1670.28,1675.36," I wanted that of a, of an apparent freak with a real doll."
1675.36,1678.36, And he's wearing all orange and that Peanorange is just the color.
1678.36,1679.6399999999999, So they can take and start there.
1679.6399999999999,1682.52," And I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll save that one for you."
1682.52,1686.16," He just reminded me of the, uh, L.O.L. news story of the week."
1686.16,1688.56," They, the guy with the gamer tag."
1688.56,1689.72," Oh, who got banned?"
1689.72,1690.6, What was his name again?
1690.6,1693.8, His name was something gay with a dick gaywood.
1693.8,1698.12," And he got a, he got a notice from Xbox Live from Microsoft that his name was"
1698.12,1699.4, banned because it was offensive.
1699.4,1701.0, That was his gamer tag.
1701.0,1704.84, But that was his real name was Richard Gaywood.
1704.84,1706.96, And so Kataka reported on the story.
1706.96,1711.08," This is, it's, the apologous sort of, what made me laugh more was,"
1711.08,1714.52," I mean, that story is sort of funny in a seventh grade way, but, well, it's great."
1714.52,1716.52," It was in, in the comments to the Kataka story."
1716.52,1718.8," People were just like, there's no way this guy knew."
1718.8,1720.28, You guys there with Richard Gaywood.
1720.28,1721.28, Come on.
1721.28,1722.4399999999998, It's just not possible.
1722.4399999999998,1726.6," Well, the Richard Gaywood showed up on the threat because he was actually the one who"
1726.6,1728.84, gave Kataka the new story in the first place.
1728.84,1734.0," He, so he showed up in the threat and then he posted like a photo of his, his driver's license,"
1734.0,1735.8799999999999," you know, showing that he's Richard Gaywood."
1735.8799999999999,1739.3999999999999," I mean, he bought that his image and his address, obviously."
1739.4,1741.64, And it just turned into a really funny conversation.
1741.64,1744.2," If you go there, people are just like, dude, what's up with your parents gone?"
1744.2,1745.2, You're Richard.
1745.2,1746.2, Why didn't you?
1746.2,1747.8000000000002, I was last name at Gaywood.
1747.8000000000002,1749.48," He's like, yeah, I guess it kind of hated me."
1749.48,1750.3200000000002, Sorry.
1750.3200000000002,1751.3200000000002, I just was funny thread.
1751.3200000000002,1755.8000000000002," But it's like, why would you make, you know, that's the guy's name, whatever, but it's like,"
1755.8000000000002,1758.3600000000001," I could see Microsoft going like, well, what's this?"
1758.3600000000001,1760.44," I mean, you want to be your gamer tag."
1760.44,1761.72, I don't like this.
1761.72,1762.72, I could see this happening.
1762.72,1763.72, It's happening.
1763.72,1764.72, It's happening.
1764.72,1765.72," I mean, we've had this."
1765.72,1767.3200000000002, Because people do all kinds of crazy things.
1767.3200000000002,1768.2," Yeah, but it was like, like,"
1768.2,1770.28," character names, not permissible, though."
1770.28,1773.1200000000001," It's weird to have your gamer tag be your whole full name, though."
1773.1200000000001,1773.8400000000001," Well, that's weird."
1773.8400000000001,1775.72," I mean, which is why I could see them going like,"
1775.72,1777.16, name is not.
1777.16,1777.68, What's changed?
1777.68,1779.0, He's embracing his name.
1779.0,1781.28, That seems like something they should have investigated before
1781.28,1782.44, demanding.
1782.44,1782.96, Right.
1782.96,1783.8," Like, okay, is that really?"
1783.8,1784.0, I don't know.
1784.0,1785.0," Well, we checked your credit card."
1785.0,1785.2, Probably.
1785.2,1785.4, Probably.
1785.4,1787.52," Like an on-of-yet, it's exactly an automated program."
1787.52,1790.8400000000001," That's just like, oh, you have the word gay would in one thing, like,"
1790.8400000000001,1791.68, to close.
1791.68,1792.68, Right.
1792.68,1793.0," Like, and it is really weird."
1793.0,1795.68," Like, you can't even have fart in, like, you get my,"
1795.68,1799.48, but censored out of chat and opening a hearth.
1799.48,1801.68, I can think about ever since I read that story.
1801.68,1803.3600000000001, It's just being him.
1803.3600000000001,1806.28, I'm like the first day of class every year in school.
1806.28,1809.48," And the teacher reading the names on the roster, you know,"
1809.48,1811.48," the first day gay would,"
1811.48,1813.68, wretched and having every fucking kidding.
1813.68,1814.88," Well, they put his hand up."
1814.88,1815.88, I've ever signed a statement.
1815.88,1817.28, I'm happy when he was you.
1817.28,1821.3200000000002, I've ever seen a credit card in a grocery store where the guys last name
1821.3200000000002,1822.3200000000002, was nano-man tube.
1822.32,1826.72, I think it was like Indian or something.
1826.72,1829.76," But of course then on the thread everybody went up there with, yeah, well,"
1829.76,1831.96," when I was a kid, I knew a kid named it one of them was like,"
1831.96,1833.96," Dick Holder, the last name Holder."
1833.96,1834.56, No.
1834.56,1836.32, Does everybody had a name store like that?
1836.32,1837.6," And then there's like, well, they're all made up."
1837.6,1838.96," Harry McCryckin, right?"
1838.96,1840.6799999999998," I mean, that's a real name for that serial."
1840.6799999999998,1841.8," Well, there was a girl at my school."
1841.8,1844.08," Like, no offense to, I mean, but it's one of those names that, like,"
1844.08,1848.32," if you maybe a, maybe someone's censored, you know, automated censorship"
1848.32,1849.84, program will like that.
1849.84,1851.52," You know, our friend, Dana Jungo,"
1851.52,1853.6," where she claims, and I don't believe it in this day,"
1853.6,1857.6," that there was a girl at her school growing up with the first name Fonda,"
1857.6,1862.92," like Jane Fonda and the last name, D-I-X, D-X, Fonda Dix."
1862.92,1863.96," And I just, I don't believe it."
1863.96,1864.96, I don't believe it.
1864.96,1865.8, That's what stretch.
1865.8,1867.56, What parent would name their daughter that?
1867.56,1868.4," Dude, there was a girl."
1868.4,1869.12, He met my daughter.
1869.12,1869.96, She's Fonda Dix.
1869.96,1871.28," Oh, yeah."
1871.28,1871.96, There.
1871.96,1874.52," Well, I'm pleased to meet her."
1874.52,1876.48, What a coincidence.
1876.48,1877.48, I have one.
1877.48,1878.48, Oh.
1878.48,1879.48, Oh.
1879.48,1880.48, Oh.
1881.44,1886.08, I had a customer at Sam Goodie when I worked there who named her son Gandalf.
1886.08,1886.92, Really?
1886.92,1888.44," Well, there's a farmhouse, not good."
1888.44,1891.72, Former EGM staffer who named his son Anakin.
1891.72,1892.32, Nice.
1892.32,1895.16," And this is before, uh, tell us who."
1895.16,1896.44, His name was John Durka.
1896.44,1897.44, Oh.
1897.44,1899.3600000000001, But this is before episode one came out.
1899.3600000000001,1900.16," Oh, yeah."
1900.16,1902.0," It was, uh, universally derided."
1902.0,1904.36, So I don't know if he's got to be a handful now.
1904.36,1904.96, A name change.
1904.96,1905.96, Yeah.
1905.96,1908.12, I don't know maybe a name change.
1908.12,1911.4," There was a very, very large girl at my high school named her first name"
1911.4,1912.76, was Princess.
1912.76,1913.44, Literally.
1913.44,1915.84, And her last name was thickening Princess.
1915.84,1917.4," Oh, I am dead."
1917.4,1921.0, I will bring my fucking yearbook and show you a photo of Princess.
1921.0,1921.6, Picketing.
1921.6,1923.0, It's not.
1923.0,1925.0, Who's end with what?
1925.0,1927.68," You got to be John's new name, character name Princess."
1927.68,1928.68, Picketing.
1929.2,1930.48, It's a place of vision.
1930.48,1931.68, It's a place of vision.
1931.68,1932.8, That's a place of vision.
1932.8,1936.0, Her name would have had to have been obija on a term window.
1936.0,1940.8, On a side note that I wanted to actually ask like to run.
1940.8,1942.5600000000002," Like as far as like Conan goes,"
1942.5600000000002,1948.16, does it at all bother you how like new friendly Conan is that actually bothers me to
1948.16,1951.24, certain extent how it's like zero penalty for dying.
1951.24,1952.96, I only explain with all your equipment.
1952.96,1954.24, I'm still in the new the area.
1954.24,1955.72," Oh, you're opposite level 10."
1955.72,1958.2," Wait, and after level 10 or still no penalty."
1958.28,1959.04, Far as I know.
1959.04,1960.28, I heard there's a penalty after 10.
1960.28,1961.6000000000001," Oh, is that a really good?"
1961.6000000000001,1962.76," Oh, you leave you leave a little bit."
1962.76,1964.8400000000001, Tombstone marker where you died.
1964.8400000000001,1969.04," So, and then you get a deep off that like lowers your damage."
1969.04,1969.44," Oh, okay."
1969.44,1970.04, Good.
1970.04,1971.72, Until you go find your tombstone marker.
1971.72,1973.0, And you can actually drop like 10 to do.
1973.0,1975.24, Didn't even have to do a corpse run or anything.
1975.24,1976.56," And I was like, wow, I don't know."
1976.56,1978.0, I just to some extent.
1978.0,1983.3600000000001, I like I kind of missed the days of ever quest when I could be overburdened or like take
1983.3600000000001,1987.04, ridiculous fall damage or not have a map to tell me how to get places.
1987.04,1988.04, I die.
1988.04,1989.04, I got it.
1989.04,1991.48, You would never though you would have fun with all that.
1991.48,1994.04," The way that things are, yeah, you would never get anywhere."
1994.04,1998.92, You killed and you'd be killed on your way to your corpse run and you'd be killed
1998.92,2001.6, and there would be like until you had like an ant trail of corpses.
2001.6,2002.6, Yeah.
2002.6,2003.6, Exactly because you had to pick up the other way.
2003.6,2008.24," I mean, of course, that's before I do missed the fear of the unknown that kind"
2008.24,2009.24, of came with ever.
2009.24,2013.68, Because it just had no clue what was over there and you could feasibly lose everything
2013.68,2014.68, you had.
2014.68,2015.68," So there's just, okay, have that."
2015.68,2016.68, It would be a very tense.
2016.8,2019.76, I think the alternative today is alternative is much better.
2019.76,2020.76, Yeah.
2020.76,2024.52," It still exists to an extent where like what Rory and Duncan are already doing, where"
2024.52,2029.48," they're going into some, you know, an area where they know most people have some quest"
2029.48,2033.16, and then they wait at a certain point and it after the people felt like they have accomplished
2033.16,2035.72, the considerable amount and then they jump on them.
2035.72,2036.72, I know.
2036.72,2038.6000000000001, I think that's the part that I'm looking forward to.
2038.6000000000001,2040.1200000000001, That's probably common across.
2040.1200000000001,2045.64," Well, I mean, that's how I got gang so often and wow, on PVP services, while I was in the middle"
2045.64,2048.84, of a quest and he's fucking jerks would come up.
2048.84,2052.76," Wow, I was too busy fighting other things and my health was down by like two thirds"
2052.76,2053.76, and then they kill me.
2053.76,2056.6400000000003," Yeah, that's a part of that as part of that is design."
2056.6400000000003,2061.56," I mean, blitzer definitely did design some quests so that they would overlap and force"
2061.56,2062.56, you guys to.
2062.56,2063.56," Oh, sure."
2063.56,2064.56, The characters.
2064.56,2065.56, Yeah.
2065.56,2067.56, That's like the only interesting thing about these.
2067.56,2070.6800000000003, He eventually had as you can talk to the people you're fighting.
2070.6800000000003,2071.6800000000003," Oh, wow."
2071.6800000000003,2072.6800000000003, That's true.
2072.6800000000003,2073.6800000000003," Oh, that's great."
2073.6800000000003,2074.6800000000003, Wow.
2074.72,2075.68, The title.
2075.68,2076.68, No.
2076.68,2079.9199999999996," But still, I mean, and yeah, well, when you're doing wow, you can't even tie."
2079.9199999999996,2083.3199999999997, Battles decided in like 30 seconds and most of the time.
2083.3199999999997,2084.64," Wow, you can never tie in the title."
2084.64,2085.64, It's not a material.
2085.64,2087.12," I know, but listen, let me finish."
2087.12,2088.12," Yeah, but Sean."
2088.12,2089.12, Dot dude.
2089.12,2090.12, It doesn't.
2090.12,2094.3599999999997," So like, even if you can talk, if you lose the battle, if you go to type, you will lose"
2094.3599999999997,2098.9199999999996, unless you have a disparity between your levels like about 10 or more.
2098.9199999999996,2101.7599999999998, Because even when we went up against his level sixes and we're in battles with like
2101.76,2106.0800000000004," 18s, we would be able to kill them as a group within 30 seconds."
2106.0800000000004,2108.36," But then after you could tie, I ponder you."
2108.36,2109.36, Right.
2109.36,2110.36, That's more.
2110.36,2112.36, But then he's already.
2112.36,2114.28," You could clown, I already ponder."
2114.28,2115.28, The typing is good.
2115.28,2120.1200000000003," I think for prior to the battle, when you can establish terms, it's like, you're"
2120.1200000000003,2122.5200000000004, going to have a big part of my class.
2122.5200000000004,2126.0," What would be greatest of those like Xbox live and you could like talk to them, you"
2126.0,2127.6000000000004," know, like over speakers."
2127.6000000000004,2128.6000000000004," Fuck you, jerk."
2128.6000000000004,2129.6000000000004, Yeah.
2129.68,2133.2," Now in all the works, can you put, you couldn't do your line-cloth thing because the"
2133.2,2134.2, hard couldn't talk.
2134.2,2135.2, You can't lie on the internet.
2135.2,2136.2, Right.
2136.2,2137.88," And maybe you could, but you just, they would have no idea what you're saying and then you'd"
2137.88,2138.88, kill him.
2138.88,2139.88," Just like, it's one of the lines."
2139.88,2140.88," Like, that's right."
2140.88,2144.68," Keep looking down and walking by like that kind of, like, I'll see that kind of random"
2144.68,2145.68, shit emerge.
2145.68,2149.68," We, we, uh, yesterday when we were all playing age of Conan, we did have a moment where"
2149.68,2152.8399999999997," we all have to the Sean and like, it make fun of him sort of way."
2152.8399999999997,2157.48," But in the end, we were only really making fun of ourselves because, because like,"
2157.48,2158.48, after I logged off.
2158.48,2162.56," No, because when Sean went to like hit a scape as like, how come it didn't pause the"
2162.56,2163.56, game?
2163.56,2168.2," And we were like, and ever, and Duncan, like, just went to NEMMO Sean and and"
2168.2,2170.28," Sean was like, but I'm in an instance."
2170.28,2173.84," And like, I just remember everyone laughed like, he doesn't know."
2173.84,2175.68, He doesn't know that it doesn't pause in instance.
2175.68,2179.0," And then I was like, but it wasn't just like, it was a single player instance."
2179.0,2180.0, So that's what I'm saying.
2180.0,2181.96," But at the same time, like, even though we were like, ha, what,"
2181.96,2184.8," we were like, wait, who are making fun of you for that?"
2184.8,2185.32, I know.
2185.32,2186.52, I'm making fun of myself.
2186.52,2187.52, Yeah.
2187.52,2189.52, That's the irony.
2189.52,2191.0, Age of Conan.
2191.0,2192.36," Well, learn something."
2192.36,2194.36, You just really though.
2194.36,2197.52," How would you, how excited are you to play?"
2197.52,2198.52, No.
2198.52,2201.8," Uh, I might get, come up and see you, Abija."
2201.8,2202.8, It's not pretty hot.
2202.8,2203.8, That's not much.
2203.8,2205.8, Have you ever played in MMO?
2205.8,2210.44," Um, I played the ultimate online a long time ago just for a little while with a friend"
2210.44,2214.6," of mine because he, like, back in Florida and we were just walking around this world and"
2214.6,2216.48, we came into this house.
2216.48,2217.48, And it was full.
2217.48,2219.2000000000003, It was filled wall to wall with dudes.
2219.2000000000003,2220.2000000000003, And it was weird.
2220.2000000000003,2223.48," They were all like, I don't know what was going on."
2223.48,2224.48," Someone was like, storing characters."
2224.48,2225.48, I had no idea.
2225.48,2226.48, I was all in New World of Me.
2226.48,2230.28, But they were all like doing their walk animation in place in this house and we were
2230.28,2231.68," just like, what the hell's going on?"
2231.68,2232.68, It's just a little bit of a thought.
2232.68,2234.48, I think I've ever figured out what was going on.
2234.48,2235.48, No.
2235.48,2236.48," People in Mac are all like, scared me."
2236.48,2237.48, Yeah.
2237.48,2239.2000000000003, It's scared me away from MMOs for life.
2239.2,2240.4399999999996," But I do remember, I liked that game."
2240.4399999999996,2243.24," If you took your shoes off and walked away, it looked like you took a dump."
2243.24,2245.24, So I enjoyed that.
2245.24,2246.24," We were kind of like, I'm kidding."
2246.24,2247.24," We were kind of like, I'm kidding."
2247.24,2248.24, The graphics.
2248.24,2249.24, That was your trademark.
2249.24,2251.24, I'm sure that was the name takes off his shoes and walks away.
2251.24,2253.24, Sure that was Richard Gary's design document.
2253.24,2255.24, I want you to do it here.
2255.24,2256.24, He pulls the paper.
2256.24,2257.24, I don't know.
2257.24,2258.24, I don't know.
2258.24,2259.24, He was such a hay seed.
2259.24,2262.24, He is in my imitation of him.
2262.24,2264.24, He's like an astronaut.
2264.24,2266.24," Well, he thinks."
2266.24,2269.16," So Ryan, do you have other, uh,"
2269.16,2274.16, you had to give other points about what you're not liking?
2274.16,2280.16," Uh, because I'll think all you mentioned was the pause or the long enough screen."
2280.16,2281.16, There's that.
2281.16,2283.16, There was like the character slots.
2283.16,2284.16, All right.
2284.16,2285.16, What else was I gonna say?
2285.16,2287.16, What do you like?
2287.16,2292.16, The combat seems more engaging than your tip of the world.
2292.16,2293.16, Okay.
2293.16,2294.16, So pros may lay combat.
2294.16,2295.16, Yeah.
2295.16,2296.16, Final score.
2296.16,2297.16, I really did feel I made a mistake.
2297.16,2300.16, I think making such a castor type in this game.
2300.16,2302.16," Like, I normally, that's what I flock to all the time."
2302.16,2306.16," But after high demand in the PvP servers, I bet they are because they're just watered"
2306.16,2307.16, and they're barring.
2307.16,2312.16," What water is the means of escape for like, you know, in most times when someone's"
2312.16,2317.16," someone's ganging up on you and if they're largely melee, you jump in the water and they can't do anything."
2317.16,2319.16," Oh, is there a stockpile for something?"
2319.16,2321.16, You just couldn't water and they can't do shit.
2321.16,2322.16," Yeah, just go out and wait."
2322.16,2323.16, Really?
2323.16,2325.16, So there's always a bunch of people hanging out more than the water.
2325.16,2326.16," Hey, like a public pool."
2326.16,2330.16," But if you have a lot of people, if they go stay in a while, if you have a range, then you can just"
2330.16,2331.16," like, cool."
2331.16,2332.16, You're pacing angrily on the shore.
2332.16,2335.16, And they have to go out deeper and dive under.
2335.16,2336.16, So it's great.
2336.16,2340.16," Like, if you can be the one that finishes like when you see everyone running for the beach,"
2340.16,2341.16," it's like inverse jaws, you know."
2341.16,2343.16, You see everyone running for the beach.
2343.16,2346.16, You can just sit there and hit him in the ass with your fireballs and stuff and hopefully
2346.16,2347.16, kill him.
2347.16,2349.16, But aren't there a basin in the water that'll reach you?
2349.16,2350.16, No.
2350.16,2353.16," In fact, the crocodiles won't chase you in the water."
2354.16,2355.16, It's a while.
2355.16,2356.16, In the magical world of Conan.
2356.16,2357.16, Yeah.
2357.16,2359.16, And they're trying to add out the lure.
2359.16,2361.16," I mean, sir, I like it."
2361.16,2362.16, It doesn't matter.
2362.16,2363.16, I don't know.
2363.16,2367.16, It also doesn't like the launches and going so smooth.
2367.16,2368.16, It's not going so smooth.
2368.16,2369.16, I like to do some show and tell.
2369.16,2373.16, They do sort of the ultimate online thing with their downtime.
2373.16,2375.16, Like you'll see in like the server status forum.
2375.16,2376.16, Yeah.
2376.16,2379.16, They're like the servers are going to be down for five hours and a five hour.
2379.16,2380.16," Well, it's like we need another hour."
2380.16,2381.16, And then we need another hour.
2381.16,2382.16, And then we need another hour.
2383.16,2384.16, Early days.
2384.16,2386.16," But I'm like, it's hasn't been a week."
2386.16,2389.16," I'd say, you know, we's a few day grace period for them."
2389.16,2390.16, The iron the kinks out.
2390.16,2392.16, And then we could start ragging on them for that.
2392.16,2394.16, People are making animals for 10 years.
2394.16,2395.16, They shouldn't have.
2395.16,2397.16," In theory, it should be perfect."
2397.16,2398.16, They never are.
2398.16,2399.16," Wow, certainly was not."
2399.16,2400.16," Wow, was a mess."
2400.16,2402.16," Well, I mean, not like seven."
2402.16,2403.16, Seven hours a week.
2403.16,2404.16, It's down to.
2404.16,2405.16, Yeah.
2405.16,2406.16, It is down today.
2406.16,2407.16, Right.
2407.16,2408.16," Are they planning to like,"
2408.16,2410.16, and I can't comp you any time for that usually.
2410.16,2413.16, And then the result is that's what can you admire to smart companies will come up.
2413.16,2416.16," Blizzard, the only company I've ever seen do that."
2416.16,2422.16," Really before we before we move on to Chris, been showing us how I do."
2422.16,2423.16," So say like, I'm excited."
2423.16,2427.16," Wait till next week, actually, having playing a lot of other games and no shun,"
2427.16,2429.16," saw some two, but they're all like a margo thing."
2429.16,2431.16," So it's like, don't over to you."
2431.16,2432.16, We'll be able to talk about next week.
2432.16,2436.16," Stockard Clear Sky, which looked really, really cool."
2436.16,2437.16, Same same there.
2437.16,2440.16," I've been playing battlefield, bad company."
2440.16,2442.16," And you say whether Donna Portue, look cooler or not."
2442.16,2443.16, Is that I'm sure I can.
2443.16,2445.16," Yeah, it looked really cool to me."
2445.16,2447.16, I'm no very excited for it.
2447.16,2452.16," But, um, and with that, the way Chrisman has got."
2452.16,2454.16, Trying to get people to.
2454.16,2455.16, What's your story?
2455.16,2456.16, I didn't know about this.
2456.16,2457.16, What did you bring?
2457.16,2458.16, I just brought it.
2458.16,2463.16," Well, at each gym, we recently moved to a different part of the office."
2463.16,2465.16, We had to clean out a lot of cabinets.
2465.16,2467.16, And there's been like a long history.
2467.16,2473.16," I think, especially between Shonai, making fun of peripherals that actually add more work than what they're supposed to do."
2473.16,2479.16," And they all seem to revolve around the, the, uh, Game Boy family of portables."
2479.16,2485.16," There was like that thing that you could hook it up and put three cartridges in, but it was like the size of 20 cartridges."
2485.16,2487.16, This is the cartridge change.
2487.16,2488.16," Yeah, the cartridge change."
2488.16,2492.16," And then there was something called the game chamber, which you could hold."
2492.16,2495.16, Your DS games and DS games are about the size of your thumbnail.
2495.16,2498.16," And this thing was about as big as it, I don't know, like a tape measure."
2498.16,2504.16," It was used like, or like if you get like a catering thing of like shrimp cocktail, you know, with the cartel sauce in the middle and the shrimp sauce around it."
2504.16,2506.16, This is about as big as you can maybe.
2506.16,2508.16, It's about as big as some barrel.
2508.16,2509.16, Yeah.
2509.16,2511.16, It helps six DS games.
2511.16,2513.16, And you can only put it.
2513.16,2516.16," You can only take out one if you put in one, if you put one in."
2516.16,2521.16," So if you lost a game, you had like five games locked for ever and the game turned it."
2521.16,2526.16," And I guess you said, you said back to them and they would they would extract the games from your game series."
2526.16,2527.16, I'm serious.
2527.16,2530.16, So this thing would only work if you had six DS games.
2530.16,2532.16," Yeah, it came with seven."
2532.16,2533.16, We get to buy another game.
2533.16,2536.16," God, but then you'd have to buy six more games after that."
2536.16,2538.16, Or five more games.
2538.16,2540.16, I think it's my God live points.
2540.16,2542.16, It might be soft money or whatever.
2542.16,2544.16, Would you try to buy it downloadable game?
2544.16,2545.16, I have 20 left.
2545.16,2548.16, It came with the little plastic things that were the size of DS games that you could put in.
2548.16,2549.16," Oh, I see."
2549.16,2550.16, I see.
2550.16,2553.16," But if you lost any of those, you were fucked."
2553.16,2554.16, Wow.
2554.16,2556.16, So I found this thing looking through.
2556.16,2558.16," It's called, it's got a really nice packaging."
2558.16,2559.16, It's called the pack.
2559.16,2560.16, The battery pack.
2560.16,2562.16, But it's it's PAK.
2562.16,2563.16, So it's something special.
2563.16,2564.16, And that's trademarked.
2564.16,2565.16, It's trademarked.
2565.16,2569.16," You don't know that it also has the innovation seal of quality, which is a sealed balancing area."
2569.16,2570.16, A clipart seal.
2570.16,2572.16, And it's made by a company.
2572.16,2573.16, It's made by the company.
2573.16,2574.16, It's made by the company.
2574.16,2575.16," Yeah, by the company."
2575.16,2578.16," We have the, we have bestowed the seal upon it."
2578.16,2582.16, This looks like it could have been anything in the dollar general like a box at Nag Champa
2582.16,2585.16, In-sense or anything.
2585.16,2586.16," So, okay."
2586.16,2587.16, So what?
2587.16,2589.16, So it's a battery pack for the original Game Boy.
2589.16,2592.16, This is like the one that came out maybe the same thing.
2592.16,2596.16, So the original Game Boy took like what four AAAs.
2596.16,2598.16, How much do you think a AAA is?
2598.16,2599.16, I don't know.
2599.16,2600.16, It's like a few ounces.
2600.16,2601.16, Right.
2601.16,2603.16, This thing probably is almost a pound.
2603.16,2604.16, A plastic.
2604.16,2606.16, That you set your Game Boy in.
2607.16,2611.16, And it extends it by good four inches.
2611.16,2614.16, How long does it extend the battery life?
2614.16,2615.16," Well, it's rechargeable."
2615.16,2617.16, I think it probably lasts about an hour.
2617.16,2618.16, But it's rechargeable.
2618.16,2620.16, So you could actually over 500 times too.
2620.16,2621.16, Yeah.
2621.16,2622.16, And we haven't used it once.
2622.16,2624.16, So we're still at the beginning of this thing's light.
2624.16,2625.16," Oh, wow."
2625.16,2627.16, For the original Game Boy.
2627.16,2628.16, For the original Game Boy.
2628.16,2629.16, Right.
2629.16,2631.16," And yeah, it doesn't do anything else."
2631.16,2635.16, It just does a giant battery that hooks to your Game Boy.
2635.16,2639.16, There was a lot of other crap for the Game Boy that would add like four
2639.16,2641.16, out speakers and magnifying lights.
2641.16,2643.16, That was the best.
2643.16,2644.16," You know, I know."
2644.16,2645.16, I got light.
2645.16,2646.16, So you guys just took a couple of weeks ago.
2646.16,2650.16, I was at a park in the East Bay.
2650.16,2652.16, And you had to go through like an entrance.
2652.16,2655.16," It was like a pay, you know, park regional park."
2655.16,2659.16, And the guy at the booth was playing an original Game Boy.
2659.16,2661.16, So maybe he would actually like the pass.
2661.16,2662.16, Was he homeless?
2662.16,2664.16," No, he was like the guy manning the booth."
2664.16,2666.16," He was like some kid who's like summer dober, whatever."
2666.16,2667.16, Not summer.
2667.16,2670.16," He was playing like the Game Boy, the black and white one."
2670.16,2671.16, The old dick.
2671.16,2672.16, The old dick.
2672.16,2674.16," And I said, he had no sense of humor too."
2674.16,2675.16," Because I like walked in and I go like,"
2675.16,2677.16, That's awesome.
2677.16,2679.16," And he just looked at me like, what?"
2679.16,2681.16, Like what's your prof fucking problem?
2681.16,2683.16," Like, it's a sad and object."
2683.16,2684.16," It's a ridiculous, dude."
2684.16,2689.16, We got in the video that we're putting up for the podcast blog.
2689.16,2691.16, It starts off with the shot of this postcard from where's that.
2691.16,2694.16, Chris and Preston Patterson California.
2694.16,2698.16, The beautiful thing is that Michael Donho was it's some gas station in
2698.16,2699.16, Tanko Patterson.
2699.16,2702.16, And all the town was it was like a waste station.
2702.16,2704.16," Yeah, like one of those many on, you know,"
2704.16,2707.16, Interstate five in Central California where they have a Jack in a box.
2707.16,2711.16, Like a BP gas station and maybe like a best Western.
2711.16,2712.16, And that's really it.
2712.16,2715.16," So the postcard it had cells and it was, you know,"
2715.16,2717.16, is broken up into pictures of the town of the panorama.
2717.16,2720.16, But like had the same Jack in a box twice.
2720.16,2723.16, Because there's all their things to show.
2723.16,2726.16, It's up in MD field in the Jack and a box and then the pattern.
2726.16,2727.16, It's on five.
2727.16,2729.16," Yes, it was at a joke like where they made it."
2729.16,2730.16," No, it was not a joke."
2730.16,2734.16," Well, you got to think it was, but when Michael bought him, he bought two of them."
2734.16,2736.16," And he was like, all happy and pleased."
2736.16,2737.16, I thought it was so awesome.
2737.16,2738.16, And he said the clerk was not amused.
2738.16,2741.16," It's like, that's a fucking, that's his town man."
2741.16,2742.16," He's just like, my town."
2742.16,2744.16, And how big misspelling on the back to it.
2744.16,2745.16," Said it was the,"
2745.16,2746.16," Oh, no."
2746.16,2748.16," Like, uh, Artichoke Capital of the world,"
2748.16,2752.16, but world with spelled W R O L D R All.
2752.16,2754.16, Maybe it was all a joke.
2754.16,2758.16," You could, well, that, you know, that was the connection is that that effect."
2758.16,2761.16," Like, when he described it to me, he was probably already in the point when he was"
2761.16,2763.16," embellishing a story again, more mild,"
2763.16,2767.16," Janet, in the retelling and it was like that he went up to the counter was laughing."
2767.16,2770.16," And he put the card up to the guy in the guy was just like,"
2770.16,2772.16, at that that's when he was not amused about.
2772.16,2774.16," So it's like, was he playing on old game boy?"
2774.16,2775.16, That's the equivalent.
2775.16,2777.16, Maybe he thought that the whole town was happy.
2777.16,2780.16," Like, laughing after after Donna Hudrow off, they all laughed."
2780.16,2782.16, People I want to vote.
2782.16,2784.16, The joke is on Donna Hudrow.
2784.16,2785.16, I don't know.
2785.16,2786.16, There's something about it.
2786.16,2789.16," The back, the text that they have describing the town,"
2789.16,2790.16, it seemed pretty sincere.
2790.16,2794.16," Yeah, I think it's so, there might be listeners from Patterson right now."
2794.16,2797.16," If there are the Patterson's, the population's six dude."
2797.16,2798.16," No, no, no."
2798.16,2799.16," It's probably isn't a list of the,"
2799.16,2802.16," I was at the, says if some it yesterday up in, uh, in Napa,"
2802.16,2805.16, and we read this bogus fake castle.
2805.16,2808.16," And they served us a wine in the wine guy,"
2808.16,2810.16," recognized me, the wine server."
2810.16,2811.16, Really?
2811.16,2812.16, Yeah.
2812.16,2813.16, Really?
2813.16,2814.16," Yeah, even though you're not the dean."
2814.16,2816.16, I wasn't the dean.
2816.16,2819.16," Yeah, but he did ask if I wrote for EDM."
2819.16,2820.16," Well, it's close."
2820.16,2821.16, Close enough.
2821.16,2822.16, Close enough.
2822.16,2823.16, You'll take it.
2823.16,2824.16, That was nice.
2824.16,2825.16, There's a lot of comics there for you.
2825.16,2826.16, You do write for EDM now.
2826.16,2827.16, I do.
2827.16,2828.16, Yeah.
2828.16,2829.16, Those are red.
2829.16,2830.16," He's like, dude, I know you and you're like, oh, yeah."
2830.16,2831.16, Cool.
2831.16,2833.16," He's like, you're not going to break up the fantastic for."
2834.16,2836.16, What are you saying?
2836.16,2837.16, Sorry.
2837.16,2839.16, You thought you were Richard Reed or something?
2839.16,2842.16," Who ever that other guy is that like, I think I'm Nick Ferry."
2842.16,2843.16, Yeah.
2843.16,2845.16, I think Jeff looks more like Scott Bacchula.
2845.16,2847.16," Uh, I get that too sometimes."
2847.16,2848.16, Yeah.
2848.16,2850.16," That'd be term and monster because that's like,"
2850.16,2852.16," Oh, that's the other one I get."
2852.16,2854.16," Hey, guys, said that to me on email."
2854.16,2855.16," And I was like, gee, thanks, lying."
2855.16,2856.16," He's like, what?"
2856.16,2859.16, What do you mean by a water?
2859.16,2860.16, Water?
2860.16,2861.16," I mean, water."
2861.16,2863.16," I mean, like, some like 60 year old monster."
2863.16,2866.16, Did he have like a round face?
2866.16,2867.16, Yeah.
2867.16,2869.16," And like, Walter Mathowski, other one I got one time."
2869.16,2871.16," Oh, the cat got two."
2871.16,2872.16, Thanks.
2872.16,2873.16, Jake Logan.
2873.16,2874.16, Great to me.
2874.16,2876.16, This is ultimately moved on from who I look like.
2876.16,2879.16, Are you going to put a picture of this.
2879.16,2881.16," Is it the pack, the battery pack?"
2881.16,2882.16," Yeah, the battery pack."
2882.16,2883.16, I can't put that on the wall.
2883.16,2886.16," Oh, I wish we'd worked it into this interpretive dance movie thing."
2886.16,2887.16, Yeah.
2887.16,2888.16, So it's not the pack.
2888.16,2889.16, The battery pack.
2889.16,2890.16, The battery pack.
2890.16,2893.16, The battery word battery kind of disappears from the font.
2893.16,2896.16," Yeah, I thought it was battery at the pack."
2896.16,2902.16," You know what hasn't got enough shit is like, Xbox 360 face plays."
2902.16,2904.16, Remember when that was like this.
2904.16,2905.16," Oh, yeah."
2905.16,2907.16, I advertised aspect of the platform when it came out.
2907.16,2912.16, And then now it's essentially all it's there for us so that like Madcats and
2912.16,2913.16, night go or whatever.
2913.16,2915.16," Well, and recycle some more."
2915.16,2916.16, They're like aquafeta bottles.
2916.16,2917.16, That.
2917.16,2918.16, And pay for that.
2918.16,2921.16, And so that they can give you like it's he's the pre-order of a bunch of games.
2921.16,2922.16, It's like the yeah.
2922.16,2923.16, Yeah.
2923.16,2924.16, It's a regular pre-order.
2924.16,2925.16, Yeah.
2925.16,2929.16," Well, you laugh, but Dan Schu, former editorial director, has a collection of them."
2929.16,2930.16, But on display.
2930.16,2933.16, I'm sure that it's in serial collection like it's in.
2933.16,2936.16," Well, it's in serial collection, but this because we all work at a place where these things"
2936.16,2937.16, are falling from the sky.
2937.16,2938.16, Right.
2938.16,2940.16, It's not like you have to work hard to have a collection of them.
2940.16,2941.16, That's just happening.
2941.16,2944.16," Like, like, I'm sure Jeff's daughter's gotten equivalent."
2944.16,2945.16, We're.
2945.16,2949.16, So when in the family gets a kid like a stuffed hippopotamus.
2949.16,2952.16," And then so when's like, oh, she's in a stuffed hippopotamus."
2952.16,2953.16, Yeah.
2953.16,2956.16," Five years later, they got this enormous collection of stuff hippopotamus."
2956.16,2958.16," You're like, so what is it you like about him?"
2958.16,2959.16, I'm kind of up in the house.
2959.16,2960.16," We had like, yeah, I can."
2960.16,2961.16, You're right.
2961.16,2966.16, That's like little rubber pigs or something on our mirror and the bathroom.
2966.16,2969.16, So all this pig shit starts showing up.
2969.16,2970.16, I hope not literally.
2970.16,2971.16," No, no, no, no."
2971.16,2973.16, That was that was different.
2973.16,2975.16," Sean and Keith like, pig shit."
2975.16,2976.16, I think it was bad.
2976.16,2977.16, Send him a box.
2977.16,2979.16," See, here's a pig puppet."
2979.16,2980.16," You like pigs, right?"
2980.16,2981.16, Like not.
2981.16,2982.16, Really?
2982.16,2984.16, That way with manatees.
2984.16,2985.16, Oh.
2985.16,2989.16," Well, I had my ex girlfriend was and I had manatees shit hanging up."
2989.16,2992.16," And once we broke up and she moved out, I just kind of left it hanging up."
2992.16,2996.16, And I just kind of forgot about it because on your walls and you don't really think about
2996.16,2997.16, it.
2997.16,3000.16," You know, I started seeing other people and now I have another new girlfriend and she's like,"
3000.16,3003.16," find out she's asked me like, what's with all these manatees everywhere?"
3003.16,3008.16," And I'm like, oh, oh, yeah, I guess, I guess, I'm just making something up there."
3008.16,3011.16, Sailors used to think they were Mr. Manatee.
3011.16,3015.16," Like your secret here, I'd never have a violent painting."
3015.16,3018.16," Uh, yeah, I think we probably did a one or two other."
3018.16,3019.16, You did.
3019.16,3020.16," Yeah, you should."
3020.16,3021.16, And you waste.
3021.16,3022.16, What should I do?
3022.16,3023.16, Muffin' about that.
3023.16,3027.16," But also like you were your version was like, you know, pirates for some time."
3027.16,3030.16," But I think now it's just, it's just the trash can."
3030.16,3034.16, It's like if you have anything you don't want or that you think would like make your
3034.16,3040.16," office or your home, like, noticeably less cool or comfortable."
3040.16,3042.16, It's all for irony.
3042.16,3043.16, They get to the police.
3043.16,3045.16, It's from the Walgreens season a while.
3045.16,3047.16, I have a home for it.
3047.16,3049.16, Were you the one to put the Brittany frog in the office?
3049.16,3051.16, Cause it magically showed up on warning.
3051.16,3052.16," Uh, as probably Sean."
3052.16,3053.16," Oh, Sean."
3053.16,3054.16," Yeah, you did."
3054.16,3055.16, Cause Chris from hood of my house.
3055.16,3056.16," Chris, cause I'm not."
3056.16,3059.16," Yeah, cause Sean's got like, you're a loving collection of like really high end"
3059.16,3061.16, dolls in airplanes.
3061.16,3066.16," So I took, when I was cleaning my house, they took all this shit, like all this cheesy shit"
3066.16,3069.16," and put it in next to all of his, his, uh, whatever you got."
3069.16,3072.16, It's just a bucket and the pictures of bats from the shit.
3072.16,3074.16, He's wrapping it like all over.
3074.16,3079.16," You're on a, you're on like a, a sea cucumber thing."
3079.16,3082.16, I've a rubber sea cucumber off my light.
3082.16,3085.16," I was, I was horrified, but it's like every day I come in."
3085.16,3088.16, Someone put a fucking snott rag that they blown their nose in.
3088.16,3090.16, Like right by my keyboard.
3090.16,3091.16, Was that me?
3091.16,3093.16, That's that was his long.
3093.16,3096.16," I had to get like a, what do you mean that's like a dirty clean."
3096.16,3097.16, X-hand.
3097.16,3098.16, Yeah.
3098.16,3101.16," I had to get like a, like, scoot it off like, table into the trash."
3101.16,3102.16, Excretions are not allowed.
3102.16,3105.16, I think this was like your second life behavior coming back to hot you.
3105.16,3108.16," Is somebody you like, uh, I still have this thing."
3108.16,3109.16, I've been in a tar.
3109.16,3117.16," We're like, because I moved you know, I moved from my old cube, you know, across the way and like I'll come back and it's just, you know, habit and I'll go to sit down in my old place."
3117.16,3123.16," I'll see you now and I'll be like, oh shit, like I'll have this immediate, like nervous reaction of like, what the fuck happened here."
3123.16,3127.16, Because someone else moved in there and it's a big shitty mess.
3127.16,3128.16," And then I'm like, oh, okay."
3128.16,3129.16, That's all.
3129.16,3130.16, I really liked it.
3130.16,3135.16, Robert coffee's old cube and this is a long time ago because he went from a cube then to an office.
3135.16,3148.16," So years ago when he got this cubicle is right outside of my office, he Robert had some some interesting and strange hobbies and sessions and one of them was he had this collection of serial killer playing cards."
3148.16,3163.16," And at one point he put them up, you know, on the window all around his cube wall and with this great because, you know, he's a great guy, but he's, you know, he's intense and he's kind of scaring and intimidating and I remember when he first put him up, you know, the HR person actually can me in this like,"
3163.16,3165.16, do we need to worry about that?
3165.16,3167.16, It's really okay.
3167.16,3174.16," He's not, I don't think he worshiped serial killers and maybe he does, but I don't think he's going to actually act out."
3174.16,3175.16, So you're safe.
3175.16,3178.16," But anyway, those things are still, but that's what I was getting to."
3178.16,3180.16, That's why he's the copy of the he left.
3180.16,3181.16," Yeah, he left."
3181.16,3186.16, If David's a long time ago and every other person who's ever worked in there has never taken the serial killer cards down.
3186.16,3187.16, I was in that one.
3187.16,3189.16," Yeah, they were now writing to the audience."
3189.16,3194.16," Now they're now the copy chief that had the copy desk, a Sydney there and he's like the most mild man or guy."
3194.16,3198.16," You know, I had been wanting to ask him, I do even know that these are there."
3198.16,3202.16," Like anybody who, because anybody came to the office now, it was just assumed they were his."
3202.16,3204.16," Like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's always your copy of the film."
3204.16,3207.16," Oh, he's a, he's a quiet normal guy and it's always the normal quiet."
3207.16,3208.16," Oh, you're right."
3208.16,3210.16," Maybe he's the one who's like, yeah."
3210.16,3213.16," To me, it felt like that surface that they were on was not my property."
3213.16,3215.16," It felt like I mean, I fucked that."
3215.16,3216.16, I tore all that shit down.
3216.16,3217.16, It's on the outside of my cube.
3217.16,3218.16, Yeah.
3218.16,3219.16, They had a bunch of stuff too.
3219.16,3220.16, Star Wars posters and stuff.
3220.16,3221.16," Yeah, that's right."
3221.16,3222.16, I know how you hate it.
3222.16,3224.16," Yeah, I just wanted to say."
3224.16,3226.16," Yeah, serial killer cards are kind of cool."
3226.16,3227.16, So I left in there.
3227.16,3228.16, I have a frame though.
3228.16,3240.16, I do now have the frame picture screen cap from Kung Fu for Nintendo of when in that game when the enemies went like it was called Kung Fu is kind of a misnomer because they would just grab you.
3240.16,3245.16," But then they would grab you and then if one of them was already grabbing you, they'd grab the guy who was grabbing you."
3245.16,3248.16, So the trick was you get like six of them deep going.
3248.16,3254.16, And then you hit print screen and put it in a picture frame.
3254.16,3255.16, Though I made this shit open.
3255.16,3256.16, You like five years ago.
3256.16,3257.16, I know.
3257.16,3260.16," I remember I told you you're like, what the fuck?"
3260.16,3262.16," It's like, right, you were still in the internal mic."
3262.16,3264.16, I need a screenshot.
3264.16,3265.16, That's okay.
3265.16,3266.16, But that was like good.
3266.16,3267.16, I remember we used to.
3267.16,3268.16, Now I'm gonna picture frame.
3268.16,3270.16, What was Kung Fu man?
3270.16,3271.16, Can I get one?
3271.16,3272.16, That sounds cool.
3273.16,3274.16, Should open up.
3274.16,3275.16, Kiosk in the mall.
3275.16,3276.16, It's all this.
3276.16,3277.16, Good idea.
3277.16,3280.16," Once again, we've arrived at a point out in the how we got here."
3280.16,3281.16, I don't even went down some bars.
3281.16,3282.16, So I wrote.
3282.16,3284.16, What don't look bad Jeff?
3284.16,3285.16, Huh?
3285.16,3286.16, Come.
3286.16,3287.16, It's a.
3287.16,3288.16, It's a wow shirt.
3288.16,3289.16, It's a world of war crafter.
3289.16,3291.16, How does that make you feel?
3291.16,3293.16, It's a small camp in the barrens.
3293.16,3294.16, Yeah.
3294.16,3295.16, The John lights.
3295.16,3296.16, He's acting out.
3296.16,3297.16, They told it off.
3297.16,3299.16, It looks like it is an old.
3299.16,3301.16," You know, like a shirt, a thrift or shirt from."
3301.16,3302.16, Yeah.
3302.16,3305.16," Now, this is like one of the wow shirts I don't mind wearing of the 12."
3305.16,3307.16," Well, I don't know."
3307.16,3308.16, That you don't want.
3308.16,3310.16, I can wear a public and most people don't think it's like a gaming shirt.
3310.16,3312.16, They need like a fake like to date.
3312.16,3313.16, It's like a cool front.
3313.16,3314.16, Co do country.
3314.16,3315.16, Yeah.
3315.16,3317.16, It's like one of my aunt's.
3317.16,3320.16," He's just shirt and I say, oh, you went to camp."
3320.16,3322.16," Where's that camp, man?"
3322.16,3323.16, I never heard of that one.
3323.16,3325.16, Is that like your daughter's music camp.
3325.16,3329.16," Do the one with the, with the 12 K corpse on and make her think that you're like athletic"
3329.16,3330.16, and then you're out.
3330.16,3333.16," Yeah, they, they, they go to look at me."
3333.16,3334.16, I'm not athletic.
3334.16,3337.16," Well, I say, well, you can be, you're out running."
3337.16,3338.16," Yeah, whatever."
3338.16,3340.16, That's a move on.
3340.16,3341.16, What else?
3341.16,3343.16, Do we have anything else this week?
3343.16,3345.16," Oh, I was going to tell you one more thing, Sean."
3345.16,3347.16, One more random thing with this.
3347.16,3352.16," At this summit, I was at that different people speaking from the, from the game"
3352.16,3353.16, industry.
3353.16,3355.16, Don't look like I'm going to tell great story because it's not.
3355.16,3356.16, You're really looking excited.
3356.16,3359.16," That was just one moment where this, this woman."
3359.16,3364.16," This, this, this, this, this, exactly woman was just talking about, you know, virtual world"
3364.16,3370.16," or whatever and she talked about, you know, how even she has a character in, in a virtual world"
3370.16,3371.16, called second life.
3371.16,3375.16," And then, you know, there's big screen, big property screen came up and, and she said,"
3375.16,3378.16," and here's my character and she just showed her character, second life."
3378.16,3383.16," No, but I, that was an, you know, Xademian land, the executive producer of, of game"
3383.16,3384.16, videos.
3384.16,3385.16," And I just had man, the screenshot."
3385.16,3386.16, So needs more Sean Elliott.
3387.16,3391.16," You know, you just look at this woman and she would like put herself in like in a business suit on this sidewalk"
3391.16,3395.16, with other business like a people and it's so needed like flying penis is behind there.
3395.16,3398.16, This is where my character just standing beside it.
3398.16,3402.16, That's why it was so see because people treat their characters as seriously.
3402.16,3406.16," Well, that was a thing with her talk was like, and now second life is a place where business"
3406.16,3410.16," people can go and meet and that that's, it was a, that exact moment was like, no."
3410.16,3413.16, We need Sean's troops to come in right now.
3413.16,3415.16," You can, I fucking lady."
3415.16,3417.16, We don't even need to say anything. You just walk in.
3417.16,3419.16, Leading the journey.
3419.16,3429.16, What's the better barbarian game age of Conan or second life?
3429.16,3432.16," You know, I think it's probably a lot more fun than second life."
3432.16,3434.16," To be honest, I had a lot more fun in the second."
3434.16,3435.16," And the hours, I spent a second."
3435.16,3437.16," Yes, but that was your emergent gameplay."
3437.16,3442.16," The in Conan, you'd probably have to grind for like six weeks to get like seven days to hang out for a face."
3442.16,3445.16, You can't even get a face.
3445.16,3448.16, You can't even get a face.
3448.16,3450.16, You can't get a face.
3450.16,3455.16," I don't feel, because the end is that you're marking the devil."
3455.16,3458.16, That wasn't the head to these characters.
3458.16,3459.16, It was still a clip.
3459.16,3462.16," I just bought a ton of, I attended it."
3462.16,3463.16, You got about the freebie boy.
3463.16,3466.16," Yeah, and I touched, I touched him to every attachable point."
3466.16,3468.16, I looked like a penis cutout.
3468.16,3470.16, It's so red that you'll be in the mall.
3470.16,3473.16," It'll be kind of like, it's kind of like smoking."
3473.16,3475.16, You don't want your your patience.
3475.16,3477.16," You know, it's garipote smoking in your shop."
3477.16,3479.16," So like we were in like the dick mall and we were like,"
3479.16,3480.16, I know.
3480.16,3483.16," And we'd hang them on her face and it'd be like, you got to take that off."
3483.16,3485.16, Or then the like the mall cops would kick us out.
3485.16,3487.16, It was like you could buy the dick.
3487.16,3488.16, It's like what are like weed rules.
3488.16,3489.16, You could buy it there.
3489.16,3492.16," You could sell it, which you just can't wear it."
3492.16,3494.16, That's reasonable.
3494.16,3497.16, Funcom might add this question now.
3497.16,3498.16, They're going to hear it.
3498.16,3500.16, We got to add this.
3500.16,3501.16, We'll show him.
3501.16,3503.16, We said we were going to have to climb up six weeks.
3503.16,3504.16, Yeah.
3504.16,3506.16," Oh, no, you don't."
3506.16,3510.16," See, if second life had like a good, if it had PvP."
3510.16,3513.16," No, no, seriously, it would be incredible."
3513.16,3518.16," Because you wouldn't just have the limit of your, your, your social experimentation"
3518.16,3520.16," couldn't just be who are we going to gain, you know,"
3520.16,3523.16," right, but like how are we, what aligns is we're going to form."
3523.16,3525.16," And then also intra alliance like issues about like, you know,"
3525.16,3527.16, who's going to be the leader in this nap.
3527.16,3532.16," But I mean, then you have like the stuff with real estate, with property, all that just regular socialization."
3532.16,3536.16," That's not, you know, fighting, but then when that opportunity is there."
3536.16,3537.16, Yeah.
3537.16,3539.16," Do something more than ball, Rory and knock a bunch of people over."
3539.16,3540.16, Right.
3540.16,3544.16," But I mean, at the same time, then people would like have a way to kick us out or they are."
3544.16,3545.16, Promise.
3545.16,3548.16," Well, but must it time when we'd get in there because we're moonlighting and there wouldn't be a mod or something."
3548.16,3550.16, And we'd just be able to like hang out and there would be nothing.
3550.16,3552.16, They could do about it.
3552.16,3554.16, That was so that's what made it seem great.
3554.16,3555.16, That was our house.
3555.16,3556.16, The day.
3556.16,3563.16, So the same person was actually theorizing that in the future at some point that that is what the web itself was going to be.
3563.16,3571.16," The web was eventually going to be, you know, a virtual world kind of, you know, the old way and gets a neuromansor thing where you're actually in."
3571.16,3574.16, That's walking around in the southern world.
3574.16,3576.16, This like home for PlayStation.
3576.16,3579.16," Like like, like, Dave should tell how to skip that pretty much."
3579.16,3580.16, I don't know why that.
3580.16,3582.16, Did you ever see that one?
3582.16,3584.16, It was just like he was in the internet.
3584.16,3593.16, And it was like he's like walking through this busy mall and there's like a million dudes running up in this face like trying to like get him to check out pictures of like Britney Spears is.
3593.16,3596.16, Pooody Tang and stuff like that.
3596.16,3597.16, Right.
3597.16,3599.16, I don't think people want to mess with all that horseshit just to look so bad.
3599.16,3601.16," Yeah, I think that's right."
3601.16,3605.16," Yeah, why would you why would why do you need an avatar like why do you need a simulation of a simulation."
3605.16,3607.16, I got a wrong interact with the simulation.
3607.16,3611.16," I'm going to walk to the library to look up to speak in Pity and I'm like, no, no, thanks."
3611.16,3617.16," Yeah, I'm going to look up the star to go but I'm still waiting for the bus."
3617.16,3619.16, I'm going to get to the wake up P.D.S.I.
3619.16,3622.16," You should have said, fuck, wasn't that on a panel?"
3622.16,3625.16," I, in the future, blackberry down for a minute."
3625.16,3626.16, Yeah.
3626.16,3628.16, What you should have said was.
3628.16,3629.16, Yeah.
3629.16,3632.16, I don't have one of those evil things.
3632.16,3633.16, Yeah.
3633.16,3634.16, Yep.
3634.16,3635.16, You will.
3635.16,3637.16, I don't even know what those people have been using those entire.
3637.16,3638.16," Yes, I have been."
3638.16,3639.16, Yep.
3639.16,3646.16, I saw one on a panel today who was he was using one of those goddamn things sitting on a panel using it while on the panel while on the panel.
3646.16,3647.16, Yeah.
3647.16,3648.16, That's your class.
3648.16,3649.16, Sweet.
3649.16,3650.16, Yep.
3650.16,3652.16, I focused your hair for an hour.
3652.16,3654.16, But the goddamn toy down.
3654.16,3656.16, Salam sand.
3656.16,3657.16, Let you're talking to me for a second.
3657.16,3658.16," No, no."
3658.16,3659.16, Random panky.
3659.16,3660.16, Battery.
3660.16,3661.16," Oh, it's been a battery."
3661.16,3662.16, The pack down.
3662.16,3663.16, Battery.
3663.16,3666.16, The pack felt like a teacher in your student served or playing pic do chat.
3666.16,3667.16, Whatever it is.
3667.16,3670.16, That's going to be tough to be a teacher these days with all that.
3670.16,3671.16, I've all over the gadgets.
3671.16,3672.16, That's so much weird.
3672.16,3673.16, It's a strategy.
3673.16,3677.16," I wouldn't, wouldn't you just have to, I'm happy I like the fact that he tried to just be like up."
3677.16,3678.16," No, I just need, no."
3678.16,3679.16, You can't bring him in.
3679.16,3680.16, Just no cell phone.
3680.16,3681.16, There we go.
3681.16,3682.16, None of that.
3682.16,3683.16," No gameboys, whatever."
3683.16,3684.16, I'd have to be a hard-ass.
3684.16,3690.16," But if you have like the one kid who's mom was like, no, he has to have his cell phone on all the time because just in case there's no emergency."
3690.16,3691.16, Yeah.
3691.16,3692.16, There are parents like that.
3692.16,3693.16, They're going to be one that ruins your house.
3693.16,3695.16," And then like, I can't even have it."
3695.16,3699.16," But I'll keep it in my desk and if I see it flashing, then the kid can have it."
3699.16,3706.16," I just said, I don't know who would teach, like below, you know, below the college level."
3706.16,3709.16," They are, they are brave."
3709.16,3712.16," Now, followers people to do it."
3712.16,3713.16," Yeah, they are."
3713.16,3714.16," No, I'm not kidding."
3714.16,3717.16," They're, they're, they're incredible that they do that."
3717.16,3718.16, I was just reading the story though.
3718.16,3721.16," The other day in the same physical chronicle about, you know, just the shortage of,"
3721.16,3724.16," of teachers for those, for those levels."
3724.16,3727.16," And it's like, it was a teacher writing it."
3727.16,3730.16," It was, you know, it was an op-ed section and it's like, God, do you have a fight ahead of you?"
3730.16,3734.16, You're trying to make a case to get other qualified people to do this position.
3734.16,3739.16," And then, you know, and after all the training and everything too, it's like the, they start off like 35,000."
3739.16,3740.16," Yeah, it's a criminal."
3740.16,3743.16, It's like criminal would teach you to get it paid for what they're doing.
3743.16,3744.16, Yeah.
3744.16,3747.16," It was like my, like, lay mass starting cell."
3747.16,3749.16, I didn't like the game industry.
3749.16,3750.16, Yes.
3750.16,3751.16, Yeah.
3751.16,3755.16," I mean, the fact that we're getting paid more to do this right here now, then teachers, there's a sum."
3755.16,3756.16, That's a lot of odd on that.
3756.16,3758.16," I mean, I'm not given any of my money to them, right?"
3758.16,3759.16," No, first off."
3759.16,3763.16, So money I'm going to use to buy pot.
3763.16,3768.16," For Anthony, do you guys have peripherals too?"
3768.16,3770.16," Well, you better the petting everybody."
3770.16,3771.16, Everything that goes along with.
3771.16,3773.16," No, the truth shop down the street that does that."
3773.16,3774.16," Oh, bad cat."
3774.16,3776.16," Conveniently, look at it."
3777.16,3784.16," Does this do this does it just come in in baked goods or is it like, you know, do they actually have?"
3784.16,3785.16, Absolutely.
3785.16,3787.16," We sell, we make our own big."
3787.16,3788.16, We make our home.
3788.16,3789.16, We have to make our own big.
3789.16,3792.16," Dude, he's going to like help you with last series, man."
3792.16,3793.16, We make our own alcohol.
3793.16,3795.16, I'm not asking because I'm interested.
3795.16,3796.16, We make our own.
3796.16,3797.16, This is an a customer question.
3797.16,3798.16, We make our own.
3798.16,3801.16, All of oil cooked with olive oil.
3801.16,3804.16," The use like olive oil to cook, but it's got a lot of cheese scene."
3804.16,3807.16," We make, uh, and then we also have smokeable stuff."
3807.16,3808.16, It's for dude.
3808.16,3809.16, Everything you can think of.
3809.16,3812.16, Do you have like jerky smoked in?
3812.16,3814.16, Like think about that though.
3814.16,3816.16," It's like, do you go and get aspir, butter?"
3816.16,3819.16," Or like, you get aspirin shampoo."
3819.16,3820.16, You know?
3820.16,3826.16," Honestly, man, if I could get aspirin in a shampoo, I could shampoo my hair and take care of my headache."
3826.16,3827.16, You're plugged in.
3827.16,3828.16," Yeah, I do."
3828.16,3829.16," Yeah, I do."
3829.16,3830.16, Yeah.
3830.16,3831.16, Yeah.
3832.16,3833.16, One take a break.
3833.16,3834.16, One take a break.
3834.16,3835.16, We'll take a break.
3835.16,3838.16, We'll come back with maybe a drug free second half.
3838.16,3839.16," Yeah, right."
3839.16,3840.16, Or not.
3840.16,3841.16, Hmm.
3841.16,3842.16, Yeah.
3842.16,3856.16, And we're back.
3856.16,3857.16, Uh.
3857.16,3858.16, Uh.
3858.16,3860.16, You're never going to not be able to do it.
3860.16,3861.16, I can't do it.
3861.16,3862.16, I can't do it.
3862.16,3863.16, I can't do it.
3863.16,3864.16, I can't do it.
3864.16,3866.16, I can't do it.
3866.16,3867.16, Uh.
3867.16,3869.16," So Sean Maloe, you saw Gothic 4?"
3869.16,3870.16," Yeah, I did."
3870.16,3875.16," They, they, they being dream-catchered slash Joe Wood, brought in."
3875.16,3879.16, We're a early build of Gothic 4.
3879.16,3881.16, It was one of those like so early.
3881.16,3883.16, You kind of wonder why they're bringing it out.
3883.16,3886.16," It was mostly just to show off the,"
3886.16,3890.16," you know, the, the technology and say, look, it's not, not as broken as Gothic 3."
3890.16,3892.16," And you're like, well, it's also really so."
3892.16,3893.16," Wait, who knows?"
3893.16,3895.16," That was, that was their point."
3895.16,3897.16," Basically, look, it's not as broken as well."
3897.16,3898.16, They were there.
3898.16,3901.16," Boy, well, they, they, yeah, they wanted to tell us, hey, we got a new developer."
3901.16,3902.16, And that's quite a demo.
3902.16,3903.16, Yeah.
3903.16,3905.16," It was, it was, it was so early."
3905.16,3913.16," You just like, okay, well, I, I don't know what to say about this because it's basically a guy running around with a sore, but not really able to fight because the,"
3913.16,3915.16," you know, hey, hey, guys, not ready yet."
3915.16,3919.16," You're like, okay, that looks like a pretty good world, but reason I wanted to bring it up."
3919.16,3920.16," Yes, sir."
3920.16,3921.16, Because they have a new developer.
3921.16,3922.16, It's not pronobites anymore.
3922.16,3924.16, It's been doing the Gothic series for a while.
3924.16,3931.16," They, we should remember the name, but it was some other developer because, like, I felt pronobites just screwed it up so bad."
3931.16,3933.16, But didn't pronobites create the whole.
3933.16,3934.16," Yes, they did."
3934.16,3936.16," And so they've just passed it off to someone else, right?"
3936.16,3939.16," I think, you know, like the Gothic fan community and Germany."
3939.16,3940.16," Wait, right?"
3940.16,3941.16, Yeah.
3942.16,3951.16, And they made a great job with the legend because that was way better than any of the course.
3951.16,3954.16," Of course on a roll, though, they had a great, great ninja game."
3954.16,3955.16, Plus good.
3955.16,3956.16, Anyways.
3956.16,3958.16," They had herty, girdy."
3958.16,3962.16," Didn't they also make what was that ridiculous, like fighting force?"
3962.16,3963.16, Yeah.
3963.16,3965.16," Yeah, that was fun."
3965.16,3970.16," So anyway, new developer, it was way to really discern whether that's a good thing or a bad thing."
3970.16,3973.16," Yeah, and this, you know, six months in development, tech demo."
3973.16,3979.16," But because they were trying to, they're trying to cater to, you know, obviously a hardcore PC German audience."
3979.16,3980.16, Right.
3980.16,3982.16, And trying to sell this thing in America.
3982.16,3983.16, What are you doing?
3983.16,3984.16, So what?
3984.16,3985.16, Yeah.
3985.16,3986.16, Yeah.
3986.16,3988.16," It's like some, it's a USB-B angle."
3988.16,3990.16, It's a USB-Cock ring.
3990.16,3992.16, It is.
3992.16,3994.16," So, sorry, go."
3994.16,3995.16, It's okay.
3995.16,3999.16," So they're so concerned about, you know, America and Europe, that there is a"
3999.16,4001.16, toggle in the options menu.
4001.16,4003.16, I don't know how they're going to present it.
4003.16,4006.16," If they're going to present it this way later, later in the game's life."
4006.16,4011.16, But there's a toggle for an American check or European check color palette.
4011.16,4012.16, Really?
4012.16,4016.16, Which was the strangest one of the strangest things I've ever seen in the demo.
4016.16,4017.16," I was like, really?"
4017.16,4018.16, European color palette.
4018.16,4022.16," And really, yeah, Europeans like they showing that they have a, and more, they, they specifically mentioned it."
4022.16,4024.16, And I was just taking it back by it.
4024.16,4026.16," And like they're, and down to that level."
4026.16,4027.16, I don't know.
4028.16,4029.16, I don't know.
4029.16,4033.16," So that's like something internally like maybe the, when they read the US version, you'll get the US color."
4033.16,4034.16," Oh, I see."
4034.16,4035.16," Which is right, or it's alright."
4035.16,4036.16, Which is right.
4036.16,4038.16," So if I experiment and has, you know, glow effects and more lens flurry kind of stuff."
4038.16,4040.16," And then the European color palette is like,"
4040.16,4044.16," DRAB and realistic and, you know, earthy or tones star-card."
4044.16,4045.16, I just like.
4045.16,4047.16, Wow.
4047.16,4050.16," And they would just mean, you know, I was making a,"
4050.16,4055.16," Point being, hey, we understand that Europeans want something different from Americans."
4055.16,4056.16, And I'm like the color palette.
4056.16,4059.7, the color panel is really just the equivalent of like the marketing
4059.7,4062.3399999999997, door telling us we need to use more yellow on our coverage.
4063.3399999999997,4066.5, But it's even not it is. It's all too because that gave us so
4066.5,4070.06, already bought it at that point for their European audience in the first
4070.06,4073.98, place. Right. And that they I mean is it more like it's just it's so
4073.98,4076.7, weird that like this this is what's going to do it if those if those
4076.7,4081.12, North Americans know that they can get some more. The greens are greener
4081.12,4085.72, white so lighter. But it's the same game engine. No it's different
4085.72,4089.0, game engine. Oh yeah kind of tore up. No I mean it's the same game
4089.0,4093.12, yeah between between the European and American color pal. It's just yeah
4093.12,4097.68, the different is between Gothic. Yeah. Yeah. That's bizarre. It's kind of
4097.68,4100.76, just like this. It's one of the weirdest options I've ever seen in the
4100.76,4104.72, menu before. Kind of fits in with with stocker which I mean if you look at
4104.72,4109.92, the palette on that. It means as dreary as you can imagine rightfully so I mean
4109.92,4114.88, it was basically just a recreation of the exclusion zone around turno
4114.88,4118.96, wounds. It's definitely a Pripyat. It they brought that mentioned that they
4118.96,4124.36, brought a clear sky in and it's under embargo and for like another week or so.
4124.36,4128.52, But one thing I can say though because it's not necessarily about the game
4128.52,4133.24, but just more about the studio is that you know as I asked the the guy from
4133.24,4139.4, GSC game world the developer. If stocker ended up the way it was sort of
4139.4,4145.0, just because it couldn't help but be that way and that way is that it didn't
4145.0,4149.679999999999, really hold your hand you know and it didn't have and it did if you wanted to
4149.679999999999,4152.76, find out where to go you'd have to pull up a map and look on the map and find
4152.76,4156.92, out where you know it wasn't telling you good job you did you did something you
4156.92,4159.599999999999, know you get an achievement point forward or this is exactly what you're
4159.6,4163.400000000001, supposed to do and but and also you know other things I mentioned it would have
4163.400000000001,4167.320000000001, areas where things would be happening and they would have put a great you know
4167.320000000001,4170.88, an enormous amount of effort the building needs really nice looking sections
4170.88,4173.160000000001, but then they weren't like set pieces or anything they were just there
4173.160000000001,4177.200000000001, sometimes maybe there would just be one loner and them and it was such a unique
4177.200000000001,4181.08, way of designing a game and it really reminds me of like you know PC game
4181.08,4185.52, design back when in North America when it gaming wasn't for everyone in the
4185.52,4190.160000000001, world so what he said is that there's like oh of course this was deliberate
4190.160000000001,4195.120000000001, it is like you know you cranny and gamers and and German gamers and the
4195.120000000001,4199.8, people who we made this for are absolutely hardcore and it's like if you if you
4199.8,4203.160000000001, can build a computer and Ukraine or whatever it's gonna play this game you
4203.160000000001,4208.96, can certainly don't need us to tell you when you start the game that looking
4208.96,4212.52, moving the mouse up makes you look up and moving it down makes it down and then
4212.52,4215.160000000001, here's a train for you to crouch under to prove that you're capable of
4215.160000000001,4220.120000000001, hating sea or shifter whatever the case may be the whole game was definitely
4220.120000000001,4223.84, that way and then even you know there's even more interesting to hear him say
4223.84,4227.84, that like yeah we we had to fight the publisher you know they had to fight THQ
4227.84,4232.240000000001, and a lot of things because in you understand it's maybe this is not a right
4232.240000000001,4236.4400000000005, or a wrong here it's just for you know taste it for the style of game you
4236.4400000000005,4240.400000000001, want to make but because again it was like so weird like that this game came
4240.4,4245.639999999999, out here in America you know yeah being the way it is it just seems like
4245.639999999999,4248.32, a risk so I mean it was interesting to hear that and of course with you know
4248.32,4251.92, so for a clear sky just basically the same you know way of doing things
4251.92,4256.2, like yeah we're not gonna this is for hardcore gamers and other interesting
4256.2,4261.36, thing about them is that they they didn't make that much money I mean well
4261.36,4266.04, the game was profitable I heard the game was profitable so for the publisher but
4266.04,4270.88, it was largely because of the the people who made it aren't you know they're
4270.88,4274.72, not making giant salaries they despite the fact that they've been working on
4274.72,4279.36, it doing R&D on it for like six years it was still easy to make it profit on
4279.36,4282.44, publishing that game because they they made so little now they're happy that
4282.44,4288.16, they're making more but that's something interesting too so is that this
4288.16,4291.72, this reminded me of them in in the current issue of edge or maybe it's not
4291.72,4296.280000000001, current I don't know we we we have a delay when magazines from UK to
4296.280000000001,4300.400000000001, right over here what's on the metal gear sold for an edge edges a magazine
4300.400000000001,4305.68, published in a nighted kingdom really really small circulation and it and very
4305.68,4310.12, strong you know industry focus and there there's just a fantastic column in the
4310.12,4314.08, back of the issue by Asheter brought it down with me I'm not gonna have his name
4314.08,4319.320000000001, but he's someone who works at EALA in the head of guest column and the whole
4319.32,4325.48, you know thrust of his discussion is that you know used to be in PC games and
4325.48,4329.679999999999, just gaming in general you have something like an an old-um or something and you
4329.679999999999,4332.799999999999, wouldn't know exactly what's gonna happen if you walk through this marsh if
4332.799999999999,4336.12, you're in up to get leg rot your legs are gonna fall off you wouldn't know if
4336.12,4340.48, every action is good or bad and what it did to you on on a on a definite scale
4340.48,4345.599999999999, a great scale of you know absolute evil and you know total
4345.6,4350.360000000001, ethical behavior or something you wouldn't even know I mean you just have to
4350.360000000001,4354.4400000000005, figure things out and that was part of the fun you know seeing you know just
4354.4400000000005,4357.4400000000005, who do you align with where do you go for the missions and stuff and then as
4357.4400000000005,4363.64, opposed to now I mean we design games we I mean him you know an exact opposite
4363.64,4367.320000000001, fashion and that's of course you know all inclusivity everyone's got to be
4367.320000000001,4371.76, able to do it but you also need to remind people over and over again that
4371.76,4377.64, they're doing good you have to tell them you know like this is what you
4377.64,4381.4800000000005, were supposed to do like hooray you you found the gold bar something and then
4381.4800000000005,4384.320000000001, on top of that he didn't bring this up but I just reminded me there's this
4384.320000000001,4387.84, additional layer with the achievement points where it's like and even you know
4387.84,4391.68, another extent of telling people like yes you're doing good you're doing okay
4391.68,4394.88, this is the right thing you're going the right way and then and we talked about
4394.88,4398.320000000001, it before you know with with games like perfect dark literally have illuminated
4398.32,4401.719999999999, arrows on the floor telling you where to go and and he was just you know
4401.719999999999,4405.04, saying like it I mean what are we losing if this is the only way to make
4405.04,4409.48, games you know and made a case for what does it tell you about the world when
4409.48,4413.44, you play old man and he made you know he put together this is really excellent
4413.44,4417.719999999999, you know summary of the what he took from it is about you know about trusting
4417.719999999999,4421.24, and figuring things out and stuff and and as opposed to what are the
4421.24,4424.12, games that they're making now telling you and it's basically that like if you
4424.12,4428.28, do everything we tell you to we'll give you a pat on the back every time you
4428.28,4431.8, have done something we tell you to you know and always every always know
4431.8,4434.36, that we're here to watch another thing remind me of two I'm thinking of
4434.36,4438.44, it's like especially achievement points it's kind of like when you know you're
4438.44,4440.88, at the swimming pool and you're like look mom look mom because you're
4440.88,4443.44, gonna like die for jumping or something you absolutely have to have someone
4443.44,4446.96, watching achievements is just that mom that everyone wants there to like look
4446.96,4452.04, I really did hit the sky with six grenades like I really did find you know
4452.04,4455.4, 15 gold bars and battlefield bed companies here you go here you're a
4455.4,4463.2, team in yeah yeah yeah so I mean I guess you'll get asked them like if we're
4463.2,4466.04, all in the same page I mean what are our attitudes toward that sort of thing
4466.04,4471.679999999999, yeah I think I I think that's very true that that we're all like a lot more
4471.679999999999,4478.0, coddled now right and and that we we seem to need it and the funny because
4478.0,4481.599999999999, I was just joking about this with my daughter when she and I were playing
4481.6,4488.400000000001, boom blocks a few days ago on the Wii and you know if you you can get a
4488.400000000001,4494.0, gold silver or bronze metal on on all the the different puzzles and you know
4494.0,4497.8, you can do these levels over to try to get a better score or whatever but you
4497.8,4501.160000000001, know if you don't get even the bronze you know if you just kind of blow
4501.160000000001,4504.76, the thing I was playing with her and that's what happened like basically I was
4504.76,4508.84, gonna win nothing and the thing comes up and it says great job and it's like
4508.84,4513.8, no it wasn't I was a shit job like why did the game tell me that and I
4513.8,4517.28, mean I talked about it with her only 14 it was like man you know they just can't
4517.28,4521.28, let you feel like you you know it should really say you loser it should say
4521.28,4525.360000000001, something like that right I mean that's what an old game it is a game over and
4525.360000000001,4530.56, take it at the title screen to this more you know and certainly there are plenty
4530.56,4535.56, of PC games or from not just PC games consequence to where yeah you make one
4535.56,4538.84, wrong move and it's just game over and you're dead you know and then you
4538.84,4542.64, had to figure out okay I guess I shouldn't have done that certainly tutorials
4542.64,4548.04, or another thing I mean when I when I replayed follow a few months ago that was
4548.04,4554.320000000001, the thing I that most struck me in the opening game which was that you create
4554.320000000001,4559.88, your character and they put you in the world and good luck you know you you got to
4559.88,4563.080000000001, figure out this game now and it's hard right from the start I mean all you're
4563.08,4566.8, doing is killing rats but if you got to figure out how to kill the rat you
4566.8,4571.0, know they don't like now you're gonna press this sorry I was about to say
4571.0,4576.36, you're out that it is a rat this totally reminded me of we were on Ryan and I
4576.36,4580.48, ran Wretchen at the other day we were discussing old Indian or Jones games
4580.48,4584.16, one of the first ones was Raiders of the Lost Ark on the Atari Atari 2600
4584.16,4588.64, which was made by the same day made the E.T. version if you played I mean I
4588.64,4592.68, really like the Raiders game for the so-to-die yeah and it was you know I
4592.68,4597.12, was much younger so my I don't my head space is a little different but at the
4597.12,4603.76, time it was absolutely incomprehensible right that kind of was the challenge was
4603.76,4607.84, to figure out because it had a what this all this abstraction meant and
4607.84,4610.4800000000005, trying to put it together and then when you finally got the arc you're like wow I
4610.4800000000005,4615.72, figured out this like intensely bizarre cryptic puzzle that this is entirely
4615.72,4621.4800000000005, non-verbal form of reasoning that you've that you had to have mastered but
4621.4800000000005,4624.76, there's never any direct articulation of what it is that you were doing it's
4624.76,4627.68, like you just did you know like sometimes you're working on a project or you're
4627.68,4630.8, trying to fix a computer I'm sure we've all got some example and you end up
4630.8,4635.4400000000005, doing it but you're at a entire loss for words of like how you did or what
4635.4400000000005,4639.8, yeah what led you to do one you know right one thing after another and I mean
4639.8,4642.8, it's like that when I play those games too you know like superman was the
4642.8,4645.64, same way it's like there's bridge parts like what's what am I doing what's
4645.64,4650.200000000001, going on in and in the rear-seller-star care you know there is the level of
4650.200000000001,4654.160000000001, course of what anything even represented on the screen is that a snake is at a
4654.160000000001,4657.8, whip right that and then but then when you do figure out what things are
4657.8,4661.88, supposed to represent it's still the logic of what they're doing there it wasn't
4661.88,4665.6, it was really weird I mean it's like that game is almost like an IQ test or
4665.6,4672.400000000001, something you know yeah some hot way same with ET yeah except ET wasn't fun I mean
4672.400000000001,4675.200000000001, it was basically falling in the halls over and over but it still had the
4675.2,4679.5599999999995, element of abstraction yeah you get out of the halls yeah it would never pop
4679.5599999999995,4684.16, and it's funny because now in games where it's so self-explanatory because
4684.16,4687.639999999999, of the fidelity of the graphics and everything that like maybe there's a close
4687.639999999999,4691.12, door in front of you open the door and it will tell you to open the door by
4691.12,4697.24, pressing his button but ET was never like that's an alien and he's in a pit you
4697.24,4700.639999999999, can levitate out of the pit by pressing this button it would be like there's a
4700.639999999999,4704.16, block and this is a black space and he seems to wiggle around when that wiggle
4704.16,4708.4, the stick you know oh I mean nothing that was also a strike and if even if
4708.4,4711.48, he was far back as metal football like nothing's more abstract than that yeah
4711.48,4716.5199999999995, just dots on a glowing field but I think you know all games through the years you
4716.5199999999995,4721.12, know you go back to side scrollers that's you don't have any any less control over
4721.12,4723.84, your destiny in a side scroller you just go right kill the enemies you go
4723.84,4727.24, right but then some games occasionally have a door and you can go in a door
4727.24,4729.76, and you know you might you know like Bonnie Commander or something like
4729.76,4731.76, that you want a door and you might see something you would read some
4731.76,4735.280000000001, text you didn't read and I think games like that there's games like the two now
4735.280000000001,4738.320000000001, that they're essentially still a side scroller you're going down a corridor
4738.320000000001,4740.400000000001, you're shooting enemies and doing what they want you to do what other games
4740.400000000001,4745.320000000001, you know might have some more doors to go off an explorer I don't know and if
4745.320000000001,4748.12, you look at games like bioshock that came actually made fun of the whole
4748.12,4751.84, kind of hold your hand like you're doing what we expect to do through the whole
4751.84,4756.12, game with the whole like which you kindly think right joke about that was the
4756.12,4760.92, intro can the game the catch yes yeah I mean a lot of people hate these games but
4760.92,4766.64, even like ribbon and mist to another extent are all in that category where you're
4766.64,4769.76, just kind of dumped into this world and they're like okay you walk over there
4769.76,4773.08, there's a bird up there maybe that means something you know there's seven
4773.08,4779.16, levers is a dial and this thing's flashing green yeah go and yeah and to me
4779.16,4784.0, people hate it but at the time I love that I love trying to just I love those
4784.0,4788.4400000000005, things but I thought those first two misgames but they were really fucking hard
4788.44,4792.639999999999, right they really were I don't you know people are talking about it now as being
4792.639999999999,4797.28, hard more sort of like you know the kind of thing that led to the like horrendous
4797.28,4803.0, pile of shit of you know CD adventure games that that that big hat you know
4803.0,4807.879999999999, but those original games were incredibly hard I mean especially to me it was
4807.879999999999,4812.759999999999, like you pull the lever on the crank and it like it turns something on the
4812.759999999999,4816.32, other side of the island like you couldn't even see the result of what it did
4816.32,4820.36, like well okay I guess I did something right and a modern mist would go there
4820.36,4823.759999999999, to have like the voice in your wrist watch go exactly check out the other side of
4823.759999999999,4828.639999999999, the island totally it's the exact right yeah you see the thing move yeah
4828.639999999999,4832.4, yeah yeah to remember like yeah thank you next time you were there right
4832.4,4836.36, side of the island that oh this rock is a total on the opposite of the screen
4836.36,4837.88, now what did well well what what what what what what what what what what what what
4837.88,4840.5599999999995, what did that happen there you do have to get a cute little side kick going you
4840.5599999999995,4844.24, know yeah I think it should check out the other side of the island now maybe this
4844.24,4848.92, means something yeah stuff like like just games being like just more difficult
4848.92,4852.38, in a sense that enemies kill you faster harder to kill like I mean I'm not
4852.38,4857.08, gonna defend that but the difference would be like in just I mean when it was
4857.08,4860.599999999999, good enough to say like let's and this is what what was cool about stalker you
4860.599999999999,4865.44, know is like let's just being in this world and fighting for your life and
4865.44,4868.96, figuring out what's happening to this world or why it is the way it is and what
4868.96,4873.679999999999, you need to do that next should be interesting enough to keep you going but then
4873.68,4877.0, with like I don't want to just pick on a a because everyone does it but but
4877.0,4880.84, a a you could tell that it's become some internally mandated you know like
4880.84,4887.240000000001, design principle for all their studios that you have to take and try to to let
4887.240000000001,4891.240000000001, people know oh this is where you're having fun instead of just counting on it to
4891.240000000001,4894.68, be fun in the first place I don't want to say this for like I mean I haven't
4894.68,4897.280000000001, played sport I don't know it's not but I'm thinking about a lot of shooters
4897.280000000001,4902.0, you know so for metal of honor airborne for example you'd say hey a lot it's
4902.0,4906.16, gonna be exciting for people to jump out of a C47 pulp a rip cord and then
4906.16,4909.32, parachute somewhere in the middle of a firefight but then they got to go no we
4909.32,4913.24, got to let people know that this is a game and make it fun so then we're gonna
4913.24,4916.76, have five highlighted areas and you get bonus points if you land on them and
4916.76,4920.0, if you land on them a metal will appear on the screen and tell you great job
4920.0,4925.52, um one of the elements and you know that company of course is that as you're
4925.52,4929.04, going through the buffet you're supposed to go and find you know find gold bars
4929.04,4933.92, everywhere and so it's like surviving the battle I don't know some people
4933.92,4936.68, like that but we got to like really make it fun and we'll put a big
4936.68,4941.16, color A you found the gold bar or you know and then like again I mean it just
4941.16,4946.64, means it's a good note and it just you know and then even in airborne again there's
4946.64,4949.72, the whole thing where if you get enough headshots you know then then you unlock
4949.72,4952.72, something and it pauses the game and throws the big thing on there and it's like
4952.72,4957.6, I see I guess and clearly they wouldn't be doing that if it didn't work so for
4957.6,4962.240000000001, I would say that for majority people they're playing the games that must really
4962.240000000001,4966.400000000001, be really important for them. Yes because you got people like us who have
4966.400000000001,4970.92, been gaming forever and we're kind of weaned and enjoyed and kept playing
4970.92,4976.76, these really non-hand holding games but now there's so many more gamers
4976.76,4981.76, theoretically. Well I know obviously something did that make to make
4981.76,4985.200000000001, they ought to in so much bigger and maybe it is. And what you look at like
4985.2,4989.24, why you know world of workcraft why that's so popular achievement points I mean
4989.24,4992.5199999999995, all these things that like people are always talking about it's like it seems
4992.5199999999995,4996.4, like they're all some variation on that right we did make this point about
4996.4,5000.32, ever because earlier and we've made this point on this podcast before but it
5000.32,5005.88, definitely speaks to the same argument here that while became that that kind of
5005.88,5010.28, hand holding version of of the MMO you know wow became the one where like the
5010.28,5014.12, second you log in right and funny you there's a doubt dude with a yellow
5014.12,5018.16, exhalation point staring right at you you immediately have something to do
5018.16,5022.32, I mean in the old MMO world you created your character and you were in that
5022.32,5025.16, world and good luck to you to figure out what the fuck you're supposed to do
5025.16,5029.599999999999, in there and there might be quests but there might not be you know or and if the
5029.599999999999,5033.08, guy has a quest you're not gonna notice by looking at him you have to go through
5033.08,5038.04, some arcane dialogue and then eventually he might say something the gameplay was
5038.04,5043.72, for you to figure out and you know I think maybe a lot of it was because
5043.72,5049.320000000001, the gamers and developers and the gamers and essentially we were all the
5049.320000000001,5053.04, same we were all the same audience of people right we were like they were
5053.04,5057.52, making them for us but we you know the demographic was much smaller I think in
5057.52,5061.6, terms of the type of people who are playing these games and we all agreed upon
5061.6,5065.2, this kind of accepted language and this accepted gameplay were all sort of
5065.2,5068.76, like signing the same contract that this is the kind of experience we're gonna
5068.76,5073.4400000000005, have and it's gonna be this level of difficulty it comes down to the sales
5073.44,5076.12, too I mean so if you're gonna invest that much money to make a game nowadays
5076.12,5079.839999999999, you have to be reasonably certain that you're going to have so many people
5079.839999999999,5083.04, buy the game and a lot of people buy the game because they're reasonably
5083.04,5086.879999999999, certain that they're not gonna be stuck and unable to figure out what to do
5086.879999999999,5090.839999999999, next but so it is different I mean I was as you're talking I was also thinking
5090.839999999999,5094.879999999999, back of like you know in addition to like the big you know sea change in MMO
5094.879999999999,5099.32, design but games like that are often listed among people's all-time favorites
5099.32,5103.48, like out of this world and flashback and then even games that aren't on
5103.48,5107.36, anyone's favorite list but like the Kingsfield series of first-person
5107.36,5112.24, sort of like RPGs on PST I remember playing those all the way to the end and
5112.24,5115.88, the thing about all those games is that they were entirely non-verbal like no one
5115.88,5119.48, would talk to you or tell you anything at least in any recognizable language and
5119.48,5122.84, then if they would it would be just strictly the characters and there would
5122.84,5127.88, never be anything breaking that that wall and saying like a good job this is
5127.88,5131.36, where you should go next and then half the time what would happen is as a
5131.36,5134.92, plate and the further and further you got along you would look back on all this
5134.92,5138.36, just this memory would be the only way to process everything you've done in a
5138.36,5142.04, series of you know actions that you perform and you look at I don't know it would
5142.04,5145.64, be just really immersive I feel like shit how I'm all the way here now this
5145.64,5149.08, is a crazy place like it and same thing with you know as you get through
5149.08,5153.4800000000005, some of the levels and out of this world you're like what just happened but
5153.4800000000005,5156.04, then you figured out you're like oh I think this happened and it's kind of cool
5156.04,5160.12, actually stopping think about what went on for a moment in the game others and
5160.12,5164.96, well you got the gold bar that's what happened you need to go get 16 more of them
5164.96,5171.72, I don't want to sound like two not be either like you know I was better back
5171.72,5176.88, in the day when you need more ETs yeah I mean cuz like we also said like I
5176.88,5180.84, wouldn't I agree with Ryan I wouldn't want to go back to the ever-quest days like
5180.84,5184.24, yeah you did have to figure it out and yeah that was our best
5184.24,5188.48, goal that has been in that but it's something like like I think ever-quest one is
5188.48,5193.0, bad game design and it's like that that genre just hadn't matured to the point
5193.0,5196.28, where it was right it wasn't that they decided they were gonna get to my
5196.28,5199.28, I think they I think they accidentally stumbled upon something intriguing
5199.28,5203.28, within that bad game design though I think they were and then you look at like
5203.28,5208.679999999999, point of comparison the game like the old NES Ninja Guide End games you know
5208.68,5215.200000000001, those those were good games they were really hard but not like a stupid Xbox one
5215.200000000001,5220.4800000000005, it's definitely not like I mean and I agree with the right or the
5220.4800000000005,5224.64, column and then it's like it's not either or right and it's certainly like both
5224.64,5229.4400000000005, but I mean because we can take granted that we're going to have the accessible
5229.4400000000005,5232.8, games that are patting you on the back every time you do something that they tell
5232.8,5237.320000000001, you to do it's more for I think it's okay to get nostalgic about the other
5237.32,5241.5199999999995, type because it is a dying breed and there are relatively you know a few of
5241.5199999999995,5245.2, of them I definitely felt I feel like I reacted to a blibbing that way and that's
5245.2,5248.679999999999, one reason why I like that game so much among you know there's all that the
5248.679999999999,5252.28, people that like that game suck but I mean I definitely felt that from that game
5252.28,5257.92, and so I mean there's still there you know and again even even in its design
5257.92,5261.679999999999, like portal I mean of course there's stuff to help you through and you have a
5261.679999999999,5265.96, narrator albeit an unreliable one helping you through but it was still closer to
5265.96,5271.32, that than and it's playing within I mean that's part of part of the what's
5271.32,5273.6, going on here I'm trying to talk about it I'm sorry I mean there's like I
5273.6,5276.4, deserve another show coming up there's like people standing outside though
5276.4,5283.0, okay all right okay but finish your point please remember well that's part
5283.0,5285.88, of the point of that game right I mean does this cake is a lie thing I mean
5285.88,5289.36, if you look if the cake is the the word notice you get on the screen for the
5289.36,5292.4, gold bar and you're playing that whole game for that and you never get that
5292.4,5298.04, the game without without that popping up and then that's a good thing right but
5298.04,5302.32, that was also that game was also good and that it didn't like I thought that
5302.32,5307.5599999999995, game was rewarding in that I mean you really were rewarded for thinking through
5307.5599999999995,5311.599999999999, they did not hold your hand through the puzzle solving and that came you know
5311.599999999999,5316.08, that they did but in a what they did they did in a really streamlining and
5316.08,5321.08, inconspicuous way and that was just that by the degree of difficulty with each
5321.08,5324.76, puzzle in the way that they ordered them they were giving you the tools even
5324.76,5327.88, though they're not telling you now remember what you did in this level but
5327.88,5332.48, yes you're gonna need to insert a version of that maneuver in one six levels
5332.48,5335.84, from now but they they you know not verbally they taught you how to do all that
5335.84,5339.72, and so they were coaching you but it was just again but that's different that's
5339.72,5342.96, different than the flashing arrow coming up on the screen yeah that's everything
5342.96,5347.28, that we're talking about here yeah I mean that's like every that has like
5347.28,5349.8, everything to do with like even you know games shouldn't it's not the point
5349.8,5352.400000000001, that a game should be opaque I mean that's bad too I mean some of those
5352.400000000001,5355.28, games canceling you too there would be certain things you would need to do
5355.28,5358.72, that no one could ever make you ever talk about them you know that's like by the
5358.72,5362.04, leg to get the tornado it's like figuring out some lost you know is a
5362.04,5367.8, quiddler to figuring out what's up with lost and but it's like it's in between
5367.8,5372.24, there in between being like entirely ridiculous and you know unsauvable and
5372.24,5376.24, then being so easy and that you're feeding someone the answers over and over again
5376.24,5380.679999999999, and then telling them good job for receiving the answers passively from
5380.679999999999,5384.24, or boom blocks good job when you've just failed you know
5384.24,5389.48, amity the opposite of a good job it's sarcastic yeah good job Jeff yeah that's
5389.48,5392.28, like the video game version of like colorically challenged or something you
5392.28,5399.599999999999, know yeah so we're not dumb that's the point don't you like we're dumb right
5399.599999999999,5403.599999999999, except for the dumb's up with it and treat them like they're dumb but
5403.6,5407.04, the games for the people who aren't dumb it's a game and they get dumb
5407.04,5411.88, series for dumb people if any developers are listening I'm sure that they're
5411.88,5416.4400000000005, like well you haven't participated in beta test or you haven't brought in a
5416.4400000000005,5421.360000000001, focus group and let them play your game and watch all of 99% of them get stuck on
5421.360000000001,5424.120000000001, what we thought would be the most self-evident even a little thing like
5424.120000000001,5428.160000000001, stance and you know like bio-shocks option and then menu to turn off flashing
5428.160000000001,5431.400000000001, objects like little things like yeah those with difference those are fantastic
5431.4,5434.96, okay well so we need to not forget about that yeah because it was like just not
5434.96,5440.24, one game like that seriously that that was an excellent flashing objects
5440.24,5444.04, hints all that just letting people tailor that end of the experience to their
5444.04,5448.0, own in a in a dish instead of just if you're killed in one shot so if you're
5448.0,5451.5199999999995, killed in two shots right okay we're getting the ulcer but I do want to say
5451.5199999999995,5455.36, to developers we know some developers as one of the show and I'd be
5455.36,5459.48, interested in hearing examples of like gameplay elements that you had that you
5459.48,5463.919999999999, that were tested like Sean's talking about that ended up being like your
5463.919999999999,5467.28, audience was too stupid and you had to take them out like if you have any good
5467.28,5470.08, examples of that kind of thing where you thought there was something fine but
5470.08,5473.959999999999, but the gamers were not smart enough for your game right as in and tells could
5473.959999999999,5477.759999999999, be be from epic said you know when I talked to them for the gears of our PC
5477.759999999999,5480.959999999999, cover story he was like dude people are stupid you know because what I was
5480.959999999999,5486.0, asking about the the with the white button was a solve puzzle button right
5486.0,5490.8, right about you know less obvious ways to handle that and his response is
5490.8,5495.64, people are pretty stupid there you go okay and that's some out of the
5495.64,5500.36, quick show and we'll see you next week
