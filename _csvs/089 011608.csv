10.0,19.0," January 15th, 2008, one of those heinous deadline days, but we're podcasting anyway because we have the love for you."
19.0,23.0," Hi guys, hi Jeff."
23.0,24.0, Hi.
24.0,25.0, Hi.
25.0,26.0, Hi.
26.0,27.0, Hi.
27.0,29.0, This is Ryan Scott.
29.0,32.0, This is Robert Ashley.
32.0,35.0," Okay, Bobito, Max Chill."
35.0,38.0, This is Sean.
38.0,40.0, This is also Sean.
40.0,42.0," Wow, I feel so chilled today."
42.0,43.0, We need to out the energy level.
43.0,44.0, Two names.
44.0,47.0," Yeah, you know, we were talking, Sean and I were talking yesterday."
47.0,50.0, The only one who has a nickname here.
50.0,53.0, I was noticing online in various internet forums.
53.0,57.0," I thought, all sorts of one podcast people have these like nicknames."
57.0,60.0, I don't know where the fuck they came from or what they mean.
60.0,63.0, But they got them and we don't.
63.0,64.0, And that upset me a little.
64.0,66.0, I feel like we should have nicknames at this point.
66.0,67.0, I wouldn't be invious.
67.0,68.0, I've always had names.
68.0,73.0," It's like from having a name like Robert, people have to name you something different because"
73.0,74.0, your name is a fucking boring.
74.0,75.0, Uh-huh.
75.0,76.0, You know?
76.0,79.0, So I've always had Jeff Green isn't that exotic of a name.
79.0,82.0," Yeah, but it's not Bob."
83.0,85.0," You know, I don't buy the excuse."
85.0,86.0, They're two shons.
86.0,88.0," Yeah, that's true."
88.0,90.0, That's that's the perfect setup for the right thing right there.
90.0,93.0, So I propose we make up our own nicknames.
93.0,96.0, Since the internet forums aren't supplying them with us.
96.0,99.0, I don't have any childhood nicknames.
99.0,101.0," That we could well, we've done this."
101.0,102.0, There's no nicknames.
102.0,106.0," Yeah, but they were all kind of riffs off like my last name and being skin."
106.0,108.0, So it's like green being string bean.
108.0,110.0," You know, which I think."
110.0,112.0," Yeah, that's pretty good green being."
112.0,113.0, Yeah.
113.0,116.0, I recall you guys branding me with a handful of names when I started here.
116.0,117.0, We did.
117.0,118.0, What was the nicknames we gave you?
118.0,120.0, Can Brown use to call me animal.
120.0,121.0," Oh, animal."
121.0,122.0," Oh, that's right."
122.0,123.0," Oh, that's right."
123.0,124.0, Forget about that.
124.0,125.0, Right.
125.0,127.0, It was one of those ironic names.
127.0,128.0, Right.
128.0,129.0, Yeah.
129.0,132.0, I don't believe you.
132.0,134.0, I forget who came up with Rye Dog.
134.0,137.0," Yeah, you do have a thought like the copy desk."
137.0,139.0, I think that's like stuck through like my online.
139.0,142.0, Like my steam IT has Rye Dog.
142.0,146.0, So I'm going to go with black dragon.
146.0,147.0, Wow.
147.0,148.0, Yeah.
148.0,149.0, Just co-op black dragon.
149.0,150.0, Yeah.
150.0,151.0," Oh, man."
151.0,154.0, Did you hear black dragon on GFW today?
154.0,155.0, He rocked.
155.0,157.0, Not on call me that really.
157.0,158.0, It's too light.
158.0,159.0, It's too light.
159.0,160.0, It's too light.
160.0,162.0, You're absolutely screwed.
162.0,167.0, You have you have the name of a lead singer of a like a Norwegian metal band now.
167.0,169.0," I actually, I stole that from it."
169.0,170.0, It was an ugly Betty line.
170.0,171.0, Okay.
171.0,172.0, Thank you for themselves.
172.0,173.0, Code names on me.
173.0,174.0, You watch ugly Betty.

175.0,176.0, I've I've confessed.
176.0,177.0, Leave.
177.0,179.0, We've covered this lovely Betty on Jeff Debbie before.
179.0,181.0," Oh, it must be like the, they do like an American version now."
181.0,182.0, Red or name version.
182.0,183.0, Right.
183.0,185.0, He watches Gilmore girls too.
185.0,186.0, I did.
186.0,187.0, It's over now.
187.0,188.0, Okay.
188.0,189.0, Hi.
189.0,190.0, Welcome to last year.
190.0,192.0," Oh, and well."
192.0,194.0, How are you Robert Ashley?
194.0,195.0, I'm pretty good.
195.0,196.0, I'm happy new year.
196.0,197.0," Oh, well, thank you."
197.0,199.0, It's been a while since you've been with us.
199.0,200.0, Yeah.
200.0,203.0, I was out of town for a long time when it's Texas.
203.0,207.0, And then suffered heinous game related back problems.
207.0,208.0, Game related?
208.0,209.0, Yeah.
209.0,211.0," No, like a message to all the hardcore gamers out there."
211.0,215.0, You may think that you could sit in a chair for like 14 hours a day.
215.0,216.0, But you can't.
216.0,217.0, You can.
217.0,219.0, It's going to happen sooner or later.
219.0,221.0, You're going to break something.
221.0,223.0, Did you really yearn to yourself doing it?
223.0,225.0," It was like a combination of like,"
225.0,228.0, some sitting down for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours.
228.0,233.0, And then getting up every couple of days and doing like extrine US exercise without stretching.
233.0,235.0, So I like popped a disk.
235.0,236.0, It's disgusting.
236.0,237.0, And it kind of.
237.0,240.0," Well, so obviously the lesson here is don't exercise."
240.0,242.0," Yeah, actually, maybe that's what it is."
242.0,245.0, If you just stay seated and gaming.
245.0,246.0, You're safe.
246.0,247.0, You got it.
247.0,251.0, You got to build up those core muscles around your spine as what I hear.
251.0,252.0, And stretch.
252.0,256.0, And how do you yoga from this terrible new age back book?
256.0,260.0, That has all these really like ridiculous suggestions.
260.0,263.0, Like there's a chapter on how to deal with your pain.
263.0,270.0, And the suggestion is that you imagine that your pain is an object or an animal or a person from your life.
270.0,273.0, Like just let it appear in your mind.
273.0,276.0," You know, let the pain become something that you can speak to."
276.0,279.0," And then you have a conversation with it and ask it,"
279.0,282.0," you know, if your pain hasn't anything to tell you about yourself."
282.0,283.0, But do you do this out loud?
283.0,284.0," No, no, no."
284.0,286.0, But you have to take a virus.
286.0,287.0, Especially on the bus.
287.0,288.0, Yeah.
288.0,289.0," Oh, that's where that guy was."
289.0,291.0, Why are you bothering me pain?
291.0,292.0, Yeah.
292.0,294.0, It's a really retarded book.
294.0,295.0, Does it work?
295.0,298.0, It's a big metaphor for posting on like a hardcore video game forum.
298.0,300.0, How's it?
300.0,301.0, Name your pain.
301.0,302.0," Well, that's your pain."
302.0,305.0, And then go on there and ask him to abuse you some more.
305.0,307.0, I'm going to tell you about that.
307.0,308.0, I'm going to let him go.
308.0,310.0, I've worked out somehow on my head.
310.0,311.0, I see.
311.0,314.0, But that's that's all I've all been up to.
314.0,316.0, Basically pain.
316.0,318.0," Yeah, I got a floor."
318.0,320.0, I lay on the floor for hours a day.
320.0,321.0, It's pretty nice.
321.0,322.0, Get a lot of reading done.
322.0,324.0, Not a lot of gaming.
324.0,325.0, Like on the gaming.
325.0,327.0, On the floor because it's flattened hard.
327.0,328.0, Do you have to do it?
328.0,329.0, Yeah.
329.0,330.0, You can play a DS or something.
330.0,331.0," Yeah, that's what I do."
331.0,333.0, If you were really committed to it.
333.0,335.0, I've also played games on the floor.
335.0,337.0, Looking at the television.
337.0,338.0, Yeah.
338.0,339.0, Okay.
339.0,340.0, Yeah.
340.0,342.0, Let me just not that hard.
342.0,343.0, Right.
343.0,344.0, Yeah.
344.0,345.0, We would be hard though.
345.0,346.0, We need some we fit.
346.0,348.0," Yeah, it's not that user recommend position."
348.0,350.0, We fit back.
350.0,351.0, Like recovery.
351.0,352.0, Back injury.
352.0,353.0, We fit.
353.0,354.0, Isn't that out in this country yet?
354.0,355.0, Is that right?
355.0,356.0, I don't think so.
356.0,357.0, No.
357.0,358.0, No.
358.0,359.0, It's not.
359.0,360.0, It's really.
360.0,361.0, It's not.
361.0,362.0, It's not.
362.0,363.0, It's not.
363.0,364.0, You're not going to buy it.
364.0,365.0, Yeah.
365.0,371.0," I would be interested if they actually make something fun that is, you know, actually"
371.0,372.0, beneficial to health.
372.0,377.0," I mean, I played a, I've played a long time ago that PS2 game"
377.0,378.0, Kinetic.
378.0,379.0, Do you guys remember this?
379.0,382.0, It was an I toy game that was for exercise and it's sponsored by.
382.0,383.0, Yeah.
383.0,384.0, Yeah.
384.0,385.0, Yeah.
385.0,387.0," And it had, you know, had like good production values and it was supposed to be"
387.0,390.0, designed by serious athletic trainers.
390.0,393.0, And it was supposed to do all these exercises and basically use the eye to
393.0,396.0, it to make sure you were doing what you were supposed to be doing.
396.0,398.0," And it was really, really terrible."
398.0,400.0," I mean, not fun."
400.0,404.0," And it made me feel like I was, you know, doing damage to my body."
404.0,406.0, And that's what I worry about.
406.0,407.0, We fit.
407.0,410.0," It's like, can you really trust a video game to tell you how to exercise?"
410.0,411.0, Because right.
411.0,414.0," I have a feeling it's like, and that looks to like brain age in terms of like what"
414.0,415.0, it's doing to your brain.
415.0,416.0, Yeah.
416.0,417.0, Because I can't.
417.0,420.0, I can't really help my mental faculty.
420.0,421.0, Yes.
421.0,423.0, How to say that the we sports game.
423.0,425.0, I got a lot of exercise that of that.
425.0,430.0, That's that's really a lot more compared to what I normally get.
430.0,435.0, Compared to what I compare what I would get sitting at my PC playing.
435.0,438.0," I would say boxing one was a little that yeah, the boxing particular."
438.0,442.0," I did the boxer thing, but no, that's exhausting."
442.0,444.0, Even the even the tennis can be.
444.0,446.0, We sports the dumbest thing.
446.0,447.0, I never seen.
447.0,448.0, No way.
448.0,449.0, Why?
449.0,452.0, I played it for like 10 minutes and then we don't like sports.
452.0,454.0, How do you know you know you like tennis?
454.0,455.0, You do.
455.0,457.0, I like Mike Tyson's punch out.
457.0,460.0, Made you like tennis or Nintendo's tennis?
460.0,461.0," No, I like I."
461.0,463.0, I was like tennis video.
463.0,465.0, There's not that big of a difference.
465.0,467.0, I am a fan of tennis videos in general.
467.0,468.0, How about golf?
468.0,471.0, Or do you just like Mario golf?
471.0,474.0, A few honest like Mario golf is the only kind of golf game I've played.
474.0,475.0, How did I know?
475.0,478.0, But I've never tried like Tiger Woods or anything.
478.0,480.0, So I don't know if I would enjoy that.
480.0,483.0," And in the new, I don't know if we can say this."
483.0,485.0, Is a blood bowl.
485.0,486.0, We could talk about the.
486.0,488.0, Is it putting on?
488.0,489.0, I was brought in there.
489.0,493.0, So I guess we said we'll write a brought a wrote about blood ball in the upcoming
493.0,499.0," issue of GFW and the lead is like you know, what is like it's like football"
499.0,500.0, dumbest thing ever.
500.0,502.0, Football with or it's awesome.
502.0,503.0, All right.
503.0,507.0, Add some works in some biases there.
507.0,510.0, It's only region you guys have me writing about that.
510.0,511.0, It was because they were to orcs in.
511.0,515.0, You're a kind of a go-to orcs guy.
515.0,518.0, So how do you decide that when it's a game about football and orcs like does
518.0,520.0, it get the football guy or the orcs guy like how do you?
520.0,523.0, Well that's easy because we don't have a football guy here.
523.0,526.0," Yeah, so go to the arc guy by default."
526.0,527.0, I don't know.
527.0,528.0, I really back to we sports.
528.0,531.0, I thought that we bowling is the best we game around.
531.0,541.0, I was like getting like visibly like frustrated with it in front of my own kid.
541.0,544.0, It was as embarrassing I had her going like dad.
544.0,545.0, It's okay.
545.0,546.0, It's fine.
546.0,547.0, No it's not.
547.0,551.0, Why isn't always curving to the last my head's not curving?
551.0,553.0, Why is it another gutter ball?
553.0,555.0, Did you ever have the power pad?
555.0,557.0, I don't know what that is.
557.0,558.0, The power.
559.0,562.0, I think that might be a bit before it's time.
562.0,563.0, After it's time.
563.0,564.0, Yes.
564.0,565.0, You guys know what the power pad is.
565.0,566.0," Yes, I have the power pad."
566.0,570.0, It's the thing that you have your friends over and you put in track and field or whatever.
570.0,573.0, And then you lay on the floor and you fucking pound on it.
573.0,575.0," Yeah, faster, faster."
575.0,577.0, And you never do what you're supposed to do.
577.0,578.0, You just cheat.
578.0,579.0, Right.
579.0,580.0, That's it.
580.0,582.0, It was like a pat.
582.0,583.0, It was a pad.
583.0,584.0, It was a pad.
584.0,585.0, It's just a yard on it.
585.0,586.0, And you're supposed to run on it.
586.0,587.0, Except kids just cheated and pound it on it.
587.0,588.0, And you're supposed to do that.
588.0,590.0, I was reading you could do that with we fit.
590.0,593.0, You could fix you just pick up the board with your hands and just shake it around.
593.0,594.0, I'm first.
594.0,595.0, Yeah.
595.0,596.0, First then why did you buy it?
596.0,599.0," You're not buying we fit to like win a game, right?"
599.0,601.0, I guess some people are.
601.0,602.0, Some people will do that.
602.0,605.0," Well, if you're buying we fit to exercise like."
605.0,607.0, I don't get that.
607.0,609.0, That's desperation.
609.0,610.0, Yeah.
610.0,611.0, Yeah.
611.0,612.0, I have miles of beach.
612.0,615.0, I could run down outside of my door that I don't.
615.0,616.0, I'm not going to buy we've.
616.0,617.0, You're the beach.
617.0,618.0, Mm-hmm.
618.0,619.0, It's nice.
619.0,621.0, It's a little faster except it's really foggy most of the time.
621.0,622.0, Yeah.
622.0,626.16," Actually, I feel a little bit dumb when I go to the the why I remember if the Berkeley"
626.16,631.0," Y and and one of the things I always do there is I run on the treadmill, which is"
631.0,633.0, this kind of a dumb thing to do in California.
633.0,638.0," You know, most of the time it's nice enough outside to run outside."
638.0,639.0, Mm-hmm.
639.0,642.0," But yeah, I'm running in place on this on this machine."
642.0,644.0, Except that I can run on a treadmill.
644.0,649.0," And if I try to run on the street within 10 minutes, I'm like throwing up on the pavement"
649.0,651.0, and heaving and.
651.0,653.0, It's like way way more high impact.
653.0,654.0, You're throwing up?
654.0,655.0," Well, okay."
655.0,657.0, I might be exaggerating a little bit.
657.0,662.0, But I'm giving up at the very at the very least I'm giving up.
662.0,663.0, Yeah.
663.0,664.0, That's different.
664.0,665.0, Throwing up.
665.0,666.0, Yeah.
666.0,667.0, Okay.
667.0,668.0, You caught me.
668.0,670.0, I'm sorry.
670.0,673.0," I mean, can you actually run down the street for you?"
673.0,678.0," Well, the problem there is like the traffic light and other people and, you know, all that"
678.0,680.0, always bugs a shit enemy.
680.0,685.0," And also I can control my pace on the, you know, you run, are you running down the street?"
685.0,687.0," Like, it tops me."
687.0,689.0, What's going on?
689.0,693.0," I don't, I guess I lacked the ability to run my, you know, really slowly."
693.0,694.0, That kind of drives me crazy.
694.0,695.0, The little sort of hop.
695.0,696.0, You got a pace yourself.
696.0,697.0, That's called jogging.
697.0,698.0, Yeah.
698.0,699.0, Yeah.
699.0,700.0, Yeah.
700.0,701.0, Yeah.
701.0,703.0, I'm more of a bicycle guy.
703.0,704.0, Yeah.
704.0,706.0, Do we have anything to talk about this week?
706.0,709.0, We're just kind of rambling along here.
709.0,710.0, There's the things to talk about.
710.0,711.0, We do.
711.0,712.0, Yeah.
712.0,713.0," You know, you print some stuff out."
713.0,714.0, I printed out a couple things.
714.0,719.0," We were going to, we're skipping a what you're playing because we're all playing the same thing we always do."
719.0,721.0, So those who are wondering what we're playing.
721.0,725.0, Sean's playing company here as.
725.0,727.0," And TFT, right?"
727.0,730.0," Well, we'll talk about TFT because there's some cool stuff to talk about there."
730.0,733.0," And I'm playing puzzle quest, Ryan."
733.0,734.0, Awesome.
734.0,743.0," And I'm liking it, but I don't think I can, I can, I can go pass the, the jeweled with, with man I think."
743.0,748.0," I think any, any attempt to say that it's any more than that, I think fails."
748.0,751.0, And I now have enough hours into it that I can.
751.0,755.0, Have you gotten into the thing like where you're building structures and all that?
755.0,756.0, Yeah.
756.0,757.0, Yeah.
758.0,768.0," Yeah. So now my castle, whatever that is, as a mage tower and a dungeon cool and some other building and have captured a couple dudes who are in the dungeon."
768.0,769.0, All right.
769.0,771.0, And yet still all I'm doing is playing the jeweled.
771.0,774.0, But you have like more spells and stuff.
774.0,775.0, Right.
775.0,778.0, Which I use while putting three gems together.
778.0,779.0," Well, yeah."
779.0,782.0, So that's all this game is.
782.0,783.0, It's a good one.
783.0,786.0," It's a very nice version of the jeweled, but that's all this."
786.0,789.0," Well, Clathi, you play."
789.0,796.0," I'm a knight, which just means it's important for me to put red jewels together."
796.0,807.0," I don't necessarily see how this is different than the average hack and slash RPG that it's like replace the bejeweled with, you know, space bar, space bar, click click click or whatever the hell you guys do."
807.0,810.0," Like mouse click click click click click, same thing, you know, fighting."
810.0,812.0," Yes, totally different."
813.0,818.0," Because those are like sword swings every mouse click is act, you know, I'm really fighting in those."
818.0,820.0, But you're not actually swinging a sword.
820.0,822.0, It's like an abstraction in my mind.
822.0,823.0, I am.
823.0,826.0, I'm in that isometric perspective there.
826.0,828.0, I'm in that world.
828.0,832.0," You know, it's not an abstracted plane of of gems."
832.0,833.0, I've seen him play.
833.0,834.0, He wears chain mail while playing.
834.0,835.0, See?
835.0,838.0," Oh, Jesus."
838.0,841.0, So have you have you grouped up with anyone and gone into a dungeon?
841.0,842.0, Yeah.
842.0,844.0, Can you do that?
844.0,845.0, No.
845.0,846.0, Oh.
846.0,847.0, Okay.
847.0,848.0, That'd be weird.
848.0,849.0, Go up.
849.0,850.0, Jeweling.
850.0,851.0, Yeah.
851.0,852.0, I do like it.
852.0,853.0, I think it's great.
853.0,855.0," But it's, it's a bit of a stretch."
855.0,858.0, I think the say that this is an RPG in any way shape or form.
858.0,860.0, You're all insane.
860.0,861.0, I haven't played it.
861.0,863.0, So I don't know what I'm saying.
863.0,864.0, Maybe maybe not you.
864.0,870.0," I can't even, you know, to me, the text is exactly like the text and any other game like this too."
870.0,871.0, I'm just clicking pass it.
871.0,872.0, Give me the next text.
872.0,874.0, This is text is dumb.
874.0,876.0, That's the only part that you are peeing.
876.0,879.0," If you're not even listening to it, then what is it about it?"
879.0,880.0, That's an RPG.
880.0,882.0, But do you read the text in a while?
882.0,883.0," Oh, a little bit."
883.0,884.0, Yeah.
884.0,885.0, I've never read the text in a while.
885.0,889.0, It tells me how many Gorotask livers I have to pick up.
889.0,891.0," Well, those ones I don't tend to read."
891.0,892.0, But if I get the sense of it.
892.0,893.0, That's basically what you will get.
893.0,894.0, That's basically what you will get.
894.0,895.0, Huh?
895.0,896.0, That's what the jewel is giving you.
896.0,897.0, It's telling you to go.
897.0,898.0, Go here and.
898.0,899.0, You mean puzzle quest?
899.0,902.0," Oh, oh, go hide it."
902.0,903.0, I just shot myself.
903.0,905.0," Okay, we can."
905.0,907.0, We're going for.
907.0,911.0, Now that you fuck yourself.
911.0,913.0, So why need you guys to that time?
913.0,914.0," Team, team port is too."
914.0,915.0, What's up?
915.0,917.0, It's pretty awesome.
917.0,921.0, There was some rather amusing video post to the other day.
921.0,922.0," Oh, Sean."
922.0,923.0, Sean knows more about that.
923.0,924.0, I just got the teller into this.
924.0,926.0, Sean doesn't like the talk in the brood.
926.0,927.0, Yeah.
927.0,929.0," Okay, we didn't post that video yet."
929.0,930.0," Oh, it's not up."
930.0,932.0," No, you saw some of the unended footage."
932.0,934.0," Oh, and that we're putting together."
934.0,935.0, Okay.
935.0,936.0, I got a sneak peek.
936.0,939.0," But, um, yeah, been fired up."
939.0,940.0, Take a break from coming here.
940.0,945.0, Just play some team fortress to again and getting ready for some of the new contents.
945.0,950.0, Such as Badlands remake of one of my favorite team portures classic maps.
950.0,955.0, I was trying to show Ryan that the other day and team fortress classic is why it would be cool.
955.0,960.0," And the things that that they could do with it in team fortress too, because it was this really."
960.0,965.0," I mean, they keep saying it's a vertical map, which it is because it occurs in this canyon."
965.0,967.0, And there are all these battlements in the original.
967.0,972.0," There are all these, you know, sort of battlements along the canyon walls that are connected to your base."
972.0,983.0," You can either come out of your base and hang out up there, put centuries, snipe from it, defend or if you're the opposing team, you know, you can grenade jump and rocket jump your way into these back entries or go right through the main."
983.0,991.0," You sort of castle gate looking scenario, but it just it was always the map had a feel that was pretty different than all the other."
991.0,993.0," And, um, in the all the other."
993.0,995.0, I want to talk about the other.
995.0,1005.0," I don't the other map that I do know about, but I don't think I am able to one thing we don't know for certain is that they said that they're going to introduce some significant changes to the medic."
1005.0,1012.0, And we don't know if this is simply the achievement packed that they're adding to it or if they're doing something to the mechanics of the way that the medic class plays.
1012.0,1020.0," Because we know, you know, when they look at all their stat tracking and stuff that medic is like the least played class right now, if you used hours put into it."
1020.0,1030.0," And that's a wrong that they want to write and who knows, you know, are they going to do that by putting in the ability to infect the enemy again? I don't know."
1030.0,1031.0, That'd be awesome.
1031.0,1035.0," That's why people are thinking, but I don't know if that's going to happen because."
1035.0,1039.0," Rod and Walker, you know, with the co-creators of the game, was really adamant that."
1039.0,1049.0," What that mechanic always did do the game was make it so that you wanted to avoid your teammates because if they were carrying some infectious disease, you'd see them."
1049.0,1051.0, And just the chance that they weren't affected.
1051.0,1053.0, You don't want to have anything to do with them.
1053.0,1058.0, And so you take this team base game and you create conditions where no one on the same team ever wants to be around one another.
1058.0,1061.0, And they wanted to eliminate that whole thing in the first place.
1061.0,1067.0," Maybe it's kind of like, I don't know. I mean, I would be surprised if they bring that because they they seem so."
1067.0,1071.0, Confidence that it was a bad idea that I would.
1071.0,1073.0, I would surprise that they didn't have something.
1073.0,1077.0," It was in the middle of a level of paranoia already kind of there with the spy. I mean, yeah, right."
1077.0,1084.0," It's like the psychology there isn't exactly that that that was the point that we made, you know, when we first heard about this and that was the exercise."
1084.0,1089.0," Well, what about the fact that any one of your teammates could be the enemy ready to write in the back?"
1089.0,1093.0," I mean, you just shoot him. You just whenever anybody walks up to you."
1093.0,1097.0," But still there's the whole aspect of, you don't want to be near the backstabber."
1097.0,1106.0," Well, and you don't the other thing about it is that because of the character animations and sort of the silhouettes of the characters and all that everything reads well in a distance in this game."
1106.0,1115.0," You know, you can just you can ascertain so many things about the states of the characters and from far away that they could make you clearly infected with some."
1115.0,1127.0," Oh, yeah, totally. And you would know from from any distance like this guy's puking, you know, he's running around and he's like doing whatever they have him do, sweating and puking, then you stay away from them unless you're medic and then you heal him."
1127.0,1138.0," But it does make, I mean, that would address something about the medic for me and is that it's it's an invaluable class for your team, but it's just not a role that I want to play."
1138.0,1144.0," Well, so it's a is a point purpose of adding it to give them something more offensive to do."
1144.0,1152.0," We're just if they have it. If it's not. Yes, right. But I mean, in theory, that's why they would do it to make it more appealing as an offensive class."
1152.0,1157.0, I don't just to give you something to do that basically follow a teammate around.
1157.0,1163.0," And now instead of Ryan, you were just saying that one of the recent patches made it so that you don't even have to hold the button down to continue to heal him."
1163.0,1168.0, Right. You can just keep it going. So now you're basically just that seems blocking around.
1168.0,1173.0," Yeah, and somebody who enjoyed playing the medic, that strikes me as a bit much."
1173.0,1177.0," I mean, can you really not hold down one button? You're not doing anything else."
1177.0,1192.0," I mean, they've they've done subtle things that you could tell that it's been a difficult problem to solve for them because they've another tweak they made is that you get more points is a medic and you heal people more rapidly by switching back and forth between targets."
1192.0,1195.0, So then instead of just following the one guy around the whole time.
1195.0,1200.0," You're constantly looking and evaluating who is going to make the best use of this, who needs it the most."
1200.0,1207.0," And if you're a good player, you're going to also not be afraid to switch to your hyper-dermit gun and shoot people with that switched to your bone saw."
1207.0,1217.0," When you, you know, when the opportunity arises, when you think you see a spy and stuff like that, it might be cool if they'd give you more things to do with the upper charge and maybe different levels that you could do it at."
1217.0,1220.0, Like give you a bar that has like three things just for a lot of street fighters.
1220.0,1224.0," Yeah, totally street fires up like you could give the upper charge once you filled up three bars or something."
1224.0,1232.0, I've seen I've seen some people speculate that they might introduce some sort of mechanic for the medic to break someone else's over charge.
1232.0,1233.0, Like the counter it.
1233.0,1234.0, That would be cool.
1234.0,1235.0, That might be cool.
1235.0,1246.0," That that's what I was thinking of actually before too. Yeah, where you can make it to the hyper-dermics like you get enough of those and to someone and it takes away their their over charge."
1247.0,1248.0, Maybe it's done some or something.
1248.0,1249.0, Make a dish.
1249.0,1252.0, So are you still playing around?
1252.0,1255.0, I was playing some couple nights ago.
1255.0,1259.0," Yeah, when Sean was carrying out this hilarity."
1259.0,1262.0, You make it sound hilarious with that.
1262.0,1263.0, Usually the word hilarity.
1263.0,1273.0," The more we got is that it's just for morning to do something different and also because the, I mean, now with a few of the Ralphie style."
1273.0,1275.0," Yeah, grieving videos that."
1275.0,1279.0, It's immediately familiar to quite a few people if you go in and do that voice.
1279.0,1282.0," Not every time, but I've actually done it and I've heard someone."
1282.0,1289.0," Well, there's the addition of the people on my friends list who pop up in games and they don't realize who they are and as soon as you do it, they ruin it by going."
1289.0,1290.0, Sean.
1290.0,1297.0," But now there's people who don't know you and immediately go, oh shit, it's that guy from the YouTube."
1298.0,1307.0," One time someone said that and I was like, crap, they already, they're already on to me and then they were talking about a different one that I think to do it and I was like, oh awesome."
1307.0,1309.0, It's a different asshole.
1309.0,1311.0, So the new solution.
1311.0,1322.0," It goes back to we bring you to you, and we take the vlogs or video blogs of just the most vile obnoxious or just plain, you know,"
1322.0,1327.0," knit weighted people that post their own videos on YouTube, so like all of them."
1327.0,1332.0," Yeah, they have, there's a clear hierarchy of, I mean, some are far worse than others."
1332.0,1338.0," And so, but yeah, basically people who put their webcam up and just sit there and battle at it and put it up on the."
1338.0,1349.0," Yeah, the one guy that I watched that or the video I watched, it's perfect because that guy's known us for kind of going on and on kind of stream of conscious and it's just perfect for."
1350.0,1353.0," So what we do, yes, the guy you're talking about, we take demonious ex."
1353.0,1357.0," He, he's a guy who's he was an infamous YouTube troll."
1357.0,1368.0," I mean, a troll being just so when he starts shit on on YouTube and gets an all these arguments and he has left YouTube and deleted is account three times already."
1368.0,1374.0," And in the past month, he did it once more signed off from YouTube for good left is farewell and fuck you video."
1374.0,1382.0," But other people he's infamous because videos are so incriminating that as soon as one would ever go up, they would immediately make their own archive version of it."
1382.0,1391.0, And so now you can go on YouTube under the account deleted demonious someone else who kept the archive and put them all back up right after demonious took them all down.
1391.0,1394.0," So this guy, I mean, to give you an idea of the sorts of bullshit that he talks about."
1394.0,1403.0," And he one day he might be on some misogynist rant because his ex, because his girlfriend dumped him and then you find out, of course, that he's 21 is ex girlfriend was."
1403.0,1408.0," And he's the one is ex girlfriend was a 16 year old, in St. Kompossy fan who we met on your personal."
1408.0,1414.0," Yeah, very upset about this and then maybe the next video he put up the day after is him sort of advocating."
1414.0,1421.0, The virtues of the flesh light as an alternative to actual intercourse.
1421.0,1427.0, So we take these videos then and we just go into team fortress and you change your name to demonious sex.
1428.0,1430.0, And you just play them as your play.
1430.0,1432.0, But because he's so.
1432.0,1439.0," And he gets so worked up and so angry and he's yelling, half the time is yelling, he's responding to other vloggers who are ripping him."
1439.0,1445.0," And he'll like, he wears fingerless mesh gloves, which is perfect."
1445.0,1449.0," The other thing about this guy, I need to paint a picture. I mean, he's probably about like 400 pounds or so."
1450.0,1456.0," And I don't know, like a four foot five frame and he he's convinced that he's the toughest guy."
1456.0,1463.0," And he's like, you know, he just like, uh, beating his fist into his palm saying like, I want to just beat all your little Latino heads."
1463.0,1465.0, But but I can't do that.
1465.0,1476.0, Because you're on the other side of computer and then like then he'll just go right back up to rage and that's another story about why his Latino heads on the and that is actually pretty good.
1476.0,1487.0," You see, as you play this shit, the moral of the story that people react instantly, it sounds real. It sounds perfect. Like it sounds just like there's this guy in your server and he's deciding to ran."
1487.0,1492.0," He's drinking beers, he's going off on all this stuff. And so people can verse with him the entire time."
1492.0,1499.0," And the good part is just to see how they react, the conversations that into even though it's just this video playing."
1500.0,1509.0, Another one that we have going is is where he says that his brother showed him another YouTube and he's now understands that it's the end of the world at the end times are here.
1509.0,1521.0," And he's asking everyone to open up their Bible, he's talking about, you know, how world or three is going to begin with their ran and how it's going to, you know, bring in Russia and all the shit and how the Milky Way is going to spin out of the galaxy."
1521.0,1537.0," And he also talks about it because he's such a woman hater because of the insane clown posse fan how, you know, a women are useless and men do everything in the world. So he's talked to, he's gone on it, linked about how Thomas Edison built electricity."
1537.0,1540.0, That word actually built it.
1540.0,1544.0," But yeah, people come to the electricity."
1544.0,1549.0, It's it's great because because you're not pausing this thing. Are you just running?
1549.0,1558.0," It's because yeah, he has these long pauses and then he just starts to go in and really just sounds actually like this guy's playing the game and this is randomly thrown the shit out."
1558.0,1561.0," And it's so funny here that people go on like, you know,"
1561.0,1564.0, or knowing that they don't another listening to a tape or something.
1564.0,1572.0," They thought he was a viral marketer for fleshlight.com and they thought like that, but what what in soon is the 20 minute testimony."
1572.0,1579.0," I've been telling you, you know, just how life like it feels and how it never gives him a headache unlike the insane clown posse fan."
1579.0,1586.0," And so people have all kinds of stuff to say about all that and they're, and then he comes back when we just queue up the next video."
1586.0,1601.0," And we do those. We try to create a sense of narrative and development is emotion. So we might have like four different videos and you pick them and you play them in order. It's like a good DJ, you know, you got it's not playing records like you're creating something greater than the some of the parts."
1601.0,1607.0, By starting off with him upset about the girlfriend then killing up to the one about fleshlight then him getting into sinking.
1607.0,1611.0, Then him being really angry because we know that that was going to make people laugh at him.
1611.0,1621.0," People hate him. Then he goes into the end of the world's feel. You know the whole thing works like, well, if I'm if I'm going out, you know when people get old and then that that's when they're always convinced that the end times are here."
1621.0,1625.0," It's like, it's gonna be the end of my life. It's gonna be the end of all yours."
1625.0,1633.0, There's nothing you guys can do about it. So we just kind of bring that in the play and we'll put this video up soon. Hopefully.
1633.0,1642.0, I was the victim of some of your shenanigans because the one time that I've played team fortress in the past like two months I got online enjoying the game and you guys were running that crazy Ron Paul guy.
1642.0,1644.0," Yeah, you heard? Yeah, yeah, yeah."
1644.0,1646.0, That was hit. That was the most of your sex.
1646.0,1653.0," I didn't know you guys were doing that and I got on and I was like, oh, God, I hate the internet."
1654.0,1658.0," You just like, I can't I don't write a shit anymore."
1658.0,1676.0," That's the one where he's talking about the eumaro. The other side of the times is that you know, there's like a European Union and an African union and that there's going to be a North American union and they're going to take away our precious dollar bills that have a god we trust and give us this thing called the eumaro and that that's the other side of the end times."
1676.0,1678.0, It was the eumaro.
1678.0,1685.0, I think Robert got a taste of the eumaro. Yeah. So you heard this. So you heard it. I was totally convincing to me.
1685.0,1691.0, I didn't. I didn't get it. You knew you were in a server with Sean right? I know.
1691.0,1696.0, I don't know and I didn't hear them making any comments. It should have been obviously.
1696.0,1699.0, They were playing in this on this team.
1699.0,1706.0," Another good sources is guy called Dave Master 42 and I actually wanted to start off our podcast with some clips from Dave Master,"
1706.0,1710.0," but I just don't know like if we're able to. All right. You know, I just don't know how that works."
1710.0,1716.0," I was like, I think they did shit right. If you put some shit on YouTube, it's kind of like, hey world have fun."
1716.0,1719.0, Right. Make animated gifts of me.
1719.0,1724.0, Like do everything put me on YTM&D. Fuck by a world up.
1724.0,1728.0, So it's like the invites there. I just need to find out if it actually is legal.
1728.0,1735.0, But Dave Master is kind of like this like sweetly retarded dude who does these series of unboxings of video games.
1735.0,1738.0, He works at like a target or something right.
1738.0,1743.0," Bringing shopping carts back and now and then he'll find a person, a parking lot and this man and he'll give to his manager."
1743.0,1746.0," And if no one claims it's manager, let's have some of the money in it."
1746.0,1749.0, It can't be target then because there's no way they would advocate that policy.
1749.0,1751.0, So it must be some smaller store.
1751.0,1756.0, And then he like he this one time he bought like a pink DS with the money that was in the person he found.
1756.0,1761.0, And then he unboxed that. He and he's just like he starts every everyone off with.
1761.0,1763.0, Hey everybody.
1763.0,1765.0, Like he always does.
1765.0,1766.0, Oh the guy who coughs.
1766.0,1774.0, Yeah he has that cup that he does every time and he also spends the entirety of his taping sessions going like snording.
1774.0,1778.0, Boogers or whatever periodically.
1778.0,1785.0," And he he's got some red stuff too. It's just for one it's you know, we've made fun of like unboxing videos in general right."
1785.0,1786.0, Sure.
1786.0,1788.0, And this guy's got it down to a science.
1788.0,1790.0, You mean our own unboxing video.
1790.0,1791.0, Yeah.
1791.0,1793.0, The halo three unboxing.
1793.0,1798.0, This guy this guy will seriously break it down like he'll he'll let you know everything that he finds in the manual.
1798.0,1800.0, He'll the other thing.
1800.0,1802.0, It's kind of fun seeing if he can do it or not.
1802.0,1807.0," It's like, no, what's something that I think know you're analogy I can use."
1807.0,1812.0, Or where you hope someone accomplish something which never sure if they're going to quite make it.
1812.0,1813.0, Want him to do it.
1813.0,1814.0, So for him.
1814.0,1815.0, So for him.
1815.0,1816.0, So for him.
1816.0,1818.0, And this guy's opening just simply opening packaging is that much of a challenge.
1818.0,1820.0, These expenses the whole time doing it and they'll drop something.
1820.0,1822.0," Oh, crud."
1822.0,1823.0, And then like.
1823.0,1829.0, Fish it out of the ground or the box sort of but he's good to you just play an unboxing.
1829.0,1830.0, In your.
1830.0,1834.0, You're team for just game and people are just like cool some dude just got some shit.
1834.0,1837.0, Let's share his moment of joy with the same goal and they believe it.
1837.0,1842.0, Same way that they don't question that demonius X is sitting there with an open Bible on one hand and a mouse and the other.
1842.0,1849.0, I have no problem imagining that the guy who's playing and killing them is also opening up like guitar here or three and.
1849.0,1851.0, Possibility is a really endless there.
1851.0,1855.0, You could get video archives of you know Malcolm Max.
1855.0,1860.0, Anybody just start playing stuff you know but there is a I mean there's yeah you got to do it.
1860.0,1868.0, Right way in that you you don't want to I think the wrong way would be someone's like oh this is rad let's go get some Arnold Schwarzenegger sound boards and go play.
1868.0,1873.0, And then you have like 20 minutes of everyone going getting the chopper and it's like.
1873.0,1880.0, To shut up and then you even I'll leave for that but that's the thing like if I heard demonius in a server out of stay I like it.
1880.0,1883.0, Lesson must be laugh at that too.
1883.0,1884.0, Yeah.
1884.0,1885.0, Yeah.
1885.0,1890.0, I'm just that that that yeah was thinking of like oh great now we're going to get more.
1890.0,1892.0, Keep it because you back to get an epidemic.
1892.0,1893.0, Oh no.
1893.0,1897.0, That's the usual like that's so juvenile why would you do that.
1897.0,1900.0, Well we're juvenile people here.
1900.0,1902.0, If you have W rain you don't get hurt.
1902.0,1903.0, Plane.
1903.0,1904.0, Plane.
1904.0,1905.0, You're just to is juvenile like.
1905.0,1906.0, Yeah.
1906.0,1907.0, Yeah.
1907.0,1908.0, Let's talk about video games here.
1908.0,1909.0, Geez.
1909.0,1910.0, Yeah.
1910.0,1911.0, But.
1911.0,1916.0, Some gamers are more sophisticated and general than your average console gamer or so I've read on the internet.
1916.0,1917.0, Oh.
1918.0,1921.0, Well that's good you haven't played any games with a family.
1921.0,1922.0, Yeah.
1922.0,1923.0, No.
1923.0,1931.0, I was reading a thread in which in which it was we were it was postulated that we are we this podcast
1931.0,1938.0, Cateres to the younger console gaming crowd which is why we are so pathetically immature.
1938.0,1946.0, And I didn't respond to that thread but my internal feeling was no actually we're just immature and we just talk this way.
1946.0,1950.0, We're not catering to a crowd calculated ever.
1950.0,1951.0, Yeah.
1951.0,1952.0, Yeah.
1952.0,1953.0, Yeah.
1953.0,1955.0, We're not this this this this is maturity is not calculated for a demographic.
1955.0,1956.0, He.
1956.0,1964.0, I was sitting here during the the so called planning stage of this podcast and I can testify that there is no ability to.
1964.0,1967.0, We're a graph or design.
1967.0,1969.0, What will happen.
1969.0,1972.0, There's a there's a distinct lack of energy this week.
1972.0,1973.0, I think it's fair to say.
1973.0,1975.0, I think we're yet again at that.
1976.0,1979.0, We just came off as one of them crazy cycles.
1979.0,1981.0, We did we took so much time off with the break.
1981.0,1986.0, We came right back into how weak and it's just been going on and on and on and on and on and on and on and teams.
1986.0,1987.0, Yeah.
1987.0,1988.0, Almost over.
1988.0,1989.0, We're almost done.
1989.0,1990.0, Yeah.
1990.0,1995.0, You guys should do like an experiment where you could you know do that reality reality TV like confessional camera.
1995.0,2002.0, Except just have it be a tape recorder so that as you're doing the issue you just like Sean can pull aside the tape recorder and be like.
2002.0,2003.0, Today was so shitty man.
2003.0,2008.0, Jeff was so mean to me and it was like edit them together.
2008.0,2009.0, Like a plan.
2009.0,2010.0, It's a product sort of thing or.
2010.0,2013.0," No, no like just straight up you know the real world."
2013.0,2014.0, I see.
2014.0,2015.0, Okay.
2015.0,2016.0, I know exactly what you're saying.
2016.0,2018.0, Like our Kelly's real talk.
2018.0,2020.0, So somebody should like a reality show and a thing.
2020.0,2021.0, That's an amazing.
2021.0,2023.0, That's a good as video.
2023.0,2024.0, That's what we should do.
2024.0,2029.0, We could buy each of us gets a little visual recorder that whenever we feel like walking in the confederate.
2029.0,2030.0, Yeah.
2030.0,2031.0, Yeah.
2031.0,2032.0, Yeah.
2032.0,2033.0, Yeah.
2033.0,2036.0, I don't know why all the guys are being mean to me today.
2036.0,2037.0, That kind of thing.
2037.0,2038.0, Exactly.
2038.0,2039.0, Because next up model.
2039.0,2046.0, Or you know I'm about to throw my fucking keyboard out the window because I hate this game and I hate myself and I want to die.
2046.0,2048.0, It's a good idea.
2048.0,2049.0, Yeah.
2049.0,2050.0, Yeah.
2050.0,2051.0, Nice.
2051.0,2052.0, Nice collage of all kinds of stuff.
2052.0,2053.0, Yes.
2053.0,2054.0," Would you want to do that, Ryan?"
2054.0,2056.0, Will you be on our reality show?
2056.0,2057.0, Will you confess?
2057.0,2058.0, Okay.
2058.0,2064.0, I'm going to read a news item here.
2064.0,2066.0, This is startling again.
2066.0,2068.0, That's in the PC gaming world.
2068.0,2069.0, That's it.
2069.0,2075.0, A perpetual has a stopped developing Star Trek online.
2075.0,2079.0, Propecial being the makers of the fabulously successful gods in here.
2079.0,2082.0, God's in here is which was canceled before this.
2082.0,2085.0, I thought partially so they could work more.
2085.0,2086.0, Star Trek.
2086.0,2088.0, And they're checking online which is now canceled.
2088.0,2090.0," By the way, they're not perpetual apparently anymore."
2090.0,2092.0, They're P2.
2092.0,2094.0, One of our recent issues.
2094.0,2100.0, There's a court case going on between perpetual and conki communications which is their PR firm.
2100.0,2101.0, Right.
2101.0,2106.0, Conki alleges that they are transferred all of these assets.
2106.0,2107.0," Oh, God."
2107.0,2108.0," Oh, God."
2108.0,2109.0," Sorry, dude."
2109.0,2111.0, My turn Jeff's mic down to you is really loud.
2111.0,2113.0, I just ripped my glass off my head.
2113.0,2114.0, Okay.
2114.0,2115.0, I apologize.
2115.0,2116.0, Yeah.
2116.0,2125.0, But the the allegations that they is that perpetual transferred all of a bunch of like game assets and stuff to this dummy corporation.
2125.0,2126.0, Mm-hmm.
2126.0,2129.0, Is it done corporation going to put out gods in here?
2129.0,2130.0, No.
2130.0,2131.0, I don't think so.
2131.0,2134.0, I don't think God's in here is going anywhere.
2134.0,2141.0, The story right referring to is the delay a game feature in the issue that's had a new
2141.0,2142.0, game feature.
2142.0,2143.0," Yeah, it's not a game feature."
2143.0,2145.0, But that's really happy the way the story turned out.
2145.0,2150.0," It's not only a look at games that might still be on the way right, but it've been delayed."
2150.0,2156.0, But also at the history of the most notable and classic cases of delayed and canceled games.
2156.0,2157.0, And that was a fine feature.
2157.0,2159.0," I got to say, there's a lot of stuff there."
2159.0,2160.0, It's like 24 pages.
2160.0,2161.0, Yeah.
2161.0,2165.0, It's kind of a negotiation in the history of PC gaming in a way.
2165.0,2166.0, Right.
2166.0,2168.0, If you pick it up and you don't know what you're going to do.
2168.0,2171.0, It's a complete game so it actually did end up coming out.
2171.0,2172.0," In some cases, they did."
2172.0,2173.0, And some ended up being good.
2173.0,2174.0, Right.
2174.0,2175.0, It's really different for them.
2175.0,2176.0, Right.
2176.0,2178.0," But you see themes that develop throughout it, too."
2178.0,2183.0," You know, when you look at all the famous Microsoft MMOs that were canceled, and you see just,"
2183.0,2187.0," you know, at the time everyone was looking for their own ever quest in the same way that there's,"
2187.0,2191.0, I think we'll be able to look back like maybe even as soon as this year today.
2191.0,2192.0, Yeah.
2192.0,2196.0," After the phenomenal success of World of Warcraft, where everyone then wanted to have their World of"
2196.0,2199.0," Warcraft, and then it's like absolutely repeated itself."
2199.0,2205.0," So we're mythical and all these other games that, you know, Microsoft had under development and was like,"
2205.0,2208.0," well, maybe we're not going to catch up with ever quest."
2208.0,2211.0," It's like it happened all over again when you look at everything from, you know,"
2211.0,2219.0," auto assault to dungeons and dragons online, where we wanted a piece of the World of Warcraft and kind of came away saying,"
2219.0,2222.0," hmm, as we can't have that piece."
2222.0,2229.0," Well, I looked at the only screen chat I could find of Star Trek online today, and, you know,"
2229.0,2233.0," it's a guy in a Star Trek outfit in, you know, phasering."
2233.0,2234.0, You don't know where.
2234.0,2237.0," I've filled in an animal killing a board, right?"
2237.0,2238.0, Yeah.
2238.0,2239.0, I didn't even get that from it.
2239.0,2243.0, I got that it was the kind of like negative space using that you'll see in like a Rob life
2243.0,2244.0, old comic.
2244.0,2246.0, He's a comic book art.
2246.0,2248.0," You know, a lot of shitty comic book art."
2248.0,2252.0," You, uh, you'll see just people flexing and there's never any sense of context."
2252.0,2254.0," There's no, they're divorced from any world."
2254.0,2255.0, Like where are they at?
2255.0,2257.0, Where are they doing this?
2257.0,2258.0, And paneled a panel.
2258.0,2259.0, There's no consistency.
2259.0,2260.0, Right.
2260.0,2262.0," You know, this time they're in a yellow area."
2262.0,2263.0," That was, that was the Star Trek."
2263.0,2270.0," It was like someone, all it convinced me was that someone made a character model of a dude and put a Star Trek shirt on them."
2270.0,2271.0," Well, that is, yeah."
2271.0,2272.0, Exactly.
2272.0,2273.0," That was the point of the screenshot, maybe."
2273.0,2275.0," What, what happens with, with, and then those?"
2275.0,2281.0, It seems like there's an extraordinary number of of them that go into development and just never come out.
2281.0,2285.0," It seems like people go in and say, yeah, let's do World Warcraft."
2285.0,2288.0," And then like months later like, oh, that's expensive."
2288.0,2289.0, Yeah.
2289.0,2291.0, I think that's probably not.
2291.0,2292.0, Yeah.
2292.0,2297.0," And I think the problem is the people who, like, are playing World of Warcraft and understand why it's successful."
2297.0,2299.0, Have the realization before they start making the run.
2299.0,2302.0, I'm a mode that it's going to be fruitless.
2302.0,2303.0," It's like, I know that's not even bother."
2303.0,2307.0, I think it's the people who kind of like have heard of World of Warcraft and have some money.
2307.0,2310.0," They're like, oh, they're making a lot of money with this world of whatever."
2310.0,2312.0, I'm going to do one of those two.
2312.0,2315.0, You can convince some investors or some publishers.
2315.0,2319.0," I mean, obviously those now like Microsoft and EA and stuff."
2319.0,2323.0, They've been around for a long enough to know what's deliverable and what's not.
2323.0,2327.0, But there are still publishers out there when I'm not going to name the game.
2327.0,2331.0," You know, a few issues ago, I did a preview in the game and you know, just talking to the guys."
2331.0,2333.0, It's like they're talking to me.
2333.0,2335.0, Like they weren't able to convince me.
2335.0,2339.0, They didn't seem like they even knew their own game.
2339.0,2340.0, They didn't know the market.
2340.0,2344.0, They didn't know how it compared to other experiences that are available.
2344.0,2345.0, What people wanted it.
2345.0,2347.0," But I was like, the pitch is giving me."
2347.0,2350.0, I totally can see that them giving this to their publisher.
2350.0,2356.0," And then a publisher who has really no first time one has no understanding of this like sector being like,"
2356.0,2358.0," Wow, this sounds great."
2358.0,2359.0," Yeah, sure."
2359.0,2365.0," So I think with a smaller publisher and some investor, some venture capitalist with money to burn,"
2365.0,2369.0," you know, if you're like a good snake or salesman as a game developer,"
2369.0,2373.0, you could probably fool him into getting here and MMO developed.
2373.0,2375.0," Yeah, you should know what your workcraft numbers are."
2375.0,2376.0," Sure, exactly."
2376.0,2379.0, A little PowerPoint showing how much wow brings in every month.
2379.0,2383.0," This is, this is, they're short sighted as that for you to be like going even to pitch that."
2383.0,2386.0, Who cares what happens in a couple years when they realize and full of shit?
2386.0,2388.0," Well, I think pocket the advance."
2388.0,2392.0," There's a thing too though to be fair, like there's this case."
2392.0,2396.0," Again, it's kind of like, you know, Rob Blackfield would would would be a good example."
2396.0,2398.0, There's this guy called the Craig out.
2398.0,2406.0, Why you made the comic and then like TV show that never became a TV show called civilian justice and raven acto.
2406.0,2410.0," The people I'm describing, I'm naming these because you should actually look that guy up."
2410.0,2414.0, It's W E I C H and just search for civilian justice.
2414.0,2418.0," Okay, and they're very much like the guy in American movie, the documentary that we share."
2418.0,2420.0, We talked about before.
2420.0,2424.0," I'm using far too many comparisons here, but I'm hoping one of them will make sense to someone out there."
2424.0,2426.0, So you've got three to choose from now.
2426.0,2430.0," But basically, yeah, if people that aren't necessarily talented are able,"
2430.0,2434.0, but they're absolutely convinced in their ability to deliver it.
2434.0,2438.0," So I don't know, I guess, dancer, they're actually shot like maybe they go into it and they're pretty convinced."
2438.0,2440.0, They're buying their own bulls.
2440.0,2441.0," Right, right."
2441.0,2443.0," Where is everyone else would be like,"
2443.0,2445.0," it's not going to work, man."
2445.0,2447.0," Just like telling you know, more poor shard in the movie."
2447.0,2453.0," Well, those are movie. I mean, American movie that, hey man, you're which movie that's about alcoholics,"
2453.0,2455.0," anonymous, I don't see it going on."
2455.0,2459.0, But those are definitely the most painful demos that we have here.
2459.0,2460.0, So it's basically like a rarer.
2460.0,2467.0, The guys who come in thinking that they're showing us something great and innovative and it's just like the same old shit except it looks worse.
2467.0,2475.0," And you're just sitting there and they're like, yeah, you know, in a most real time strategy game,"
2475.0,2481.0," you don't have characters who can hit things, you know?"
2481.0,2483.0, But action is at the track.
2483.0,2484.0, So I don't know.
2484.0,2486.0, So I'm some vaguely Euro track thing.
2486.0,2490.0," But in our game, the track team, he's like, oh yeah, Euro track."
2490.0,2494.0," You can, you can do combat."
2494.0,2499.0," You're sitting there like, you, you got your head back."
2499.0,2502.0," You're like, you're like, you're right down. Oh, shit."
2502.0,2505.0," Yeah, usually I'm like drawing like myself being hanged."
2505.0,2506.0, I'm hanging.
2506.0,2510.0," All right, I'm texting, get me somebody call me."
2510.0,2511.0, So I have a meeting.
2511.0,2514.0, You're not kidding. I've seen note pads on your desk.
2514.0,2515.0, Put that very stuff on the floor.
2515.0,2516.0," Yeah, no, I'm not kidding."
2516.0,2520.0," Those are usually the ones where they'll be, you know, the developers showing you and then they'll have some, you know,"
2521.0,2523.0, PR representative there with them.
2523.0,2524.0, And you look at them both.
2524.0,2526.0," Yeah, very, very awkward."
2526.0,2528.0," And if you are a person going, show what you think."
2528.0,2530.0," Yeah, you don't want to shit on their dreams."
2530.0,2531.0, Right.
2531.0,2535.0," But do you think April Coffer, who's a cover story?"
2535.0,2539.0, That's a talk about it when you're not here in front of me.
2542.0,2545.0," Yeah, that happens to a lot of games."
2545.0,2549.0," Other games had had far different stories to them in the, in the future."
2549.0,2550.0, Right.
2550.0,2551.0," Yeah, I like to."
2551.0,2558.0," So this Star Trek MMO, I mean speaking of which, I mean, we never got a, we never, I never saw it personally."
2558.0,2568.0," We never got it demos far as I know, but just saying Star Trek MMO, just putting those two terms together to me, it just sounds like failure."
2568.0,2573.0," Why, you know, the equation for failure."
2573.0,2576.0," I mean, what about it?"
2576.0,2582.0," Well, the world of Star Trek exists on, you know, a bridge on a spaceship for one."
2582.0,2583.0, Right.
2583.0,2586.0, It's like extrapolate that to a giant universe.
2586.0,2587.0, Right.
2587.0,2590.0, Can you imagine walking through a town full of people in those fucking Star Trek out.
2590.0,2593.0," See, definitely went into many, many planets as a way team."
2593.0,2594.0," But, but who are you though?"
2594.0,2598.0," I mean, does the enterprise now hold eight million players?"
2598.0,2602.0," And that's part of the, there are many, yeah, there's lots of spinole."
2602.0,2605.0," You've never, like, had any experience with a trek you'd all."
2605.0,2609.0," That's the whole part that anyone can be anyone can put on that right,"
2609.0,2611.0," uniform, put on that, whatever that calmly thing."
2611.0,2615.0, And then hold their like dental orifice that's supposed to be a laser gun.
2615.0,2617.0," And then they're like, to get a band, right?"
2617.0,2618.0, Then they're Star Trek.
2618.0,2619.0, Right.
2619.0,2620.0, Right.
2620.0,2625.0," Like the effect of the matter for, like the Star Trek universe is that there's nothing else to do, but join the Federation."
2625.0,2627.0," Because there's like no money, so no one has like a business."
2627.0,2629.0," They're just like, well, it's going to join the Federation."
2629.0,2630.0, It's do whatever.
2630.0,2634.0," And the characters, they are, they're all defined in, in, in, so far as that they have, you know,"
2634.0,2639.0, the various species and things and in the galactic races.
2639.0,2643.0," And just like, you know, Vulcan is differs from a human in the way that I don't know."
2643.0,2646.0," There are other characters, raw meal and clean-ons and stuff."
2646.0,2647.0," No, have different headpieces."
2647.0,2652.0," They not only have different, like, shit glued on their forehead, but they also have sort of like different ways of,"
2652.0,2655.0, of like different philosophies of life.
2655.0,2656.0, That's your way.
2656.0,2657.0, Okay.
2657.0,2658.0, So it would work well.
2658.0,2660.0, You've got some pre-made races here.
2660.0,2668.0," You have, and you have people of like, a built-in audience of people who are probably not only eager to try the role-playing servers,"
2668.0,2672.0," but like, are already experienced doing it in some of the other side of the team."
2672.0,2673.0, They could actually have beat-ealing on so they could.
2673.0,2676.0," Yeah, there's some people that Vulcan is as developed or more developed."
2676.0,2677.0, You have elves.
2677.0,2678.0," Yeah, you have space combat."
2678.0,2682.0," There's a lot of that in the shows, like shift to ship combat, then they have like, like you're saying,"
2682.0,2686.0," it's not always on a, I'm not trying to become like some kind of huge Star Trek."
2686.0,2688.0," No, I think that's totally right with you."
2688.0,2692.0," I don't really, I mean, I did watch the next generation now and then when I came out,"
2692.0,2696.0," but they, I mean, they go to, and then the original, my dad was wain to that."
2696.0,2697.0, They go to different places.
2697.0,2701.0," Don't you remember Captain Kirk didn't tap all them green,"
2701.0,2705.0," babes just by like patrolling the flight deck, you know?"
2705.0,2709.0," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, to go off the ship to get into that joint."
2709.0,2711.0, They had trouble with dribbles.
2711.0,2712.0, Right.
2712.0,2715.0," I hear, but my problem is like, that's the appeal of that."
2715.0,2716.0, Maybe I'm wrong.
2716.0,2717.0, The track he had was never a fan.
2717.0,2718.0," So you guys, I'm a truck."
2718.0,2719.0, I'm talking to my ass.
2719.0,2723.0," So you may, you may correct me if I'm a trucker's right."
2723.0,2729.0," The appeal that shows seems to me, like it was largely about the character dynamics."
2729.0,2730.0, Was it not?
2730.0,2731.0, Am I talking off on that?
2731.0,2735.0," Yeah, I grew up, my mother is such a hard-core trekky slash trekker."
2735.0,2736.0, I've seen every movie.
2736.0,2741.0," So all the TV shows of the original and next generation,"
2741.0,2744.0," who was like, the religion that I was forced into."
2745.0,2748.0, And it's a soap opera.
2748.0,2749.0, Right.
2749.0,2750.0, That's sort of what I'm seeing.
2750.0,2751.0, There might be some wrestling.
2751.0,2756.0," Maybe they would make the little, you know, they shoot a beam, like once every three episodes or something."
2756.0,2758.0," You know, but there's no action and it's all."
2758.0,2760.0, There would make it about that.
2760.0,2764.0," There are more, so there are more like many morality plays."
2764.0,2767.0," Yeah, I mean, they're very concerned with ethics."
2767.0,2770.0," And you will see like even in the next generation, you could look at them."
2770.0,2773.0," And from like, you know, an ethics model, one course and say,"
2773.0,2780.0," so here's, I see Bentham in this or I see like human this and weighing the different options in the course of, you know, right?"
2780.0,2783.0, Here's the slavery metaphor episode.
2783.0,2785.0," But it's never, sometimes I don't know."
2785.0,2787.0, I'm going to defend it again or it's a little more.
2787.0,2790.0," It's not like the X men where it's like, do you get it?"
2790.0,2792.0, There are different people don't like them because they're different.
2792.0,2793.0, Right.
2793.0,2794.0, Okay.
2794.0,2795.0," I mean, there are little more."
2795.0,2798.0," I'm going to back up the bashing the start trek in general because I, again, I haven't watched enough."
2798.0,2800.0, This is more just about the game itself.
2800.0,2804.0," If you're listening, or if you're Sean Elliott and you're hearing me discharge trek,"
2804.0,2807.0, I'm admittedly coming to from a point of ignorance.
2807.0,2813.0," Well, I'm really saying is the idea of a game in that to me feels like failure because I,"
2813.0,2822.0," like didn't, didn't Star Wars online, Star Wars galaxies sort of prove the difficulty of doing this sort of thing in an MMO."
2822.0,2829.0," And partially it's to me it's because the character, what's appealing is the characters and those characters don't matter in an online game."
2829.0,2832.0, We can't all be Captain Kirk or Spock.
2832.0,2834.0," In fact, none of us will be."
2834.0,2837.0," So, hey, okay, you can be."
2837.0,2838.0, You can be Spock.
2838.0,2842.0," But I think Star Wars is, Galax is probably one of those things."
2842.0,2843.0, Like he could have had.
2843.0,2846.0," It didn't have like, I'm sure there's that."
2846.0,2848.0, It wasn't that you couldn't be Darth Vader.
2848.0,2851.0, It was just that the game took us in good.
2851.0,2856.0, I think they could have had the same character selection that they had and made a good game and people would still be playing it.
2856.0,2859.0," Okay, so what would be a good Star Trek online game?"
2859.0,2865.0, I think it's one where it's just a holiday deck and you go and you hit the button and it turns into Pac-Man.
2865.0,2868.0, And you can have a treble as a pass.
2868.0,2870.0, Think about the possibility of the holiday deck.
2870.0,2871.0, Yes.
2871.0,2872.0, Pac-Man.
2872.0,2874.0, Super Mario Brothers.
2874.0,2875.0, Final fantasy.
2875.0,2877.0, Just recycle all that shit.
2877.0,2882.0," You take, what if instead though you take some elements from like Eve online and then you take some,"
2882.0,2892.0," I think it's a way that by aware handles storytelling aside from the good and evil spectrum, you know, right, right, but then they put all that together somehow."
2892.0,2900.0," Okay, I'm taking one more step back higher than Star Trek online, which is just the license MMOs in general."
2900.0,2906.0, Seem to me mostly a bad idea about what the rings.
2906.0,2909.0," Lord of the Rings, being an amazing exception."
2909.0,2912.0, I think that they did a really good job surprisingly good job.
2912.0,2925.0," What do you wouldn't just clarify though, you mean bad bad idea as a gamer who was going to enjoy playing means or bad ideas and like decreasing your chances of becoming yet another MMO that comes out and flops and inventions."
2925.0,2927.0, I would say both.
2927.0,2938.0," I, I fear here's the license is a good way to save yourself because if you're just some other random fantasy thing and you're more like orcs and stuff, but no one knows you."
2938.0,2947.0, You're more hammering you're not workcraft or if you're like tabular us has got this trouble right I mean what it has going for it is like Gary it's name but like our auto assault you're just like.
2947.0,2949.0, If it does it's not a secret.
2949.0,2951.0, But that's time time again.
2951.0,2958.0," Yeah, it's been proven that like MMOs stories are one of their biggest weaknesses because you can't convince people to care if they don't already."
2958.0,2964.0," So if you kind of have a built in like I understand this universe, I know what these characters are for I know what these planets are like."
2964.0,2966.0, I already have that story in your head.
2966.0,2973.0, So you already have a whole lot of background to enjoy it on another level that the whole brand new universe just can't.
2973.0,2974.0," Yeah, present."
2974.0,2977.0, I'd say it's a good enough decision that it explains why you see so many of them.
2977.0,2982.0, It's a safety net where a lot of I'm sure a lot of the developers of these license demos would much rather.
2982.0,2989.0, Realize their own dream that they've had in their own you know notebook for all these years but the publishers like well.
2989.0,2999.0," If you do it with Star Trek that's enough of a safety net we can at least count on like you know maybe 10,000 hardcore Star Trek fans getting into this right."
2999.0,3000.0, Of course then my.
3000.0,3006.0, You're on the other hand there you're crippled by the expectations of the fan base.
3006.0,3012.0, You can't win you can't yeah on a similar note you know they just announced that that's.
3012.0,3017.0, Darth Vader and Yoda are the unlockable character not unlockable but they're the bonus characters and soul caliber.
3017.0,3027.0, Right and it seems like to make no sense to people they're like well why for one why don't why wouldn't they use characters from other Namco games or if that's the case why wouldn't they use other.
3027.0,3035.0, You know once from like you know I'm manga or even other Japanese games like Devil May Cry but it's like this is the reason they're not putting the bonus characters in there.
3035.0,3040.0, To make the people who are having playing a soul caliber like me as long as the series has been around.
3040.0,3047.0, That much more certain that they're gonna pre order but so someone who normally would in pain he attention to it's like dude Scott Darth Vader.
3047.0,3055.0, It's been it's it has been since masters of terrorist crisis and so I've been able to fight Darth Vader and then you can get that person that maybe turn them into.
3055.0,3058.0, A soul caliber fan through it you know I think the license is.
3058.0,3061.0, So it's a comic book crossing that between nerd lands.
3061.0,3067.0, It's like please people of Star Wars nerd land come to the caliber nerd land.
3067.0,3069.0, We have characters for you.
3069.0,3070.0, It is.
3070.0,3075.0, The thing that bug me most about that was the apparent selective memory that the gaming community had like immediately.
3075.0,3080.0, I have to announce because all the tons of comments even some of the articles on some of the major blogs were like.
3080.0,3085.0, Oh man they're messing with this you know the soul caliber lore for one thing and leave it away.
3085.0,3090.0, Oh god and then people would be like what's this doesn't make any sense what the hell and then you're just like.
3090.0,3096.0, Do you remember when they put Lincoln spawn yeah just in silky laboratory like right that didn't make sense.
3096.0,3103.0, How come this is like a big deal do you remember when you you know beat the first couple of games with characters and watch the cut scenes.
3103.0,3107.0, And because you know that didn't make any sense either right.
3107.0,3108.0, No yeah.
3108.0,3109.0, Makes sense and tech.
3109.0,3111.0, So yeah.
3111.0,3119.0, Did you ever speak of of MMO's have you guys read anything about this new MTV a lower east side thing.
3119.0,3124.0, It's really interesting and it's a brand of shoes from fucking pay less dude.
3124.0,3135.0, Well no check it out check it out basically MTV is hired hired people to recreate the lower east side of Manhattan famed for its hipsters and bohemian culture and rock clubs.
3135.0,3146.0, To remake it in sort of second life form and you go online and you dress up as your particular brand of hipster and you hang out with dudes and chicks.
3146.0,3165.0, That's how hipsters talk at bars and they actually let you go into the most famed clubs in the lower side and watch bands play live you know unlike a little screen inside the club and you hang out and you know it's like you're really there except you know you're at your computer and you're underwear.
3165.0,3168.0, Are they building those in the second life or are they building it?
3168.0,3170.0, No it's like.
3170.0,3171.0, I don't know.
3171.0,3179.0, MTV has their own division of of of these virtual experiences they're making because they made that lagoon a beach in the mo game.
3179.0,3180.0, I'm like oh my god.
3180.0,3184.0, They're basically trying to get into this sort of like virtual space.
3184.0,3192.0, Is this one attached to is there a lower east side show that they have no it's like a totally to totally independent thing that they're doing.
3192.0,3196.0, There was a story about it in like Sunday before last New York Times.
3196.0,3200.0, It was pretty ridiculous sounding but at the same time kind of intriguing.
3200.0,3203.0, The conjewt dude how bummed out of it.
3203.0,3211.0, It was head he's just like in why emo is an anagram for money.
3211.0,3214.0, I just think it had just fucking weird it sounds.
3214.0,3217.0, Yeah it sounds exactly like second life actually.
3217.0,3224.0, Yeah I did that word instead of watching a video of a band play I went in and watched people of videos of video people fucking.
3224.0,3228.0, It was like the red light district.
3228.0,3235.0, Yeah isn't that all had like a point of the year yeah I got a popcorn I got like a you get free popcorn in the lobby.
3235.0,3242.0, And then I had I got some money somehow I don't know I went around begging and people gave me some money and I went into this like sex shop in there.
3242.0,3249.0, And I bought like a big ass paddle and I got like a giant bowner that I could put on my character.
3249.0,3251.0, So I what we did.
3251.0,3253.0, Just been a while.
3253.0,3266.0, I was in there under the you know it's supposed to like to research I was supposed to be in there research for a story I wrote on prostitutes in the game and we had a little fun with it too so we had.
3266.0,3275.0, I wasn't fun otherwise I got the I so I took my clothes off and got like you know like just like but naked and had the the reaction and then I was holding the.
3275.0,3285.0, I'm editing this so so like and then I had a bucket of popcorn in one arm and then like this big ass like spank paddle and the other and I'd walk around.
3285.0,3290.0, I'll just beat and then go up to like there'd be like furies and shit in there and I just start beating them.
3290.0,3301.0, And then be like be like heal you beast a you thou foul beast a burden and then like they immediately start flipping out you know like told me like I was going to get banned from the area whatever they call it.
3301.0,3305.0, The Sam or something if I didn't get my clothes on and stop beating people.
3305.0,3311.0, I didn't get it was violating their personal space and shit so then after that like we.
3312.0,3313.0, I.
3313.0,3315.0, Roll what what could possibly come back.
3315.0,3316.0, I.
3316.0,3318.0, This is why that game spawn I got to go back in there.
3318.0,3320.0, So it's boring.
3320.0,3322.0, And I was like.
3322.0,3329.0, So boring was in there with me and I was supposed to go and see what what happens you know when you go in for one of these like virtual prostitution things so.
3329.0,3338.0, I told him to like trail me you like watch my back like call the police if I don't come out right and he he somehow started entertaining himself when I was like walking around this like.
3338.0,3353.0, I'm just like prostitute hotel and he got he had his most disgusting character ever the thing in his games you want to make like really gorgeous looking characters or as far as you can make him in this very ugly game and he made the most messed up thing ever like the guy.
3353.0,3362.0, His shoulders were like for feet across but his legs were like two takes you know it is head is all about shaped and and looked like he's sculpted at a like play to buy a blind fool.
3362.0,3367.0, And so he's running around with that guy naked but he bought a um someone and there's probably into that.
3367.0,3372.0, He got like some kind of a flying scooter from so he is flying over the area.
3372.0,3378.0, So he also got he got a he found a way to replicate items so he had these like red.
3378.0,3383.0, Dildos and he's throwing these down from the sky and raining them all over.
3383.0,3384.0, He's nuts.
3384.0,3386.0, It's nuts.
3386.0,3387.0, It's nuts.
3387.0,3388.0, It's not.
3388.0,3389.0, So all the check this out.
3389.0,3396.0, So it's been really throwing so many of these down that it's lagging the entire world because like it's the game is meant to run on like low rent physics.
3396.0,3399.0, But every time this thing falls from the sky it's got to seem like the physics of it.
3399.0,3406.0, So by basically creating a thunderstorm red Dildos it's like it's lagging it for everyone in their game.
3406.0,3417.0, I mean while I'm in the room with this chicken you know she's like telling me you know how it works and you know pulling up she her character will hold up a picture frame and it'll be like a real picture or something.
3417.0,3418.0, Of something.
3418.0,3419.0, I ain't gonna say what that's something.
3420.0,3421.0, Meaning an actual photo.
3421.0,3422.0, Yeah.
3422.0,3426.0, And then what crosses the line you want to tell us what was in the picture.
3426.0,3429.0, You'll tell us what's in the thunderstorm red Dildos.
3431.0,3434.0, And that's how Royale's on has some propriety.
3434.0,3440.0, I was like oh shit get in here because she told me she's like you know make your character lay down on the bed and I was like dude Roy give me adding here.
3440.0,3445.0, So he comes out like he comes charging up his stairs and it's supposed to be like a locked door.
3445.0,3449.0, But he figured out you could just walk right through it because it's not actually locked.
3449.0,3453.0, Everyone's just got to play along with the fiction right like oh it's it's locked.
3453.0,3457.0, So I won't go in and he just like faces right through the door and all of his like.
3457.0,3459.0, Just retarded disgusting glory.
3459.0,3463.0, If he comes in and walks up to the prostitute goes looking to my eyes when he do that.
3463.0,3466.0, He's like I'm sorry.
3466.0,3471.0, I don't know who this is.
3471.0,3477.0, Could you please get out and she kept telling the leave because she couldn't see us talk weird and like ventriloge.
3477.0,3479.0, You didn't know that you guys knew each other.
3479.0,3485.0," Yeah, so I kept telling them to bar gin and she's like okay let's go to the penthouse and it's like something to the sky elevator and it takes you up to this."
3485.0,3491.0, This you know this penthouse in the sky and she's like you wait at the elevator and all buzz you in and it's like.
3491.0,3496.0, You know it's kind of the equivalent of simulates real life where you're like when this light turns green hit it and get in the elevator come up.
3496.0,3502.0, But so I would tell Roy of course are you up and get over here come up with me and then like you so we come up and she'd be like oh god.
3502.0,3504.0, He's back.
3504.0,3508.0, She came out into the world and he walk his way back to the elevator again.
3508.0,3513.0, It's kind of like a shitty platform where you know when you get to the very top and you fall off you got to go back up.
3513.0,3520.0, So then I would run over the door and whoa what's this and I actually hit the wrong button but of course I was buzzing them back up to come back up in the room.
3520.0,3523.0," Yeah, you can have fun in in some life."
3523.0,3525.0, William Gibson predicted all of this.
3525.0,3531.0, That was something that earlier. It is very neuro-mancer like I was also thinking when you first started talking the story that
3531.0,3534.0, Here's a game that calls itself second life.
3534.0,3542.0, So you can create yourself online and watch Shawn just do it with his second life.
3542.0,3545.0, Will be this like naked homeless.
3545.0,3547.0, Born out with tending.
3547.0,3550.0, What what what what hand with popcorn.
3550.0,3552.0, What's the popcorn?
3552.0,3553.0," Oh, I can't."
3553.0,3555.0, It's because it made him look just like so chill.
3555.0,3560.0, Like you weren't there to look at him but it indicated that I was the one doing here.
3560.0,3561.0," You were like, yeah."
3561.0,3563.0, Like don't look at me like I'm watching you fools.
3563.0,3566.0, And now and then I'll beat you with this like second life.
3566.0,3568.0, Who would be good stick.
3568.0,3570.0, But she made like a cracking sound.
3570.0,3575.0, I can get a lot of attention though and I don't know if it has does it actually have the subscriber based.
3575.0,3576.0, It's good.
3576.0,3577.0, I can't.
3577.0,3580.0, I think Kong and a game is probably like they will tell you this.
3580.0,3581.0, It's not a game.
3581.0,3582.0, That's a game.
3582.0,3583.0, That's a game.
3583.0,3584.0, I don't know what's that.
3584.0,3590.0, There's a whole another discussion there with what we used to sort of indicate what's a game.
3590.0,3593.0, What's the game and like what Robert did I did I lend you the book?
3593.0,3595.0, This is your brain on music.
3595.0,3596.0, No the music.
3596.0,3597.0, I can't use music.
3597.0,3598.0," Yeah, okay."
3598.0,3602.0, So a case that you know that I marked the page and I was like actually this.
3602.0,3609.0, I'm translating this into video game language and it's that you know when you you get into the same problem where you say is this
3609.0,3624.0, or is this a jazz or is this type of music and then and then when you go and you try to define what all the necessary you know pre conditions are for actually being jazz or being like heavy metal or something.
3624.0,3631.0, You look in every single time you find things that people would put in that group that don't meet one or more of the conditions.
3631.0,3632.0, Yeah.
3632.0,3637.0, And so the whole case he was making it was kind of like it's really just it's not even a fuzzy logic.
3637.0,3641.0, It's just this really abstract thing where we group certain cases like that and I feel the same way about games.
3641.0,3642.0, I mean it is a game to me.
3642.0,3644.0," Yeah, actually it's not for my name."
3644.0,3652.0," Yeah, maybe it's not related but it kind of is involving music and the band the minute man in the 80s where this kind of punk."
3652.0,3655.0, Funk trio.
3655.0,3666.0, They were just an amazing amazing collection of musicians and they came up in the in the days of black flag and meet up at some and all of them and they were they were part of that group of LA musicians.
3666.0,3679.0, But they're sound in their style was so different than the hardcore punk bands at the time even though people outside of the punk scene labeled them as punk and you would stocks you find the records on the punk.
3679.0,3681.0, With a punk label today.
3681.0,3687.0, Punk's at the time dismissed them because they were they had like too much funk in their sound.
3687.0,3694.0," Yeah, you know the bass was was very funky and dance like and Mike what the bass player in a recent interview."
3694.0,3707.0," He was telling the story about how they were at a club in Los Angeles, a punk club and some punk came up to them and said you know you fucking guys you know you're not punk you sound totally different."
3707.0,3712.0, And their response was isn't that the whole point of punk.
3712.0,3714.0, It's different like that.
3714.0,3723.0, Punk's have always been the total pureton assholes about everything puretanical and like everything that they do you know you have to have the right haircut.
3723.0,3731.0, You have to listen to the right music dictated by you know what they're just aggressive and I think preserving we are all non-conformas.
3731.0,3732.0, So to get there.
3732.0,3735.0," Yeah, a legend you know this of the identity package."
3735.0,3739.0, But I suppose you could translate that reasonably into games and gamers too.
3739.0,3740.0," Yeah, that's all."
3740.0,3743.0, I think gamers are usually fairly open to.
3743.0,3744.0," Okay, never mind."
3744.0,3746.0," I mean, stop it on the internet there."
3747.0,3748.0, Right there.
3748.0,3749.0, The conditions.
3749.0,3754.0," I mean, you could fill in if you're like, well, a game has to be something with a goal and you have to be able to complete it."
3754.0,3759.0," Okay, so I guess that means I'm not playing a game when I'm playing battlefield or something."
3759.0,3767.0, Or if I'm playing something or another kind of game where like I'm not going to complete it in any real sense you know or.
3767.0,3774.0," But I mean, when you look at the range of games between say like a bio shock and then peggle or something."
3774.0,3778.0," I mean, the category is so broad that it can fit everything in between there."
3778.0,3784.0, I don't I think it's ultimately the sense for me it finds a game is like if you're.
3784.0,3786.0, Controlling what's happening on your case.
3786.0,3787.0, If you're king in any way.
3787.0,3788.0," Yeah, yeah, then it's a game."
3788.0,3789.0, Exactly.
3789.0,3790.0, Yeah.
3790.0,3792.0, It's more like just interactive like digital media.
3792.0,3797.0, The whole fight ever like just not the non games and games is kind of kind of weird and silly.
3797.0,3803.0, People seem to think that the non games are taking over or that's what they thought a year ago until they realize that it's just.
3803.0,3812.0, There's just a bunch of like housewives buying a we sports and playing it for two weeks and then going back to watching all my children.
3812.0,3815.0," Yeah, but yeah, huh."
3815.0,3822.0," You know, the whole like there was this big fear among hardcore gamers for like the last year because there's still a still here it."
3822.0,3824.0, I find that argument idiotic.
3824.0,3830.0," Yeah, I mean, especially right in a year that had so many really hard core games that were awesome come out."
3830.0,3832.0, It's kind of crazy and silly.
3832.0,3835.0," There's still a frame of punk to be afraid of all over again, right?"
3835.0,3845.0," You know, and if it's like you have to be a certain kind of game, you have to be the legend of Zelda or if you're not you're like like that should's not pontoon get out of here with that."
3845.0,3855.0," Yeah, it gets I mean, there's there's room for all of these things not much rather have the options to play them all rather than just play it all starts with one can people who."
3855.0,3860.0," Put themselves into a category like if it's not a turn based text game, it's not a game right."
3860.0,3875.0," But one thing you asked it was about like if anyone plays second life and it seems kind of weird to me that it's been just an incredible success on the PR front to the point that like when you listen to NPR talk at the nation, they have people right."
3875.0,3895.0," And people that are like in second life giving them questions, you have all these famous and it's kind of like been another way to get publicity because it's like say if you're bought or whatever you're like, oh, I'm going to make an appearance in second life and all it really amounts to is you have like some duty in your on garage sit on the computer for a minute and make this character move around and say yeah, yeah."
3895.0,3909.0," And then all of a sudden you get your name in like five papers and on you know on websites and stuff and it's kind of been used for that, but I don't think the community of people that actually go in every day and really play like the ones that I did me like the prostitutes and stuff."
3909.0,3922.0," I mean, they all it was that was like people that really knew each other they like they see each other in the game every day they have all these assumptions they actually know a lot about their their real lives outside of the game."
3922.0,3927.0, But it is for people like that is the game a game or it's like that there is this.
3927.0,3946.0, It's his there it's a game but also you know you know we were talking about when you're talking about role playing games earlier and about how whether you know for you you weren't defining puzzle quest as an RPG right and it was interesting listening because I was like well what do you even what do you actually define.
3946.0,3955.0," And a role playing game as because like in my point of view the kind of things that you were describing aren't really role playing to me, but they're just sort of action games."
3955.0,3965.0," And I always look at things like Final Fantasy and stuff and even World Warcraft if you're not in a role playing server is not role playing games, but sort of like level builder."
3965.0,3969.0," Yes, I mean and it's a common argument actually the role playing."
3969.0,3973.0," Yes, sub community too. And so these people are actually really playing roles right I mean."
3973.0,3982.0, Absolutely they say this is my name and this is what this person's about and there right you know it maybe it's another gender whoever you know whatever the case may be.
3982.0,3987.0, I think like when Robert's coffee is from her here was a lap dancer in the Star Wars galaxies.
3987.0,3992.0," Yeah, and it was role playing was talking about his clients while we were trying to eat lunch."
3992.0,3996.0, I got to get back I got to get back to a couple of my clients are waiting for me.
3996.0,4000.0, Dude indoor voice.
4000.0,4009.0, I do I do think that a second life gets a lot of that press that because I think the idea of a virtual world is really powerful to people who don't play games and I think that.
4009.0,4023.0, In a lot of ways the you know the legitimate gaming folks have given up on the idea because it seems so far fetched to anyone who spends time playing games it's like a whole year virtual world where like you know 20 years away from that.
4023.0,4038.0, And and now we're so like hooked on the various genres the first person shooters and the RPG using all that stuff that I don't know if we get the the appeal of the idea of you know a completely fictional place that is built from the ground up to be a kind of fantasy.
4038.0,4062.0, You know and I'd be down with that I don't know if I'd be interested in the lower east side or second life but right but there is a second life is theoretically the skies the limit you know you can there there are there are parts of the world where it might be like nothing but furry town and it's all themes with furries and stuff like that there would be another that's like mad scientist right so it's people on.
4062.0,4073.0, Crazy you know rocket ships living in space houses and stuff and that's it you can make whatever you want you can sell what you make you buy real estate you can get with the group of people and say.
4073.0,4074.0, Let's buy this.
4074.0,4088.0, Track the land and make our own little rapture something our own little objective is you know just hope you over here but the problem is that the game looks like ass and it runs like ass so it's like while that potential's there.
4088.0,4097.0, And there's so much fun I mean there are there for a grief or it's like oh dude there's so many things you can do and the cases that are classic where like some of the guys from something awful.
4097.0,4114.0, Almost destroyed the entire game by creating a self replicating bouncing ball and again here's where physics coming to play is at the ball every time a bounce is the game's got to calculate that but every time it would bounce it would split into two and there you have exponential you know replication where.
4114.0,4119.0, You know 20 bounces got notice how many many bouncing balls you have and what happened is that.
4119.0,4129.0, It would crush the hub and it was spreading like a virus throughout the entire world covering you see it was like arm again through bouncing balls and like some.
4129.0,4132.0, They had to go in and create fire walls by.
4132.0,4141.0, Like by shutting down because I guess the way that the servers are connected by shutting down all the adjacent worlds and the contained the bouncing ball thing to prevent it from.
4141.0,4144.0, Yeah like a curve on a get to an ice nine type thing.
4144.0,4145.0, Yeah yeah.
4145.0,4154.0, And so that's classic griefing and then there's the other like you know they had a famous you know person making a appearance of original parents and there and then they they rigged it up instead of a bunch of.
4154.0,4157.0, Giant wing faluses would fly by through the entire.
4157.0,4161.0, Remember that speech right there's some red videos of that up.
4161.0,4168.0, How do they how do they do that when when when the famous people stood up to second life how do they make sure that something totally embarrassing doesn't happen it seems so.
4168.0,4171.0, They watch it get ready to ban immediately.
4171.0,4177.0," Yes and it's something happens, but there are clever people that find ways around to they can brief all the same."
4177.0,4186.0, Can we move to second life and like world of work after an alegas to like moshes versus muds could I used to play muds back in the day you know completely text based.
4186.0,4191.0, Wait that's a little bit more multi user dungeon and multi user.
4191.0,4193.0, Oh crap. I forget my mush.
4193.0,4197.0, That's a sage. It was basically the same thing though is like the muds would be the very.
4197.0,4205.0, Stat heavy or we want you go north there's a monster here you're fighting with some other people against the monster and you've like our class and you would get levels but then the mushes were.
4205.0,4210.0, There's other thing they were kind of tangentially related but the lot of it was user created rooms.
4210.0,4214.0, There was no like stats but people were still playing roles in them so you would go.
4214.0,4226.0, North and you would enter a room that had been made by someone where you know whatever the rule is it's like you have been transformed into a fairy and now you can only speak in poems and then people would if if they were into mushes they would do that.
4226.0,4232.0, And to me like second life and world of work after just that with graphics now.
4232.0,4243.0, You see the extra there's like a small less intense version of that appeal that you see everywhere like I mean if you're in a team fortress to server and everyone's like come on don't kill each other and then everyone spends the time.
4243.0,4250.0, Messing around or doing whatever if they're playing Halo 3 and 4 each and they're like let's create a scene from Mario Brothers or something.
4250.0,4258.0, Battlefield like let's just do stunts and make videos of that you know so there's always this low level interest where people want to go and.
4258.0,4269.0, And maybe that is part of the problem with second life is that since that's the norm there I think some of the allure and doing that and these other games I mentioned is that because you you're aware that you're doing what you're not supposed to be.
4269.0,4274.0, Right and that you feel like maybe it's more creative to find a way to.
4274.0,4286.0, To make your own version of a game in a game that was meant for something else entirely then they go in going then then they're equivalent of second life which is like your mom giving you some paper and crayon and telling you to sure draw something.
4286.0,4287.0, Mm-hmm.
4287.0,4288.0, Right.
4288.0,4294.0," Yeah, if you're if you're indicating your mom says well you go on out till you can come on with tonic lock at night."
4294.0,4296.0, You know party is going to go.
4296.0,4300.0, Shit now that I'm allowed to I kind of just want to stay home.
4300.0,4307.0, But if you if they're like stay in your room don't go anywhere and you sneak out and then you can fuck around then you're gonna have a great time.
4307.0,4318.0, That that would explain like the extreme forms like you know boundary pushing like the kind of shit that we're doing where in the game where the people that are the real geniuses that made the ice nine episode.
4319.0,4322.0," So it's like if your mom tells you you could do something well, that's fine."
4322.0,4331.0, Some way to give her like like the genie's wish you know like she's you know where you are the genie grants your wish you got to be careful about the exact wording.
4331.0,4332.0, I think you're just more.
4332.0,4333.0, Yeah.
4333.0,4334.0, Yes.
4334.0,4335.0, So like that.
4335.0,4337.0," Yeah, so they tell you go ahead and do something to have fun."
4337.0,4339.0, Or like all right.
4339.0,4340.0, All right then.
4340.0,4342.0, Like do a little rain.
4342.0,4345.0, She's your umbrella out.
4346.0,4349.0, Well kind of umbrella protects from the rain of Dildes by the way.
4349.0,4350.0, Rubber sheet.
4350.0,4351.0, I don't know.
4351.0,4354.0, That sounds like a reader question.
4354.0,4355.0, Yeah.
4355.0,4356.0, If anyone knows the answer.
4356.0,4357.0, Right.
4357.0,4359.0, So do you have to be letters that's effective.

4365.0,4367.0, Well actually maybe we should take our break.
4367.0,4368.0," But yeah, well yeah."
4368.0,4371.0, We'll take a break and we'll come back with a more serious note.

4428.0,4433.0," And EGM about how a few companies, you know, Ubisoft."
4433.0,4439.0," It was one of them are not giving those of us in the Zifdebes game group any access to their games,"
4439.0,4445.0," which which means like, you know, we're not allowed to go to the events that they hold the press events that they hold."
4445.0,4448.0, We won't get copies of.
4448.0,4455.0," Of games to review and advance so that our reviews will be timely, you know, preview code, not going to ever be able to interview anyone involved with the companies."
4456.0,4462.0," And the announcement I think it was it was interesting, but mainly frustrating to see the reactions to it."
4462.0,4470.0," And I don't know if it was because if we didn't did a good enough job of explaining why anyone should care, why it matters to anyone other than us."
4470.0,4474.0," And so on this note, the first thing is that."
4474.0,4477.0, It's their right of course to do this.
4477.0,4484.0," I mean, there's no it's it's not like our God given right to get advance and access to the games that a publisher's producer."
4484.0,4488.0, The publisher's producing art of be able to speak to the people that are making it or anything like that.
4488.0,4493.0," And so it's like, yeah, we're not crying about that at all. They could do it."
4493.0,4496.0, But the reasons for it are what are troubling.
4496.0,4506.0," And you know, she'll mention that there's negative reaction, you know, on that publisher's part two, the review scores that that won up an e-games game,"
4506.0,4511.0," a Assassin's Creed and that, you know, alluded to that maybe that there are some other things that they weren't so happy with."
4511.0,4521.0," But the problem here in the reason now, I just wanted to address it because I couldn't stand to sit there and look at that and see people for the people that reacted to it like, oh, who cares?"
4521.0,4530.0," This is news because why, you know, that response you see it's like people have it like control seed ready to control via every time they see it thread like this."
4530.0,4531.0, Yeah.
4531.0,4545.0," It's because if you for one, if you know, you should be concerned if you know that a publisher is only going to give access to, you know, press outlets that their convinced are going to give them"
4545.0,4552.0," coverage that they're happy with, you know, that it's a stance to reason is fairly flattering."
4552.0,4560.0," It's going to be good for there. There are review scores and things like this. I mean on that level, it doesn't necessarily mean it's not like us saying, hey,"
4560.0,4566.0, because we're the only ones who've been blacklisted. It means everyone else is is up to no good and that's not the point at all.
4566.0,4571.0," But the very fact that they did it does put that suspicion out there, which one isn't good."
4571.0,4578.0," And it also could create, I mean hypothetically, it could create scenarios where say you're an editor at another website."
4578.0,4586.0," And you're like, wow, I heard about that, or I know that Ubisoft is this is a possible course of action for them."
4586.0,4592.0," I don't want that to happen to us. Like, let's be careful. Don't maybe this is your going a little too far. Can you be a little nicer?"
4592.0,4602.0," I mean, it creates a pressure in that direction. And we, I mean, it this is all another way of looking at what just came up. You know, again, it wasn't verified, but with the game spot thing in Jeff Gersman's firing over there."
4602.0,4613.0," And and the reasons that people were, you know, some people were alleging that he was let go because didn't wasn't kind enough to a certain publishers game, you know."
4614.0,4625.0," So, I mean, that that's bad right there. You get the scenario where you think on the extreme benefits, like, well, for really nice them, maybe we can get the first look at it. We guarantee that we get the extreme access."
4625.0,4633.0, And the reason they want that is because if you're the first one to put something up and you can brag about it and all that then you're going to get more hits and it's good good business for you.
4633.0,4642.0," Mm-hmm. So, yeah, this is not the first time obviously at all that this kind of thing has happened with between a publisher and"
4642.0,4660.0," a publisher and if Davis and I'm sure some of the other publishers as well, I don't know because I didn't work for them, but certainly in my time it has if Davis has been probably almost every major publisher I could think of at one time or another has pulled their advertising from this company in response to a"
4660.0,4670.0, negative review or what they felt was unfair coverage or whatever it is. But what about entirely denying you access to any coverage though.
4670.0,4675.0," This is that's the first, that's the first sense since I've been here. Okay. That, that I've seen that happen."
4675.0,4684.0," Or yeah, they just said, yeah, you know what, you can't come to game demos anymore. We're not going to give you screenshots, you know, fuck you basically. I've never seen that happen."
4684.0,4704.0," So this is an extreme version of that and I think maybe there, I mean, it wasn't just to me that it did not have the same sort of impact at all remotely as the Gershman think did just sort of got announced a lot of people did like you said kind of this, you know say that one up and and you had it coming to them or whatever."
4704.0,4706.0," Yeah, those are the best ones."
4706.0,4717.0," But I think the difference here too is that is obviously that this was the game company doing what you said at the very getting, which is that they have a right to do this if that's what they want to do."
4717.0,4727.0," And if just saying, I mean, what can we do other than go like, okay, great. Well, fuck you too. But rather, but, but rather, but cave though, and like, I mean,"
4727.0,4744.0," Ziff is essentially given us the backing and said, look, we're not in rather than they could have come to it. That's the nice right right the difference is not that that our bosses who are are Simon Cox and Dan Chu, you know, neither one of them went to the person who reviewed Assassin's Creed negatively and said,"
4744.0,4754.0," you know, you need to be nicer here and apologize to Ubisoft and then fired that reviewer, which is which is analogous to what happened to Gershman, right?"
4754.0,4757.0," Or what's the legit, but allegedly happened to Gershman."
4757.0,4773.0," So yeah, we had the backings of our of our bosses here on this. That doesn't make it less news that in fact, we have been banned from covering, in GFW's case it's really just Ubisoft, right?"
4773.0,4777.0," Yeah, because the other side applied to us."
4777.0,4792.0," I just think it says bad, you know, doesn't, doesn't shine a very positive light on the way that Ubisoft or a lot of other publishers treat their customers, treat the people who play their games."
4792.0,4812.0," It's like, you know, if we can't properly manipulate the image that you're going to read about the impression that you're going to get from a game when you read about it and then the pendant press out left and we're not interested, you know, we're not interested in playing it straight with you or"
4812.0,4817.0," letting honest opinions, you know, follow as they might, you know."
4817.0,4839.0," Well, I think it's partially the immaturity of the game industry in general, you know, that it hasn't grown up enough to be able to kind of lead its products, stand on its own without, without feeling the need to have it, you know, this constant, you know,"
4839.0,4847.0," what I'm saying is that they need, they believe that we need to be cheerleaders for the industry rather than independent media voice."
4847.0,4858.0," If we're not playing along in that game and supporting them, then we are not doing our job in their eyes, which to me is just a dead wrong assessment of what our role is supposed to be."
4858.0,4863.0," But, but I think they feel that we are failing in, in that role."
4863.0,4874.0," Yeah, you can see how, like, maybe if they're, like, well, you know, they, they, we're not so confident about this game or whatever, however the case may be, if they think that for some reason,"
4874.0,4892.0," we're not going to say the things they would like to see us say, they could say, well, let's not give them the cover story or something, but to go so far as to be like, we're having a press event and everyone's invited to the fact, like, if you've got, if you just made your own fan site and you've got 200 clicks in the past month, you get to go and everyone gets to go."
4892.0,4906.0," But these guys can't go. We're not going to let you in the door. Then, I mean, that seems especially petty, but also back to that point of like the most frustrating for me is that it, it makes, it should make people that much more suspicion."
4906.0,4915.0," And I don't want this to be the case, but it should make people that much more suspicious about the kind things are said, and it works the other way too, where it's like, well, we do belatedly get around to covering this stuff."
4915.0,4927.0," People are going to be like, oh, well, let's see how pissed off they are. And this is our chance to strike back, which is not in case because no one here is going to like let that influence your take on that would be that would be right."
4927.0,4931.0, That would be as immature and unprofessional as the way they're acting.
4931.0,4947.0," The environment will, I think that this creates sort of puts that suspicion out there in the same way that I think it should make some people that it will make some people suspicious when they see like, oh, here's a 10 and this is the first review that went up for this game, you know."
4947.0,4962.0," I think the most frustrating thing for me is, you know, I'm always writing stories that seem to be all about contacting a lot of different developers and getting their views on things I'm interested in the creative process behind games."
4962.0,4970.0," And I'm working on series like that right now and I'm looking through my game shelf thinking of, oh, who would be good to talk to about this stuff."
4970.0,4987.0," And I see so many games now that I'm like, oh, well, I guess, you know, I can't talk to the people who made that game right, you know, and that's that's just strange like, you know, why it just to not being not be able to to do that because of something so commercial and petty and stupid."
4987.0,4991.0, But I know the story you're talking about and then the frustration. Yeah.
4991.0,5001.0," It's totally there. Yeah. I mean, there's there's nothing to, uh, there's nothing we could do about it on our end."
5001.0,5014.0," I could bet what we could do about is when we do we can we can assure, you know, our readers and make an extra point of myself, so when we do cover their games that we are not letting this factor in to the way that we're looking at these games."
5014.0,5027.0," Now, of course, that was part of the thing too. A lot of people are like accusing Chris Ben, which is Chris from Boyer, EGM, this one of the reviewers of Assassin's Creed of all these things about trying to make a name for himself by giving it a lower view."
5027.0,5033.0," And that it's like, hey, I can't blame people for not knowing what I do just because I know him."
5033.0,5041.0," It's like how long he's been in the industry and how like little he cares about making a name, so called name for himself."
5041.0,5051.0," And like, and then also that about seeing him every day playing that game and seeing him screaming and yelling and getting like genuinely pissed off playing it doesn't mean it's not going to be that way for everyone."
5051.0,5058.0," Keep saying, it was really one of those divisive games, you know, I still care about loving it. I need to get a copy of it."
5058.0,5064.0," But I mean, yeah, I can for his part, I know for a fact that he wasn't trying to not like it."
5064.0,5066.0, It just didn't like it.
5066.0,5077.0," And I think this sort of thing's going to happen, not the blackballing, but the sort of mixed reaction in the extreme will happen more and more as games go on in the same way they happen with movies."
5077.0,5095.0," You never see, you know, these freakouts with movies that come out and you know, you have one critic who loves it and thinks it's one of the best movies of the year and another critic who thinks, you know, that it's totally pompous and and didn't connect with it emotionally and thought that the characters were, you know, totally off and blah blah."
5095.0,5106.0," You know, it's just it gets to that point after a while we've been evaluating games as these sort of production for their production values for so long because it took, you know, however many years just to get people to make a game."
5106.0,5112.0, That didn't look like shit and played halfway as well as in like an Nintendo game.
5112.0,5116.0, I like this theory when I heard it before.
5116.0,5117.0, Yeah.
5117.0,5124.0," And the thing and I, I mean, I really bought into it, you know, and I'm, which of course, saying this in the past tense means I change my mind."
5124.0,5135.0," And that's just because like, as much as I want to see that, I think now I'm actually seeing the film industry revert because of the presence of the internet and then the prominence of sites like, you know,"
5135.0,5142.0, and it cool that news and stuff like that and then now all these quotes when you see like the tags on the movies and the posters.
5142.0,5154.0, Remember we're over having like dinner or some beers that one night and there was that poster in the video place right next door and I pointed out to Sarah and it was like the line was it could have come from the worst video game review ever.
5154.0,5164.0," So the, the movie reviews are drawing on those kind of critics more and more and I've heard stories of where like the big ones will not be invited to the early review screenings."
5164.0,5174.0," But of course, they're doing the same thing and they're scooping up all the hairy nose, you know, and heard them into the theaters that they come out with like that whole like what did you think it was to feel good movie."
5174.0,5177.0," So I'm not, I just read it."
5177.0,5179.0, I read it.
5179.0,5181.0, It was realistic.
5181.0,5182.0, I read it.
5182.0,5183.0, I read it.
5183.0,5184.0, I read it.
5184.0,5185.0, I read it.
5185.0,5186.0, I read it.
5186.0,5187.0, I read it.
5187.0,5188.0, I read it.
5188.0,5189.0, I read it.
5189.0,5190.0, I read it.
5190.0,5191.0, I read it.
5191.0,5192.0, I read it.
5192.0,5193.0, I read it.
5193.0,5194.0, So I read it.
5194.0,5197.0," Yeah, it's an angry real."
5197.0,5200.0, Many people said it was so.
5200.0,5202.0, There are huge businesses that are moving and foremost they get the exact information
5202.0,5204.0, Do they experience the following food.
5209.0,5213.0,ublic manufacturing.
5213.0,5215.0, And there.
5215.0,5218.0," So we and start up seeing the magazine, or whatever that rejects ideas but"
5218.0,5220.4," it comes out and then you can have, you know,"
5220.4,5221.44," even if you don't,"
5221.44,5223.4, even if your favorite critic doesn't get invited
5223.4,5225.92," to the screening, you can read the review,"
5225.92,5227.4," you know, day or two late."
5227.4,5229.24," But with games, it's like so crazy."
5229.24,5231.36," You know, we wanted,"
5231.36,5233.84, gamers always want like as much information as possible
5233.84,5235.36," and I can, I can, I can,"
5235.36,5237.52, I can definitely understand that.
5237.52,5241.12, I always am hungry to hear about what's coming out
5241.12,5242.96, but sometimes that comes at a cost
5242.96,5244.48," and I think that we have to,"
5244.48,5247.52," you know, narrow down the window"
5247.52,5249.88, for when we want to start hearing about this stuff
5249.88,5252.080000000001," because otherwise you're just reading advertisements,"
5252.080000000001,5252.72," you know,"
5252.72,5256.240000000001," so anyway, here, here, here, here, here, here."
5256.240000000001,5260.6," Yeah, I mean, I just wish at this point in time"
5260.6,5262.64, that the publishers could just kind of take it
5262.64,5264.4400000000005," a little better, you know,"
5264.4400000000005,5267.0, could just kind of take what we try to have
5267.0,5269.6, be constructive criticism for the most part
5269.6,5271.76, unless the game is like such a complete piece
5271.76,5273.92, of shit that all we're doing is really killing it.
5273.92,5275.72," Usually that's not what's happening,"
5275.8,5279.64," you know, in Christmas review of Assassin's Creed,"
5279.64,5282.280000000001," you know, he said specifically what he didn't like about it"
5282.280000000001,5285.52, and I thought he said it in a non-findictive way.
5285.52,5286.76," You know, it didn't seem like anything"
5286.76,5289.12, that any reasonable person could read
5289.12,5291.240000000001, and of course you're not going to be happy
5291.240000000001,5292.64, if your game gets ripped.
5292.64,5294.76," Right, but to have that kind of reaction"
5294.76,5298.0, that I'm taking my ball and going home reaction.
5298.0,5300.6," At this point in 2008 here, it's just like,"
5300.6,5301.4400000000005, come on already.
5301.4400000000005,5302.56, This is the kind of stuff that happens
5302.56,5304.52," when times is hard, you know?"
5304.6,5305.52, Sure.
5305.52,5307.4800000000005, That was that was an expensive game
5307.4800000000005,5309.160000000001, and games are really expensive.
5309.160000000001,5310.320000000001," Yeah, they're getting more expensive."
5310.320000000001,5312.88, And more and more rides on a single release
5312.88,5315.040000000001, for maybe the publisher of these two.
5315.040000000001,5317.280000000001," And I think even the audience that was reacting to that,"
5317.280000000001,5319.200000000001," I mean, I felt like I read so many comments online"
5319.200000000001,5320.84," about Assassin's Creed that was like,"
5320.84,5324.160000000001, a 4.5 is just not possible
5324.160000000001,5327.88," because you know, the production values of this game"
5327.88,5329.4800000000005, are so high quality.
5329.4800000000005,5331.72," You know, you keep, there's no way you can give this a 4.5."
5331.72,5334.320000000001," It's like, well, okay, so it's really,"
5335.28,5336.5599999999995," well, moneyed."
5336.5599999999995,5337.679999999999," It's like, it's polished."
5337.679999999999,5338.799999999999," Right, it's got great, you know?"
5338.799999999999,5340.759999999999, And some people fight over whether or not it's a great game.
5340.759999999999,5341.96," That's, that's their own thing."
5341.96,5342.799999999999, Right.
5342.799999999999,5344.92," It's not like having a game that, you know, runs well"
5344.92,5347.5199999999995," and looks good, automatically gives you some certain score"
5347.5199999999995,5349.759999999999, to which you like Michael Bay gets a lot of money
5349.759999999999,5351.599999999999," to make movies, but yeah, nobody is like,"
5351.599999999999,5353.5599999999995," hey, that's a really big budget movie."
5353.5599999999995,5354.4, Four stars.
5354.4,5355.4, Don't shit on that.
5357.4,5358.5599999999995, We're not there.
5358.5599999999995,5359.4, We're not there.
5359.4,5360.24, We're not there.
5360.24,5361.08," Maybe someday, maybe."
5361.08,5362.44, Are we really reverting?
5362.44,5364.08, What's going on?
5364.08,5365.24, It's a lot of confused.
5365.24,5366.76, I think it's reverting.
5366.76,5368.28, I don't think we're ever going to get there.
5368.28,5369.32, I think it's because you're getting old
5369.32,5370.84, and you think the world's coming with you.
5370.84,5372.16, I think that one is.
5372.16,5373.16, That's what it is.
5373.16,5375.6," And I can be an optimist about things,"
5375.6,5376.8, but I don't know.
5376.8,5379.72," I mean, I see with the, just with increased prevalence"
5379.72,5383.32," of, you know, just fan sites and things like that."
5383.32,5386.04," And so many, well, when you look at these threads, you know,"
5386.04,5387.72, when you look at these very threads and you see more
5387.72,5390.2," and more people, just the way that they read it,"
5390.2,5391.6, just strikes you as so bizarre.
5391.6,5393.28," Well, like the assumption is immediately,"
5393.28,5396.759999999999," well, the bigger you are, the shadier you have to be"
5396.759999999999,5399.639999999999," and that the smaller you are, that this must mean"
5399.639999999999,5401.599999999999, the more legit you are.
5401.599999999999,5405.4," And I mean, I see actually, it takes the backing"
5405.4,5407.88," of like a big company to give you,"
5407.88,5411.8, to buy you the freedom to say what you mean
5411.8,5413.32, and get away with it and come back
5413.32,5415.36, and to live another day and do it again.
5415.36,5417.16," Whereas they can, they'll blow your head"
5417.16,5419.24, out of the water if you're a small fry and you do that.
5419.24,5420.24," Yeah, you know."
5420.24,5421.08, Yeah.
5421.08,5421.92, Yeah.
5421.92,5425.32," I can only hope that, you know, the creative types"
5425.32,5430.32," at the great developers that are making really good games,"
5430.32,5433.2," will eventually get up, fed up with the idea of having"
5433.2,5437.6," paid for course to cheer leaders and not, you know,"
5437.6,5440.36, stand for what the marketing side of these companies
5440.36,5442.64, is doing with their products.
5442.64,5443.4800000000005, Yeah.
5443.4800000000005,5445.4800000000005," Maybe also the other thing,"
5445.4800000000005,5447.84," and this imaginary future,"
5447.84,5450.76, we're more and more games are free to play and you just
5451.72,5453.76, you pay for them by looking at the ads and stuff
5453.76,5455.2, associated with them.
5455.2,5456.04, Yeah.
5456.04,5456.96, And then it'll die down a bit too.
5456.96,5458.56," I mean, a lot of people, little bit of things"
5458.56,5459.400000000001, you would happen to them.
5459.400000000001,5460.72, They want to want to review them.
5460.72,5462.4400000000005," They'll just assume, because they're so used to"
5462.4400000000005,5465.04," reviewing products, you know, that immediately,"
5465.04,5466.4800000000005," as soon as you put someone in, can you,"
5466.4800000000005,5468.2, you can't review it network TV show.
5468.2,5470.0," I mean, yeah, no, or TV show."
5470.0,5471.0, It's free.
5471.0,5471.84, Yeah.
5471.84,5472.84, Yeah.
5472.84,5474.8, I'm kind of believing again.
5474.8,5476.76," At last week, I was hanging to our next cover story"
5476.76,5478.4800000000005," and I had to bring it up again, because like the whole"
5478.48,5481.32," theme is on my mind lately, and the PR person told me,"
5481.32,5483.759999999999," it's like, yeah, no one, we're already giving, you know,"
5483.759999999999,5486.4, the people we were that we did give like an author record
5486.4,5488.5599999999995," heads up to, we're like, yeah, we're not going to review it."
5488.5599999999995,5489.5599999999995, Wow.
5489.5599999999995,5491.16," And I was like, that's not."
5491.16,5493.16," I told him I was like, we're going to review it."
5493.16,5494.16, You're right there.
5494.16,5495.16," Like, we're your view game."
5495.16,5496.48, It's not your price tag.
5496.48,5497.48, Yeah.
5497.48,5498.48, Yeah.
5498.48,5500.24, So that'll be soon.
5500.24,5502.5599999999995," Keep teasing that, but it should be like a couple of weeks."
5502.5599999999995,5504.36," And then that, that'll be out of the bag."
5504.36,5506.08, And we'll be able to talk all about it.
5506.08,5507.48, Yep.
5507.48,5508.32, Cool.
5509.28,5509.96, OK.
5509.96,5511.32, As I grew winding down on the show.
5515.32,5515.92, Yeah.
5515.92,5516.92," Jack, you look at it."
5516.92,5518.36," That was in this, just so much."
5518.36,5521.48," I was like, of like, total, he's in this position."
5521.48,5524.48, That total relaxation right now is hands behind his back.
5524.48,5526.32, He's got his legs cramps.
5526.32,5528.32, You look like he could just do so.
5528.32,5532.12," Like, I could any moment now, without that way,"
5532.12,5534.96," that reminded me though, if you had people over for drinks,"
5534.96,5536.5599999999995," you know, and it's like, time to go."
5536.5599999999995,5537.5599999999995," Oh, okay."
5537.56,5538.400000000001, Whoa.
5538.400000000001,5540.240000000001," Well, time looks like we're done here."
5540.240000000001,5541.240000000001, Yeah.
5541.240000000001,5542.4400000000005, So it's just untalking.
5542.4400000000005,5546.92," Dude, even bring it up, I had people over on Sunday for six hours."
5546.92,5547.72," Oh, dude."
5547.72,5552.120000000001," I was hung out on my couch about no music, nothing, nothing happening."
5552.120000000001,5552.96, No food.
5552.96,5553.8, Where you talking?
5553.8,5556.6," We were just talking and there were talking moments of like,"
5556.6,5559.120000000001," and I mean, my wife keep thinking like, any minute now,"
5559.120000000001,5561.280000000001," they're going to be like, well, we should go."
5561.280000000001,5562.120000000001, But you didn't do that.
5562.120000000001,5563.04, You didn't make that move.
5563.04,5564.04, You didn't do that.
5564.04,5565.04," Oh, no."
5565.04,5567.52, I just kept on picking up the newspaper and reading it.
5567.52,5569.120000000001," Like, oh, that's good enough."
5569.120000000001,5570.0, That's a good idea.
5570.0,5570.52, Yeah.
5570.52,5573.040000000001, I'm just waiting for you guys to clear the couch so I can lay back
5573.040000000001,5573.76, down and read you.
5573.76,5574.6, Thanks.
5574.6,5575.6, But yeah.
5575.6,5577.68, That's a little passive.
5577.68,5578.120000000001, Yeah.
5578.120000000001,5579.76, I should have been.
5579.76,5580.92, You've both got a bad idea.
5580.92,5583.68, That's a good thing about kids too.
5583.68,5583.92, Yeah.
5583.92,5586.52, Because you got to get me a kid.
5586.52,5587.52, Get the bed.
5587.52,5588.52, But she's 13.
5588.52,5590.76," And now and then, though, you have friends that, like,"
5590.76,5593.52," you're just that comfortable with each other, where you like,"
5593.52,5594.76, I can get the fuck out.
5594.76,5595.040000000001, Yeah.
5595.040000000001,5595.240000000001, Yeah.
5595.240000000001,5595.4400000000005, Yeah.
5595.4400000000005,5596.72, Yeah.
5596.72,5597.56, I think I'll share.
5597.56,5598.240000000001, Right.
5598.240000000001,5598.56, Yeah.
5598.56,5599.92, Sure.
5599.92,5600.76, You pissing me off.
5600.76,5601.72, You just flat out.
5601.72,5602.56, Yeah.
5602.56,5603.72, I'm just a fuck out.
5603.72,5605.04, Yeah.
5605.04,5607.52, I just couldn't think of any excuse for some reason.
5607.52,5609.4800000000005, So you just sat there and offered a pilot there.
5609.4800000000005,5610.56, Six hours.
5610.56,5611.96, Do they run with down?
5611.96,5613.280000000001, Do they listen to this podcast?
5613.280000000001,5614.4400000000005, Because they'll not be on the level.
5614.4400000000005,5615.4400000000005, No.
5615.4400000000005,5616.240000000001, They don't listen to it.
5616.240000000001,5617.4400000000005, They don't.
5617.4400000000005,5619.400000000001, Maybe they didn't even know our list.
5619.400000000001,5621.320000000001," Hey, just fast forward about an hour and a half."
5621.320000000001,5623.16, I've got a special message for you.
5623.16,5623.6, Yeah.
5623.6,5625.68, You stayed about four hours two weeks.
5626.12,5627.4800000000005, Okay.
5627.4800000000005,5631.320000000001, This podcast has gone 20 minutes too long.
5631.320000000001,5632.320000000001, Yeah.
5632.320000000001,5633.320000000001, All right.
5633.320000000001,5634.72, We didn't know when to stop.
5634.72,5635.72, Yeah.
5635.72,5637.72, Say one last thing.
5637.72,5638.72, We don't know how to stop.
5638.72,5639.72, One last thing.
5639.72,5640.72, Yeah.
5640.72,5641.72, I've run.
5641.72,5642.72, That was it.
5642.72,5643.72, One last thing.
5643.72,5645.72," Oh, shit."
5645.72,5646.72, I just remembered.
5646.72,5647.72, I forgot.
5647.72,5650.56, I had a bunch of urban words of the day to bring in these guys.
5650.56,5653.72, My favorite little telling us now daily website.
5653.72,5654.72, Yeah.
5654.72,5655.72, I'm going to be a one.
5655.72,5657.92, I just want to run and buy you an ask if you'd heard of that.
5657.92,5658.92, So I'm going to leave.
5658.92,5659.92, Yeah.
5659.92,5660.92, So it's what?
5660.92,5661.92, Dillic.
5661.92,5662.92, Dillic.
5662.92,5663.92, Yeah.
5663.92,5664.92, But this is all caps.
5664.92,5666.72, So it's like a long acronym.
5666.72,5667.72," And to my logic, please."
5667.72,5668.72, Sounds like bullshit to me.
5668.72,5671.72, It does look like I give a fuck.
5671.72,5672.72, That's bullshit.
5672.72,5673.92, That's not an urban word.
5673.92,5676.280000000001," That's like, that's like somematic dillbert."
5676.280000000001,5678.88," Well, sometimes the urban word of the day is come."
5678.88,5681.16, They're like message board trolls stuff.
5681.16,5682.360000000001," You know, like, brodio."
5682.360000000001,5684.6, I'm sure brodio is not using.
5684.6,5685.92," I know, but that's where it came from."
5685.92,5686.92, Urban word today.
5686.92,5689.88," Creel and Merkin and you know, like, krunk."
5689.88,5690.88, No.
5690.88,5694.4800000000005, That's what you just said.
5694.4800000000005,5695.4800000000005, I heard that word.
5695.4800000000005,5698.88," I was like, if you could tell, if you could tell Jeff and it's familiar, then it's"
5698.88,5699.88, no longer.
5699.88,5700.88, Then it's not.
5700.88,5701.88, I'm fair.
5701.88,5703.4400000000005, I'm cool with that.
5703.4400000000005,5704.4400000000005, That's.
5704.4400000000005,5705.4400000000005, That's her.
5705.4400000000005,5706.88, Do you shot in your only like 10 years away from that?
5706.88,5707.88, I know.
5707.88,5709.160000000001, I'm I'm pretending myself.
5709.160000000001,5710.160000000001, I'm.
5710.160000000001,5711.160000000001, All right.
5711.160000000001,5712.160000000001, Okay.
5712.160000000001,5713.160000000001, We're down here.
5713.160000000001,5714.160000000001, Ryan.
5714.72,5715.72, Mm-hmm.
5715.72,5717.36, You got nothing.
5717.36,5717.96, You got to switch.
5717.96,5718.96, Just wait.
5718.96,5720.599999999999, That's nothing.
5720.599999999999,5721.44, And we out.
