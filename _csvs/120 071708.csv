22.8,28.8, Hello and welcome to GFW Radio. We are podcasting from E3.
28.8,34.8, This is the last day of E3. We got an hour to get the hell out of here and go back to San Francisco.
34.8,40.8, I guess Ryan Scott's already on his way. The dipshit miss the last podcast here now so he's fired.
40.8,45.8, I just did it on air. You guys know before he does.
45.8,52.8, It's been nice working with you Ryan. We got Mark knows we're the hair from Releken or Taming. You are a producer.
52.8,56.8," Yeah, I'm very sure I'm done on our two. Don't worry too. Thank you for joining us."
56.8,58.8, Thanks for having me guys. We also have Sean Elliott.
58.8,60.8, Hello and Terri Nguyen.
60.8,61.8, Hello and welcome.
61.8,62.8, Scooter.
62.8,67.8, Hi. So here we are at the show.
67.8,68.8, Wow. How's it going?
68.8,72.8, That's going pretty well since been a long couple days.
72.8,79.8," Yeah, that's fun. You know talking about gaming making for two years and that you really like playing is pretty easy."
79.8,83.8, So it's probably easier than the guys back at work in the office right now.
83.8,85.8," Yeah, they're probably jealous of you."
85.8,88.8, That's different from what I just saw.
88.8,92.8, I just got done seeing postal 3 and I don't want to rip on too much.
92.8,97.8," But it's like a good way to also use, I mean, you know, how's the show is kind of like how's the weather when you're D3."
97.8,99.8, So I do want to ask you that just because I'm curious.
99.8,105.8," But also I had someone ask me this again from, you know, the marketing guru guru from postal."
105.8,108.8, Like how's the show in the before I can answer?
108.8,110.8, You didn't really care what I thought.
110.8,113.8, This show fucking sucks and he looks around.
113.8,116.8," There's like, you know, knowing, you know, the final day it's wrapping up."
116.8,120.8," There's a few people as they just, you know, select press and stuff and looks around down in the showcase"
120.8,124.8," but going in and there's a lot of these empty key asks and he's like, yeah, fucking sucks."
124.8,126.8, It's like it's a waste of money.
126.8,131.8," And I was like, well, you know, what's the deal? Like you don't have enough, you don't feel like you have enough eyes on your product or whatever."
131.8,135.8," Go, I'm fine right here. I'm fine right here. It's like, these big companies spend in all this money."
135.8,139.8," That's like, okay, this is an interesting way to get going on this game."
139.8,144.8," And then so the next thing you're like doing this demo and I see him, he's got a vacuum cleaner."
144.8,147.8," I mean, and you know what, you're familiar with postal, right?"
147.8,148.8," Yeah, a little bit."
148.8,154.8," And it's a high brawl, he's got a vacuum cleaner and he's going around to this portal shop, suck it up, come rags."
155.8,157.8," Oh, I'm just way to get into it."
157.8,159.8, This is a new weapon in this game.
159.8,164.8," And you then shoot them, you know, you switch the polarity or something on the vacuum cleaner and then you pull it back."
164.8,166.8, You shoot the rags.
166.8,168.8, And you just do that for a while.
168.8,171.8," This is your job, your basically, but the cleanup boy in the shop,"
171.8,174.8, but then these fat soccer moms come in and they're protesting.
174.8,178.8," But instead of standing around outside, they're going all through the portal shop protesting."
178.8,181.8, So you're supposed to shoot them with the come rags.
181.8,186.8," And as you do so, you're supposed to meet your maximum amount of six soccer moms pwned."
186.8,190.8," You know, it's like PWM and we're in a hot."
190.8,193.8," So, you know, we're doing that."
193.8,196.8, And the next thing I hear the guys like this fucking engine sucks.
196.8,199.8," And I was like, we need a big guy making the game, so that's..."
199.8,204.8," Well, I don't know if he's making a diesel, you know, the marketing guru or someone other marketing guru."
204.8,205.8, Yeah.
205.8,207.8," Hey, I could, well, I don't have this card on me."
207.8,209.8, It's given I were trying to figure out what it was.
209.8,212.8," Something Jewish like marketing, loyal."
212.8,213.8, What's that?
213.8,215.8," You know, loyal to the I-"
215.8,216.8, It's a guy's decision.
216.8,219.8, The guy who just got sort of his business card says.
219.8,222.8, So maybe this is the case if the marketing itself is the foreskin.
222.8,224.8, He's cutting off the marketing.
224.8,227.8," Oh, my, we're already giving him more press than they deserve."
227.8,229.8, They love this stuff.
229.8,232.8, And then this teach QPR persons over there a phrase.
232.8,234.8," Like, please talk about my game."
234.8,236.8, So talking about the horrible marketing.
236.8,239.8," I think, like, to hear him say this."
239.8,241.8," And he's like, well, you know, I like the engine."
241.8,243.8," I was like, well, what engine is it?"
243.8,244.8," And he's like, it's sourcing."
244.8,250.8," But then he was kind of complaining because in the previous post-algame, I guess they had some serious issues with unreal engine at the time."
250.8,252.8," Whatever iteration it was, you know, that they're using."
252.8,253.8, It didn't work out.
253.8,256.8," And it's like, can't, you know, it's not the, it wasn't the best for open world."
256.8,258.8," No, we kind of made the mistake again."
258.8,259.8, Sources in the best for open world.
259.8,261.8," And it's like, but it's cheap and easy to use."
261.8,263.8," You know, it's like we can't afford unreal 3."
263.8,267.8, And it's a pretty surreal dim.
267.8,268.8," Yeah, it's weird."
268.8,269.8, It does.
269.8,270.8, But it's just a dirty laundry.
270.8,273.8," It's like, yeah, he's like setting dogs on fire."
273.8,275.8," Like the next mission is you go to this, like,"
275.8,277.8, Today still have the cat silence or thing.
277.8,281.8, There was probably a how like playing a cat and gun turns into a silencer.
281.8,284.8," You had to, oh, a monkey appeared on his back."
284.8,286.8," He's like, we have a lot of things with animals because he goes in to see this like,"
286.8,287.8, Caesar Molon type spoof guy.
287.8,291.8, And you're supposed to be training a dog with the laser pointer so that you can get it to attack people later on.
291.8,295.8," But then he's, you know, like he gets bored of training the dog so he."
295.8,296.8, What?
296.8,298.8," Well, he's talking about his whispering to me on air."
298.8,299.8, Is it for not on air?
299.8,300.8, The choice you're on.
300.8,301.8, You're on my microphone.
301.8,302.8," Actually, I realize you did."
302.8,304.8, I'm thinking about your stupid bat signal thing.
304.8,305.8, I got it right here.
305.8,308.8, Got my bat man pen.
308.8,313.8," Sorry, he was when he said laser pointer just made a thick of Jeff distracting people with a stupid bat signal."
313.8,314.8, It's right.
314.8,318.8, So you're supposed to train this dog with the laser pointer and he gets bored of that.
318.8,319.8, So he pours gas on it.
319.8,322.8," Burns it to death and then this moment he's like, we got a lot of animals."
322.8,324.8," A monkey appears on his back and it's like, so what's this?"
324.8,325.8," He's like, I don't know."
325.8,328.8," It's just, you know, it just kind of got put in a couple days ago."
328.8,330.8, And this was like another mystery.
330.8,334.8," I mean, I guess if he's a marketing loyal, then it's like, he's not designing it."
334.8,337.8," He's like, well, you know, we, so I said, this is how this game is being designed."
337.8,340.8," You just come up with an idea and just throw it in, you know, and things just appear."
340.8,343.8," And he's like, well, we got a design document, but I don't know."
343.8,344.8, And he said something about Moscow.
344.8,346.8, That's where part of the game is being made.
346.8,350.8," And somewhere else, but so he's like, I do know that the monkey, you can command it to"
350.8,354.8," Pardon me for this Vanessa, but you can make it."
354.8,358.8, Fuck people in their face and throw PCs on their been.
358.8,361.8," The whole time we were sitting there, we were like, I was laughing."
361.8,362.8, I felt bad.
362.8,363.8, I felt bad.
363.8,364.8, Skippers with me.
364.8,367.8," And I was like, I hope Skippers and think I'm laughing because I think this is quality humor."
367.8,368.8, I'm laughing.
368.8,373.8," Just like, how I kept tripping on stuff like when he's like, we had a design document."
373.8,374.8, Like this engine sucks.
374.8,378.8," Like somewhere in Moscow, that was all this stuff that I was still laughing about, but it would"
378.8,379.8, bite of a look.
379.8,383.8, If you were just passing by as though I were laughing at the idea of shooting this stuff at
383.8,386.8," people, and then there was like a guy and a woman there and they were looking in the guy."
386.8,389.8, Just kept laughing and looking at the woman to see if she was laughing or I'm living.
389.8,391.8, She was just like stone face though.
391.8,392.8, I'm order five probably.
392.8,393.8, Yeah.
393.8,396.8," So I think it's probably going to, you don't find a market right?"
396.8,397.8, I'm not sure if you'd do.
397.8,398.8, I'm not sure if you'd do.
398.8,399.8, I'm not sure if you'd do.
399.8,401.8," Well, depending on the market, I have to make three of them."
401.8,407.8," And it's all about, you know, if you can do a cheap enough, everything can be profitable."
407.8,408.8, Right.
408.8,409.8, Right.
409.8,413.8," I'm glad that Relic is taking kind of a higher, higher stance."
413.8,414.8, Yeah.
414.8,415.8, I'm telling you.
415.8,417.8, It's really no comarags and don't want to.
417.8,419.8, I did say that.
419.8,422.8, I'm pretty sure a game's worth of being a quarter of that.
422.8,423.8, You do have some.
423.8,426.8, There's a GF thread title right now.
426.8,428.8, You do have some confirmed.
429.8,430.8, No comarags.
430.8,437.8, You got something that's not unlike the pizza thrower and the teenage me Ninja Turtles though.
437.8,439.8," That's the, um, it's our for the joke."
439.8,442.8, That's the the ork battle wagon or something.
442.8,443.8, I had to I had to fess up too.
443.8,447.8," I was that was the one thing I was like, focus on it because you know what I was saying?"
447.8,452.8," Like if you're if you're a company here's fan, you're exactly the sort of person who's like,"
452.8,453.8, I'm cool.
453.8,454.8," Of course, I'm cool with this Sherman."
454.8,457.8, It's a real tank and then other people like what's all this is just where we're too stuff.
457.8,461.8," And those are the ones that like the battle wagon and then I'm the group that's like,"
461.8,464.8, Did I see the teenage me Ninja Turtles?
464.8,466.8, It's it's the ork stuff.
466.8,468.8, All their things are like goofy like that.
468.8,469.8, For the company.
469.8,472.8," Yeah, for the company here's first and you'll probably, you know,"
472.8,475.8, that's that's what the Imperial Guard equipment is for.
475.8,478.8," Like actually like actual Sherman looking tank with except has got like,"
478.8,481.8," you know, like, got more guns and blades on it."
481.8,482.8, Right.
482.8,486.8," Actually, I wanted to ask you guys because when we podcast at the first day,"
486.8,491.8, we had also just seen it on a war two and one thing that I noticed and and
491.8,495.8," you tell me if my perception is offered not, but I felt like"
495.8,501.8, Don't have one in the expansions like sort of pushed the kind of
501.8,506.8," cartoony aspect of the of the art design a little more like the the,"
506.8,509.8, especially like the ork so are particularly goofy.
509.8,513.8, And then what we solved on a four to it looked like like almost more
513.8,516.8, coin unquote realistic or a little gritty or darker.
516.8,520.8," Yeah, we are going for more realistic look with the art direction like the,"
520.8,524.8," the essence engine, some company here was like it was built to create,"
524.8,526.8," recreate world war two, right?"
526.8,530.8, So everything was really high fidelity and it just made sense for us to pull
530.8,531.8, it night direction.
531.8,535.8," It also just differentiates us from our competition, which is more,"
535.8,538.8," you know, more cartoony and more childlike and, you know,"
538.8,540.8," it's a maturity at RTS, so we wanted to look mature."
540.8,544.8," So, and you know, in the grim dark future, there is only war."
544.8,547.8," So it's supposed to be pretty serious and, but the work still,"
547.8,550.8," we do think they add that human element, you know, they're pretty cool and they're"
550.8,553.8," funny and, you know, they still use z's and a lot of their unit names."
553.8,555.8," Yeah, total that kind of their kind of race."
555.8,557.8," And their animations are way more over the top, you know,"
557.8,560.8," like some of their sinkills and, you know, like one of the stick"
560.8,562.8," bombers, he's got a really cool stick."
562.8,566.8," St. Kill, because he'll pull a stick bomb off of the back of his chest and"
566.8,568.8, he'll have a rubber to cross.
568.8,569.8, Sorry.
569.8,572.8," And, and light it up on the enemies chest and then jump"
572.8,574.8, up and throws it down and then the explosion will go off and you'll flip
574.8,577.8," backwards and it just, it looks awesome."
577.8,580.8," Yeah, I thought it was, um, it like it surprised me,"
580.8,585.8," not in a bad way, but just because I was used to the series having, you know,"
585.8,587.8, a more cartoony look.
587.8,591.8," Yeah, you know, it was a, it was a choice we made on purpose."
591.8,593.8," I was pointing out to you though, if you look, if you look at the,"
593.8,596.8, you look at the literature for the warhammer.
596.8,599.8," Yeah, it's totally violent, you know, I mean those books that you said this."
599.8,601.8," But yeah, now and then, I mean it's, like,"
601.8,603.8," like, grotesque stuff, you know, like guys with like,"
603.8,606.8," post chaos warriors with like, maggots and post coming out of him and stuff."
606.8,608.8," And it's like, it's always been that mix of,"
608.8,612.8, of like the pizza thrower and just like utter destruction.
612.8,616.8," And no one is, no one is laughing or telling jokes in the entire universe."
616.8,618.8," You know, it's just the constant horrors of war."
618.8,619.8, I don't think.
619.8,620.8," Is it, right?"
620.8,622.8," I mean, well, you read from that big, but you get,"
622.8,625.8," there's like some enormous Bible of like more hammer 40,"
625.8,628.8," not 40,000, but the original warhammer stuff."
628.8,630.8," And it, it's pretty heavy duty."
630.8,631.8, Uh-huh.
631.8,632.8," It's like dipping into,"
632.8,634.8," No, that's kind of life book series."
634.8,635.8, Is that the Bible?
635.8,637.8," Is that the Bible that, that's why that like,"
637.8,638.8, orght or testimony in mushrooms?
638.8,639.8, What?
639.8,641.8, I didn't read that far in Newman.
641.8,644.8," Apparently, I think, I think that, and my applied to the 40K,"
644.8,647.8," but it's supposedly orght or literally spaced mushrooms like that they,"
647.8,648.8, grow intelligent somehow.
648.8,650.8," Oh, look, see, he's confirming it."
650.8,652.8," Well, he's getting a nod from Mark."
652.8,654.8," I can't tell he confirmed, but I've heard,"
654.8,656.8," like, I've known I'd as up on the lore of some of the guys,"
656.8,660.8," but you know, I, I don't understand anything I shouldn't,"
660.8,663.8," but yeah, well, it's, it might be a safe assumption,"
663.8,665.8," but yeah, supposedly because they're supposed to be kind of analogous,"
665.8,666.8," you know, even though they're,"
666.8,668.8," they're, they're like, orght or the ground and stuff, you know,"
668.8,671.8," but yeah, there's basically like orght or literally just mushrooms"
671.8,672.8, like they're funguest.
672.8,673.8," Yeah, they're funguys."
673.8,675.8, They're just like the intelligent one.
675.8,676.8, Yeah.
676.8,678.8, This is like frighteningly close to this discussion that we're having
678.8,681.8," because in an IGN review for Hale to the Chimp, the intro."
681.8,683.8," Oh, God, the squid."
683.8,687.8," The intro said that it, it's got like, you know,"
687.8,689.8," whatever all these creatures, all these animals,"
689.8,691.8, including a squid.
691.8,694.8," And then parenthetically it's like, but the squid's not even an animal"
694.8,695.8, technically.
695.8,699.8, And then the great thing was that it's an octopus in the game.
699.8,703.8, But then of course that thing hanging there that a squid's not an animal.
703.8,705.8," So we were all joking, like, what is it like, you know,"
705.8,706.8, funguys?
707.8,709.8," Sorry, that didn't have much to do with the beta broad"
709.8,711.8, aspect of animals and fungus.
711.8,715.8," And actually, they were debating whether or not ork's or people."
715.8,718.8," I swear, it's actually the warhammer online guys"
718.8,721.8, come from at least from the warhammer fantasy universe.
721.8,724.8, Orks are mushrooms that grew in telagene.
724.8,726.8, I changed my whole world view.
726.8,729.8," We can double check some other time, the not waste marks time"
729.8,731.8, and figuring out whether the face orks are funguys.
731.8,734.8, So are you guys playing warhammer at your office?
734.8,736.8," I mean, like the table, the table tough game."
736.8,739.8," Oh, yeah, every day there's like seriously tons of hardcore fans"
739.8,742.8, and I'd say even more in the last couple months that started getting into it.
742.8,744.8, Like there's there's a campaign going on right now.
744.8,747.8," We've got two rooms that people have, you know,"
747.8,751.8," the their map all set up and it's all being tracked online because, you know,"
751.8,754.8, there's software for this open source software people can use and you get to do it.
754.8,755.8, You're on figurine.
755.8,757.8," Yeah, some of the guys do."
757.8,759.8," Well, I guess in North America,"
759.8,762.8," it's sort of okay to play without painted figurines,"
762.8,766.8," but like I think and especially in Europe, it's like totally uncool to feel"
766.8,768.8, the army that isn't painted.
768.8,769.8, Right?
769.8,770.8," If you went out of your two rooms,"
770.8,771.8, you're with the untimainted figure.
771.8,772.8, You can't play.
772.8,773.8, Like don't write it for me.
773.8,775.8, You just open down a service.
775.8,776.8, Yeah.
776.8,777.8, Get you all unpainted.
777.8,779.8, Basically you kind of hit you paint.
779.8,781.8," I was thinking like, you know, the whole thing is, you know,"
781.8,784.8," you want people to care about the tiny units of their,"
784.8,786.8," that they're commanding and it's like in a way, like,"
786.8,788.8, painting it is their solution.
788.8,790.8," I mean, if you spend all this time painting a figure,"
790.8,792.8, then you're going to care about it somewhere.
792.8,793.8, I don't know.
793.8,794.8, Sure.
794.8,795.8, That's cocky.
795.8,796.8," But, right?"
796.8,797.8," Yeah, the ownership in the table,"
797.8,800.8, top of you painting your figurines is really similar to what we're trying to do on a more
800.8,802.8," to just really ramp up your attachment to these guys,"
802.8,804.8," because, you know, you can customize your weapons,"
804.8,806.8," your armor, your accessories, can we paint it?"
806.8,808.8," And even their talents and abilities,"
808.8,811.8," you know, the army painters have been a feature of Donna Waller and"
811.8,815.8," the original and won't go into too many details on it,"
815.8,817.8, but we'll certainly have something similar to Donna Waller to.
818.8,820.8," So what it, um,"
820.8,823.8," how is the show like, let's get back to that and how's the show for you so far?"
823.8,826.8," I think, well, the show's been awesome for Donna Waller."
826.8,828.8, I think everyone's really like in what they're seeing.
828.8,831.8," You know, you got the hardcore TS fans that know exactly what we're talking about,"
831.8,833.8," and then we explain why we're doing the things we're doing,"
833.8,835.8," and they're like, wow, that's really cool."
835.8,836.8, I really want to play that.
836.8,838.8," And then, we've got a lot of other guys that are,"
838.8,840.8," like, wow, it's kind of stopped playing our TS, you know,"
840.8,842.8," I've been played since like Starcraft, a little blah,"
842.8,844.8," John or Dixon, to the interest me,"
844.8,846.8," and then by the end of that, they're like, wow,"
846.8,849.8," I play your game. So, that's really good."
849.8,853.8," In terms of the new format, I think this is way better than,"
853.8,856.8," you know, the nonsense and shenanigans we had in the nearest past,"
856.8,857.8," like, interesting."
857.8,859.8," It's definitely like a 50, 50 seconds."
859.8,860.8, That's me and you know.
860.8,863.8," Well, I think there's, it gets, well, it's all about the games, right?"
863.8,867.8," So when a demo do you guys sat down, you can hear what I've said,"
867.8,871.8," you can hear the music, you can hear the, the unit responses in the game."
871.8,874.8," You knew what was going on, you, you're understanding what the experience was,"
874.8,877.8," you know, and we didn't have like strippers and people burning their knipples"
877.8,878.8," and stuff like 10 feet away, right?"
878.8,880.8," Like, it wasn't, you know, like, it was crazy."
880.8,882.8," You scored a buzz, but that was unrelated."
882.8,884.8," Those, those Korean booths, it was crazy."
884.8,885.8, It was crazy.
885.8,887.8," It was crazy in the past, you know, fire, everything."
887.8,889.8," Fire, breathe, there's an alternate nonsense,"
889.8,891.8," and like, what does that have to do with video games?"
891.8,893.8," Well, people, a lot of people seem to miss that."
893.8,894.8, Yeah.
894.8,896.8," I think many cases, the very ones who complained about it when it was here."
896.8,897.8, Yeah.
897.8,900.8," And I miss it. And I think that's what I got from the postal guy was like,"
900.8,902.8," when he looked around, what he meant to indicate was like,"
902.8,905.8," there's just games, like, where's like, I think a lot of it."
905.8,907.8, I think it's something that's just like industry ego.
907.8,910.8," We're like, well, we're not a big deal anymore because we don't have like,"
910.8,915.8," you know, fire breathers and all sorts of tomfooler and nonsense that's getting"
915.8,918.8," weird television stations to come recorded and 50 cents,"
918.8,920.8, not coming to promote as game anymore.
920.8,922.8," But that's, who cares about that stuff, right?"
922.8,925.8," Like, is that really going to, I think that's more chance"
925.8,926.8, to get more on the work.
926.8,928.8, I think it's mostly ego now.
928.8,929.8, Yeah.
929.8,934.8," You know, having USA today come down to the booth and interview people is really good."
934.8,937.8," Right? And if we're not getting that, then that sucks."
937.8,939.8," And then, you know, we need to do better PR, right?"
939.8,943.8," But I think, you know, the focus on games and getting more information out to"
943.8,946.8, consumers about what these games are about and what they should be looking for
946.8,948.8, to the format is way better.
948.8,949.8, Mm-hmm.
949.8,952.8," Yeah. I was at a, at a big booth yesterday."
952.8,955.8," And I don't want to say the company's name, but they were like all looked like"
955.8,958.8," two of a person like bomb, they were sitting there like they were on."
958.8,961.8," Like a dentist waiting room. You know, there was like hardly anybody in there."
961.8,964.8," And I was like, sorry, you guys not happy with the show."
964.8,966.8, Kind of an obvious question because they just looked miserable.
966.8,968.8," And they said, yeah, now this sucks for us."
968.8,970.8, And I asked them why.
970.8,973.8," And there were actually people in there looking at games like, you know,"
973.8,976.8, actual game journalists type people.
976.8,980.8," And they said that they, what they missed the most was, I mean,"
980.8,984.8, and they admitted it that it was an ego thing that they missed the attention
985.8,988.8, of like the hordes of people just like crowded around.
988.8,991.8, Like it has made them feel better to have these people.
991.8,993.8, And we weren't really going to give them anything.
993.8,996.8," But it was like having the gawk or say like the noise, say like,"
996.8,1001.8," but it was just a circus, you know, like, I've done 130 demos the last two days."
1001.8,1004.8, And every single one was someone that actually mattered and was going to
1004.8,1006.8," talk to thousands of people in one way or another, right?"
1006.8,1008.8," So really significant, but a couple years ago, I remember it's"
1008.8,1010.8, definitely one of these guys on the floor.
1010.8,1012.8," And they look kind of young, but I was going to discriminate or anything."
1012.8,1014.8, So I've talked about 15 minutes.
1014.8,1016.8," And I said, so who you guys were like, oh, you know,"
1016.8,1020.8," our high school newspaper, I was just like, oh, God."
1020.8,1022.8," You know, like, what does it come to?"
1022.8,1025.8," Like, and it was cool."
1025.8,1028.8," They like the game, but like that's not what the, you know,"
1028.8,1030.8, you don't have these conventions for that purpose.
1030.8,1032.8," You know, you don't, you know, this is about selling product."
1032.8,1034.8," Why though, do you think we, I mean, I mean,"
1034.8,1037.8," I still, that's still for me, doesn't answer necessarily why we have"
1037.8,1039.8," the convention because, I mean, from your point of view,"
1039.8,1041.8," yes, that means you're getting people to look at your game."
1041.8,1044.8," But it also means you're getting, you're still thinking you're getting a fairly"
1044.8,1045.8, shallow look.
1045.8,1047.8," Maybe it's better than like if we,"
1047.8,1050.8," nudge, we nudge in shoulders, shoulder with 50 other people,"
1050.8,1053.8, we have a bit of enough of a tension span to pay attention for five minutes.
1053.8,1055.8, And then we're not distracted and turning to look at another game.
1055.8,1057.8," It's still much different than say, if like, you know,"
1057.8,1060.8," Jeff came up to your studio, spend it afternoon there,"
1060.8,1063.8," came back, you know, like did multiple interviews with with a team,"
1063.8,1066.8, came back and was able to write on it and develop a full.
1066.8,1068.8," Yeah, obviously you get better coverage that way,"
1068.8,1070.8," but that's about economies of scale, right?"
1070.8,1073.8, And you got the buyers and sellers and this is a way for them all to meet in one place.
1073.8,1074.8, All right?
1074.8,1075.8," So, so yeah, you're red."
1075.8,1078.8," I mean, what are you getting from having everyone meet?"
1078.8,1081.8," Well, instead of coordinating 50 different press events at Ralec,"
1081.8,1085.8," right, we just have, you know, couch in a TV where we sit there for three days"
1085.8,1089.8," and you guys show up and I like, I think it works really well from our perspective."
1089.8,1090.8, Right.
1090.8,1093.8," You know, you guys work all day long, see all these games and, you know,"
1093.8,1095.8," get, you probably get pretty tired, it's seen."
1095.8,1098.8," And then all night, you just type reports and stuff and you're writing,"
1099.8,1102.8," you know, editorials and like, so it's rough on you guys."
1102.8,1103.8, It's worse than it is for us.
1103.8,1109.8," And this, I mean, Sean, I mean, I know you agree that this is much easier for us to for that very reason."
1109.8,1113.8," Like, even if, which I agree with you, like the coverage,"
1113.8,1119.8," you know, if we have a half hour demo here that that's much shall or obviously then going and spending a day at the studio,"
1119.8,1125.8," it's still like infinitely better than it used to be at E3 here where we might have the same things going on,"
1125.8,1130.8," but there were 800,000 people and noises and they still get around us."
1130.8,1132.8, It's good even if possible here.
1132.8,1134.8, I think we all get different things out of it.
1134.8,1137.8," I mean, I like being able to get a quick survey of the entire land, you know,"
1137.8,1140.8," and see these, these are all the things that are going on this year."
1140.8,1143.8, And then I could step away from it and look for patterns and stuff.
1143.8,1146.8," I mean, I know it's not GDC, but I'm kind of, I mean, it was kind of curious,"
1146.8,1149.8," like if on the development side, I mean, if there's any networking,"
1149.8,1152.8," despite it, or just, you know, scouting the competition and reporting back."
1152.8,1153.8," Yeah, I do miss that."
1153.8,1156.8," I do miss that, like I used to like to walk around for a couple hours and see,"
1156.8,1160.8," oh, I can't even get a downstairs or 50 people are standing out on outside this theater"
1160.8,1161.8, to find out about this game.
1161.8,1166.8," Well, that must be a big deal or, um, so I do miss that, like the pavilion they have this year's okay,"
1166.8,1168.8," but kind of walk around and, you know,"
1168.8,1170.8, I didn't really encourage to play the games.
1170.8,1173.8," It's so close and everything's really cramped, but I do miss that."
1173.8,1176.8," Like that was really nice, but, you know, that's what the internet's for."
1176.8,1178.8," That's what it one-ups for, right?"
1178.8,1179.8," I'll go home, I get home tonight."
1179.8,1181.8, I'm going to go on the on.
1181.8,1184.8," I'm starting surfing, go to game trailers and start watching it, right?"
1184.8,1189.8," So I found even when you had the big short floor, the lineups were so stupid."
1189.8,1193.8," It takes a long time to get into a game too, so I almost didn't play any,"
1193.8,1197.8," because I just, you know, I was just watching anyway."
1197.8,1199.8," So I can get just as much from trailers, I think."
1199.8,1203.8," You're demonstrating your game, like behind closed doors in a room."
1203.8,1207.8," You know, I mean, the pavilion we're talking about is a closest thing to the old format at E3,"
1207.8,1209.8, where there's just a ton of chaos that you can go and play.
1209.8,1213.8," And we're saying that, like, I mean, that format is really, you know,"
1213.8,1215.8, slanted toward pick up and play games.
1215.8,1217.8," You know, I was telling you, like, right before we take it,"
1217.8,1219.8," and I come on, I wanted to bring it back up."
1219.8,1224.8," Like, on one side of the aisle is, you know, our wee games that you can just pick up,"
1224.8,1227.8," wag the controller around, smile for a couple of minutes and put down and then right next to it,"
1227.8,1229.8," I was trying to play brothers, norms."
1229.8,1231.8," Hell's highway, which I'm totally fan of the series."
1231.8,1234.8," I love it. Again, it's more world-oriented, which is exactly what I want,"
1234.8,1236.8, provided it's done well.
1236.8,1240.8," I really admire some of the things. They've, they've done with that series,"
1240.8,1242.8, but I go to pick it up there.
1242.8,1245.8," And it's like, I mean, like, shade on my ready for this."
1245.8,1249.8," Like, do I really want to, like, sit and try to focus on this game standing right here right now,"
1249.8,1253.8," and then, you know, hearing all these sounds next door, and it's like, I mean,"
1253.8,1257.8," you were making an analogy of, like, what if movies were demonstrated this way?"
1257.8,1260.8," Yeah, and you walk into Rimmins, 30 screens, and everything's blasting."
1260.8,1263.8," And you see your explosion on one screen, you know, like, I'm going to watch this,"
1263.8,1267.8," and then a girl starts taking her top off with another, and you're all going over here,"
1267.8,1272.8," like, what, you know, it's just not a good way to, you know, get a glimpse of entertainment, right?"
1272.8,1274.8," It's a good sounds like a good time, but."
1274.8,1279.8," No, it's necessary overload, but it's together, and it runs into one movie in your mind,"
1279.8,1283.8," and it's like, kind of that word at the games."
1283.8,1286.8, Did you guys see anything else this morning?
1286.8,1291.8," Well, I saw Dragon Age over at Bioware, which they weren't even on before."
1291.8,1293.8, They were like in their own hotel room.
1293.8,1297.8," They had their own hotel room, and I thought it looked great."
1297.8,1301.8," So, and I thought the, you know, I was at, I was wondering,"
1301.8,1305.8," what if yours, or I forget where, you know, people were talking about,"
1305.8,1307.8, it just looks like a lot of the rings.
1307.8,1311.8," You know, that's the kind of comment you make when you've seen the game for, like, two seconds,"
1311.8,1315.8," and you haven't actually seen it, or, you know, given it a chance."
1315.8,1320.8," So, you know, yes, the one cut scene they showed looks a little bit like,"
1320.8,1323.8," it looks deep, but then they show a lot more that doesn't look anything like that."
1323.8,1325.8," And in fact, that was just a cut scene."
1325.8,1328.8," You know, when they actually went down and showed the game plan,"
1328.8,1335.8," so the combat, I think you, I mean, I was really happy because it really did look like exactly what they're talking about,"
1335.8,1338.8," like a quote unquote, spiritual successor to Baldur's game."
1338.8,1345.8," But like, for 2008, so you can go all the way back out to that isometric perspective,"
1345.8,1348.8," and pause the combat, and do a just like Baldur's Gate 2,"
1348.8,1355.8," but then on the other hand, you know, the engine is now powerful enough that you can zoom all the way back in,"
1355.8,1359.8," and play it over the shoulder, like, mass effect or a coat or."
1359.8,1363.8," Yeah. So, that initial impression though, I mean, at least if you buy it off and glad we'll"
1363.8,1366.8," sire in the book, Blink, yeah, it's pretty important."
1366.8,1373.8," I mean, it might be all someone sees, but it's an initial impression of just like the trailer they show."
1373.8,1375.8," Of course, that doesn't, yeah, that doesn't mean it's any less superficial,"
1375.8,1381.8," but it also means it's no less importantly as far as it's, you know, persuasive power for an audience."
1381.8,1392.8," Well, you could, you could question, by where EA's decision to have that be the first thing they show ever of Dragon Age is a scene that looks like it's totally ripped off from the helm's deep scene,"
1392.8,1397.8," and two towers, you could say, well, maybe you shouldn't have done that because people are going to think you ripped off."
1397.8,1401.8," Lord of the Rings, in fact, I saw the demo this morning with like four of their guys,"
1401.8,1406.8," and as soon as the lights went on from the demo, you know, the first question was,"
1406.8,1412.8," So did this start out as a Lord of the Rings game with EA, and then like you lost the license and decided to do this?"
1412.8,1414.8, So that was a very first question.
1414.8,1417.8," Oh, it's like, no, you fucking dumb shit, dipping it. It's bioware."
1417.8,1421.8," It's like the little germ is asking like, so now that this is quick,"
1421.8,1425.8," it does not mean that comes on three discs. It's like, what?"
1426.8,1430.8, I honestly hurt that once on like you did not. Yes.
1430.8,1434.8," Really? There's some dumb questions. What about you on your end of things, Mark?"
1434.8,1438.8," Well, you know, without, you know, you're not naming names, but yeah, you know what?"
1438.8,1440.8, Give us a dumb question.
1440.8,1444.8, It could have been our questions too. What's the stupidest question someone has?
1444.8,1448.8," Oh, geez, someone asked me this yesterday and I was trying to think about the game."
1448.8,1451.8, We mostly receive pretty good questions.
1451.8,1455.8," We get the same questions, right? I'm asking us like, what are the terms?"
1455.8,1458.8," What's multiplayer all about? Well, we're going to talk about multiplayer later."
1458.8,1462.8," You know, and what about the ternons and what about them?"
1462.8,1469.8," I'm a regular fly, but geez, stupidest questions."
1469.8,1475.8," Something where like after you go, can you believe that guy asks that when you guys are like talking amongst yourself?"
1475.8,1479.8," After that, even when you're still to distract you, I still think if I answer for that,"
1479.8,1482.8, what's the best kind of question that you're unable to answer?
1482.8,1488.8," Obviously, you're unable to answer a whole lot because of the way that, you know, marketing plans go, go for games."
1488.8,1492.8, What's the best question that I'm unable to answer? So that I cannot answer it?
1492.8,1497.8," Well, I mean, yeah, just some, I mean, to give an indication of what you really want to talk about."
1497.8,1501.8," I mean, you will at some point in the future, obviously, but you can't know."
1501.8,1506.8," Yeah, you know, we'd love to talk about multiplayer and, you know, the playable races in the game."
1506.8,1511.8," But this is the thing is, there's only so much information people can take at once, right?"
1511.8,1517.8," If you just like blow your load and just talk about everything, the message gets completely lost and they have no idea what's going on, right?"
1517.8,1525.8," And we're doing a lot of stuff in Don't War too, so we need to slowly release information over time so we can build up anticipation,"
1525.8,1528.8, but also not overwhelm people to much information.
1528.8,1531.8, Eski Ness and another way of covering our ass because there's going to be someone that's listening.
1531.8,1535.8, You got someone on from Don't War and you didn't ask them about multiplayer and you didn't ask them about multiplayer and you didn't ask them about multiplayer.
1535.8,1536.8, You didn't ask them about multiplayer.
1536.8,1537.8, You didn't ask them about multiplayer.
1537.8,1538.8, You didn't ask them about multiplayer.
1538.8,1539.8, You didn't ask them about multiplayer.
1539.8,1541.8, So what's up with the Ternids?
1541.8,1543.8, What's up with that?
1543.8,1548.8," One question, you know, we have had a lot of people asking us about multiplayer this week, obviously, and say,"
1548.8,1552.8," well, we're going to talk about a bit later, but the one thing we can't say, and you guys have probably heard about this,"
1552.8,1558.8, is that Don't War 2 is going to be games from Windows Live title with fully free multiplayer across the board.
1558.8,1563.8," So achievements, leader boards, voice chat, everything, you know, the whole kid and Kavoodle,"
1563.8,1567.8," I just said, getting to the little person on this point."
1567.8,1568.8," Yeah, totally."
1568.8,1570.8, So it's fully free multiplayer.
1570.8,1574.8," So you know, your current gamer tag that you're using, you'll be using it on War 2 and your achievements are going to build up."
1574.8,1580.8," And you know, you'll be talking to your buddies who are playing Halo 3 and you'll send them an invite and they'll come and play it."
1580.8,1586.8, And I think it's just awesome if you're joining that huge multiplayer community and we're really excited about that.
1586.8,1589.8, Is it that huge of a community though on PC on on?
1590.8,1595.8," Well, it's a, you know, I don't really believe there are PC gamers, you know, who just play PC games, right?"
1595.8,1597.8, I think there's a huge overlap.
1597.8,1603.8," And I think, you know, hopefully with games like Don't War 2, you know, exclusively on PC and using games from Windows Live,"
1603.8,1607.8," you're going to see a lot more people, you know, PC gamers on games from Windows Live."
1607.8,1609.8, Was that a difficult agreement to come to?
1609.8,1616.8," I mean, because I have some developers that have spoken to, it seems like they wanted distance itself from it because they associate bad press with it."
1616.8,1621.8," Other times it seems naturally attractive to, you know, affiliate yourself with Microsoft because you're in it."
1621.8,1631.8," Yeah, you know, like we were certainly aware of the bad press is receiving the pass, but we think with all that press was because there was this gold seller split, right?"
1631.8,1635.8, And there were the have and the have nots and what people were used to that on PC gaming.
1635.8,1641.8," So, and, you know, all I can say is that Don't War 2, it's going to be free."
1641.8,1648.8," So, I think the publicity for us is going to be good because we're going to have, you know, extremely stable connections."
1648.8,1655.8," I'm players going to be able to match well, you know, it's going to scale super well to, you know, if we get millions of people playing online, it's going to work, right?"
1655.8,1657.8," And so, that's awesome."
1657.8,1660.8," I mean, you know, you're not going to, I don't know, maybe you will cop to it."
1660.8,1666.8," I mean, clearly there's some online, you know, connectivity issues with whatever the solution is for company heroes."
1666.8,1668.8," Yeah, you know, is that a way around that?"
1668.8,1678.8," Yeah, like we've, you know, really important to us and we're going to continue to support it with, you know, comedy heroes and, you know, it posing for us and then any other content that we release in the future."
1678.8,1688.8," But with Don't War 2, we wanted to come up with a solution that would connect us to a really large community of gamers, you know, millions of gamers and games from their lives was the best way to do that."
1688.8,1695.8," All right, so are you going to be, I mean, you mean, Don't War 2, the sort of poster child for the revised GFW live?"
1695.8,1706.8," Well, we should have, you know, I don't know. We, you know, I don't know where Microsoft's other plans, but you know, we'd love to be the poster child if I want to make it, make us the poster child."
1706.8,1711.8," Because it was like, you know, Gears of War was going to, well, kind of, I don't know. I mean, it's got a weird history, Shadow Run out."
1711.8,1720.8," Hey, look, we're going to, you know, Gears of War was like, well, no, here's a bunch of ports so far, but this is like, I think the first really, truly high profile, you see them the game."
1720.8,1725.8," I think what, it's probably the first PC only Xbox Live, you know, thanks for when it was live games."
1725.8,1726.8," Yeah, right."
1726.8,1731.8," Because the other ones are across, more, more, more on both platforms, right? So maybe if you really succeed,"
1731.8,1734.8," well, this and it goes well, then we can get our magazine back."
1734.8,1739.8," Maybe, you know, yeah, you should be spending everything on us, you know, look, we're not on a pressure already."
1739.8,1740.8, You're three million fans. Yeah.
1740.8,1741.8, Microsoft.
1741.8,1742.3, Three million.
1742.3,1743.8," You know, it's a happy and things like tear nids and stuff."
1743.8,1746.8," Yeah, it's so good and games from one of those live, so great."
1746.8,1747.8, Now we want that official magazine back.
1747.8,1749.8," Just, just so I get this right."
1749.8,1753.8," Vanessa, you, you were whispering that you're, your time is up, right?"
1753.8,1754.8, Okay.
1754.8,1755.8, I do get it.
1755.8,1756.8," Yeah, they have to go."
1756.8,1758.8, So Mark has got other other obligations.
1758.8,1760.8, I know he's so important.
1760.8,1761.8, I'm sorry.
1761.8,1762.8, He's got some.
1762.8,1765.8," Thanks for, thanks so much for being here guys."
1765.8,1770.8," I just wanted, last thing I wanted to say was, we do have an Eldar trailer coming out later."
1770.8,1771.8, So that's got to be fully fully loaded.
1771.8,1773.8, It should be coming out tonight.
1773.8,1776.8," So, you know, get to see the race lord doing some, you know, blood painting out as"
1776.8,1777.8, on guys.
1777.8,1778.8," So, okay."
1778.8,1780.8," So, if you have any idea, keep your eyes open for that."
1780.8,1784.8, And we will continue to follow your game as you work on it because we are big fans of
1784.8,1785.8, Relic and of the Donor series.
1785.8,1786.8, Thanks for starting.
1786.8,1787.8, Thanks guys.
1787.8,1788.8, Thank you.
1788.8,1789.8, Thank you.
1789.8,1790.8, I'm sorry.
1790.8,1791.8, I'm going to get it.

1817.8,1820.8, And we're back.
1820.8,1823.8," So, thanks again to Mark."
1823.8,1826.8, I think we're actually not going to pocket so much longer here because we have to
1826.8,1830.8," hustle off to the airport and before that, we each have to write like 20 more previews."
1830.8,1831.8," So, we'll do this."
1831.8,1832.8," Oh, it's very coverage."
1832.8,1833.8," But, John, Ellie, do you want to say it?"
1833.8,1835.8," We can say, Rave and play Doom though."
1835.8,1836.8, What for one last hour?
1836.8,1837.8," Oh, yeah."
1837.8,1838.8, On the plane.
1838.8,1839.8, You know what?
1839.8,1842.8, I've already been thinking that my Batman Penn Light's probably going to be awesome on the
1842.8,1843.8, Virginia.
1843.8,1844.8," Oh, my."
1844.8,1845.8," Oh, shit."
1845.8,1846.8," Yeah, a whistle too."
1846.8,1848.8, Go with it.
1848.8,1851.8, I just wanted to kill the pizza throw or joke yet again.
1851.8,1854.8," Yeah, because that shit isn't played out enough."
1854.8,1857.8," But it was like, no, because when we're going to dinner the night, we're talking about Ryan's"
1857.8,1861.8, got sort of odd dietary habits limited palate.
1861.8,1862.8, Right.
1862.8,1865.8," He, we've mentioned before in the show, he'll eat peanut merjolly sandwiches."
1865.8,1870.8," If you go to Chipotle, look at the case of Dia, which isn't technically on their menu, but"
1870.8,1871.8, he's just case of him.
1871.8,1873.8," He, he, he'll tell them to make it."
1873.8,1875.8," It's just, you know, meat and cheese and nothing else."
1875.8,1876.8, I'll think there's no sauce.
1876.8,1878.8," He, there's a story I tell."
1878.8,1881.8," It's not true, but I tell people that like about the time when he tried."
1881.8,1888.8," We can bits and the tried talk about mild, mild sauce and how he did it at the hospital."
1888.8,1890.8," But, but so that's basically his palate."
1890.8,1894.8," The next Thai food though, but with no vegetables or anything in it, I don't know."
1894.8,1896.8, I just know that he likes going to the Thai place next to you.
1896.8,1898.8," But yeah, but try and try to just like, chicken and rice."
1898.8,1902.8," Yeah, he'll get something with no vegetables or anything or spice or anything."
1902.8,1907.8," So it's like, isn't it, it's not tiny, or it just becomes rice and like a meat."
1907.8,1908.8, Yeah.
1908.8,1909.8, Yeah.
1909.8,1913.8," So the easiest way, instead of taking all the time that it took us to just basically the scribe is"
1913.8,1919.8," Pow, it can really, to rule a thumb when you're going to have food and Ryan's guts with you and you're trying to figure out."
1919.8,1926.8, Can we go here instead of having any real process of elimination just as you so with a teenage man in just turtles use this as ammunition.
1926.8,1931.8," And if the answer is no, then the answer is no for the food."
1931.8,1934.8, That's it.
1934.8,1936.8, I think that holds up.
1936.8,1937.8," Yeah, I'm trying to back see."
1937.8,1939.8," Yeah, no, but also the theory."
1939.8,1942.8," I think if I go through the food group, it's your right."
1942.8,1947.8," Yeah, if they, if they wouldn't shoot that shit at whatever rock steady and bebop, he's not."
1947.8,1948.8, He won't eat it.
1948.8,1949.8, Yep.
1949.8,1950.8, All right.
1950.8,1951.8, That might be it for.
1951.8,1952.8, I have to be it for.
1952.8,1954.8," Yeah, I don't know what to say to that."
1954.8,1956.8," Anything else, good or no."
1956.8,1957.8, All right.
1957.8,1958.8, Are we done?
1958.8,1959.8, That's it.
1959.8,1960.8, That's it.
1960.8,1961.8, Pete's closed.
1961.8,1962.8, Next week will be back.
1962.8,1964.8, Ryan's not really fired by the way.
1964.8,1968.8," Since people never understand anything on the internet, I'm just going to say it."
1968.8,1970.8, I don't want him to be a gaff thread or whatever.
1970.8,1971.8," Oh, and we were just joking."
1971.8,1973.8, I'm sure about some of the stuff we said in our last podcast.
1973.8,1976.8," We should clarify that because we've been like, oh, yeah."
1976.8,1977.8, What do we need to apologize for?
1977.8,1983.8," We've basically been the dogs who were sitting in a living room full of, you know, a"
1983.8,1989.3999999999999, postry stuffing and just shredded paper and all this stuff and waiting for the master to come
1989.3999999999999,1990.8, home and see what we've done.
1990.8,1993.8, But we've just been just joking though.
1993.8,1997.8," When we were telling people just to click anything on the site, we just have to act on the"
1997.8,1998.8, site.
1998.8,1999.8, But we want you to read it.
1999.8,2002.8, We want you to click on it because you can't wait to read it.
2002.8,2003.8, That's what we really meant.
2003.8,2004.8, Right.
2004.8,2005.8, We do.
2005.8,2009.8, We want you to read the articles that we wrote and we want and not in a cynical way.
2009.8,2010.8, No.
2010.8,2013.8, We're proud of what we do at 1Up.com.
2013.8,2015.8, And on that we will see you again next week.
