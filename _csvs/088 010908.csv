30.0,42.4, it is and it would come to a GFW radio podcast can you or that I don't know what that is I've done that before it never means anything
42.4,55.519999999999996, January 8 2008 and we are the MSG staff of Game Surrendos the Official Magazine here podcasting for your oral pleasure
55.52,60.52, so you name say your name I'm Jeff Green.
60.52,61.52, Brian Scott?
61.52,62.52, This is Sean Malloy.
62.52,69.80000000000001, Sean Elliot the MSG part is because we just had lunch it just placed called B&M it's a Chinese restaurant
69.80000000000001,72.52000000000001, and yes we're the appropriate for the name.
72.52000000000001,75.52000000000001, The appropriate name is not lost on us.
75.52000000000001,79.52000000000001, This place has a story and it's that it's right down the street.
79.52,85.11999999999999, For whatever reason certain people in the building love it to the point where you know electronic gaming
85.11999999999999,91.82, monthly is the end of the show and chain bet house and once 8 there for two weeks straight every day of the work week
91.82,95.52, that's probably around the time they gave Halo 3 a 10.
95.52,100.52, Everything in there is the exact same shade of like dude who butter brown.
100.52,107.52, You look at it and you're like okay whatever it's about you and even though even on the way back to
108.52,112.52, our office to eat it you know I was telling stories and I was getting everyone psyched up to eat it by saying
112.52,118.52, how like I'll see some of our favorite local bomb is the one who looks like he's rolled around under a car with a leaking oil pan
118.52,125.52, and who will I've seen him laying on the sidewalk eating you know kind of like on the side with one arm just like laying
125.52,131.51999999999998, laying over his hip and the other arm up up over his head and he's using that arm to form his
131.52,137.52, shitty fingers into a shovel and to just plunge into the the doggy box whatever those are called in
137.52,141.52, and just basically shoveled the gosh out of there into his mouth.
141.52,150.52, So I've seen this many times and when I when I look at the food in our bucket like that's the same stuff you know
150.52,154.52, this is what the answer one has lots of people like when we went there there were a lot of people eating in there
154.52,156.52, lots of normal looking people.
156.52,159.52," No, but it bumps like it does good business."
159.52,160.52," Oh, okay."
160.52,161.52, That shit is bomb.
161.52,163.52, It's for the it's for the bare videos.
163.52,165.52," For the batch yeah, that's the process."
165.52,168.52, That television not facing the people eating in the restaurant.
168.52,170.52, It was facing those waiting in line.
170.52,172.52, While you're waiting for your food.
172.52,176.52, So when you're some bears for an occasion then we go back to eat it.
176.52,177.52, Yeah.
177.52,181.52, And we're you know I'm sitting there eating mine and of course then you know in addition to the
181.52,188.52, bombs and everything the usual I'm like okay it's like you hit a pig with an RPG scooped up put it under a heat lamp and then all the
188.52,193.52, heech like whatever was any bucket on on tray of a different variety.
193.52,199.52, So I'm eating this and the first piece of chicken I go for is just this rock hard.
199.52,204.52, You know you're seeing that when someone fucked up with Thanksgiving turkey and the outside it's like just this
204.52,208.52, desiccated husk and inside it's hollowed out and split open.
208.52,214.52, Somehow my piece of sweet and sour chicken had replicated that phenomenon on an in a microcosm.
214.52,220.52, So I pulled that out the very first act of eating this lunch was to pull this thing out and dump it in the trash can.
220.52,222.52, Two more bites in it was all connective tissue.
222.52,224.52, Send you ligaments and loves in you.
224.52,232.52, Then I got a piece of either extremely overcooked rice or like a fragment of bone or something.
232.52,240.52, I mean and then I threw so few at on and on it goes in and you know two more bites and then I just took the whole thing and I put it in the trash can.
240.52,246.52, But even though three bites was enough of a dose of MSG you told me it's not me out.
246.52,252.52, So Sean needs two years at it and yeah I couldn't compare it after a couple bites of each type.
252.52,253.52, Right there identical.
253.52,255.52, This place used to be good.
255.52,259.52, I have fun told you I find memories of when he tastes is all.
259.52,260.52, That's true.
260.52,261.52, I love standards.
261.52,262.52, This cheese.
262.52,264.52, When when was it good?
264.52,265.52, I did.
265.52,269.52, In the mid 90s it was good.
269.52,272.52, Which was a long time ago.
272.52,279.52, So we're working on our games of the year feature right now in the magazine.
279.52,281.52, We've casted our votes.
281.52,283.52, The votes are in.
283.52,284.52, We know the winners.
284.52,286.52, We know the issues.
287.52,290.52, And we're not sharing them with you now.
290.52,291.52, Good.
291.52,292.52, Next topic.
292.52,294.52, No.
294.52,296.52, What do we want to tie?
296.52,297.52, We're all fun.
297.52,298.52, Good discussion.
298.52,304.52, I thought last week when we were talking about the artistic direction stuff on team fortitude versus
304.52,309.52, fire shock until we got cut off by those motherfuckers that I want up yours.
309.52,311.52, So now we got to.
311.52,315.52, I want to sort of pick that up again and maybe go over some of the issues we are looking at.
315.52,323.52, And coming with our coming to our award decisions such as they are.
323.52,325.52," Well, we did talk a bit about some of that."
325.52,328.52, A level design was an issue.
328.52,333.52, And I talked about how both stalker and crisis did out to me in that department.
333.52,336.52, But then we also overlooked half like two episodes to.
336.52,340.52, With a level designs altogether different.
340.52,342.52," It's, um, I don't know."
342.52,343.52, It works so well.
343.52,345.52," I mean, it's just again."
345.52,350.52, We've read varieties been a theme among all of our favorite games of the year this year.
350.52,352.52," Um, most of them."
352.52,356.52," Exception of portal, which is pretty much straight, you know, you're doing the same things"
356.52,357.52, entire time through.
357.52,360.52, But with half life two episode two.
360.52,362.52," I mean, at least for me."
362.52,367.52, The pacing of the activities that you're doing.
367.52,370.52, And then also just the way that you move through levels is good.
370.52,376.52," So even though, I mean, even though it's a largely linear game, I mean, all games are"
376.52,378.52," Linear, some, you know, in some capacity."
378.52,384.52, And we talk about the the the breadth of the between the rails is wider and some game is then it is
384.52,385.52, another.
385.52,390.52, But what have like two episode two does so well is that it just makes you forget about the rails sometimes.
390.52,392.52, It pushes you through.
392.52,396.52, It pushes you along the rails so well that you're not really paying attention to.
396.52,398.52, These are the exact dimensions of this level.
398.52,404.52," I think for me, this is kind of abstract, but in the worst case, I don't know if everyone thinks this way."
404.52,408.52," Maybe, you know, readers have to, I mean, listeners always say that listeners and readers."
408.52,409.52, Hopefully you do both.
409.52,411.52, We'll have to write in and let us know.
411.52,419.52," But when you're playing games with the exceptionally poor level design, you're able to visualize in your head what the map actually looks like."
419.52,423.52," So like if you're able to take like a free floating cam, right, going to no clip."
423.52,424.52, Yep.
424.52,425.52, And pop yourself up above the map.
425.52,431.52, You already know what this schematic of it and you just feel like you're going through this rat maze where.
431.52,437.52," Whereas with half life, just because of the scripting involved and just by keeping it interesting the whole time."
437.52,441.52," I'm never stopping to say, oh, here's what this like winding path looks like."
441.52,444.52, These are the exact contour dimensions of it.
444.52,446.52," And I mean, I get some of the variety there."
446.52,453.52, There's that be the level design where you're using a vehicle and a bridge as a puzzle where it's basically this.
453.52,459.52," You have the seesaw mechanic and you move objects around on this massive scale because it's a giant car bridge, right?"
459.52,461.52, Just a vehicle bridge.
461.52,467.52," And you're so instead of, you know, getting a stick to move up it in angle so that you can then run up it and jump over a ledge."
467.52,472.52, You're actually using it on this giant scale to leap a car over a chasm.
472.52,479.52," Yeah, I think that those those those puzzles the physics makes puzzles and even the non physics space ones do help."
479.52,489.52," They help with that. I think they help break up the rail feeling because for a little while there, you're forced to stop and think on your own."
489.52,493.52, You have to come to your own conclusions about how this thing is going to move.
493.52,499.52," How do I get across this bridge? You know, it's not like press the, you know, press the e button to move the bridge."
499.52,503.52, Right. You have to physically do something to make this work.
503.52,510.52," And it's just there. I mean, the only, the only hints are just there in the way that the environment is constructed."
510.52,515.52," Sometimes a character might say something, but not even in that case, no one's yelling at you."
515.52,519.52," Have you tried doing this? You know, like they will in other games."
519.52,520.52, Right.
520.52,522.52," And if you notice at that point, because loose."
522.52,525.52, Yeah. Yeah. They just have to do it.
526.52,541.52," You work on it into the point where they're confident that most people will look at everything in front of them and say, these are the tools I have. I have a car. I have a gravity gun with with which I can move objects objects, you know, weight registers in this world."
541.52,545.52," And so let's figure it out. And then, you know, that comes together just so well."
545.52,549.52, That's one of the things about valid games is.
549.52,555.52," I was thinking about this the other day because movies when you hear that a movie was focused, tested, you immediately just like turned off by that."
555.52,561.52," Just like, oh, that means like they changed the ending because it was too big people thought that, you know, it was too sad or something."
561.52,569.52," But when in the cases like a valid game when you know that they're really, really trying this out with so many different people like then result is great."
569.52,572.52, Yeah. It's like the opposite for video games that just is for movies.
572.52,577.52," In the case, the worst case in a movie, they'll just take it all of a sudden, they'll throw a flashback in."
577.52,587.52," You're like, that's some shit I saw 30 minutes ago. Like I like who's in this theater going, oh, that's why this guy's pissed off because this guy killed his brother."
587.52,590.52," Right. You know, so a lot of the other minor voice over."
590.52,597.52," How that same effect. What's the later on, right? It's a classic example of a movie that got bound by focused text testing."
597.52,606.52," Yeah. And so a lot of game, I mean, you want to address it. If you test something and you see that like 50% of your audience isn't getting it."
606.52,614.52, You've got to do something about it. But what Valvo always does is just work at it and try to find a solution that doesn't.
614.52,623.52," That's not going to strike the people who are maybe a little bit more a student, more perceptive as they'll, the Valvo just slapping them in the face with it."
623.52,633.52," And it seems so easy to do that. The biggest example of course is in, you know, perfect dark zero where they really say, if you stand there for too long, then they just draw a big jump."
633.52,637.52, And I think there was a pyramid on the ground. A tension dumbass.
637.52,648.52," Yeah. Exactly. Here's your path. And you know what I hate it does that, by the way. I hate that that bejeweled does that. Can I just say,"
648.52,651.52," Oh, and after a certain amount of time, it will highlight the gym. Yeah."
651.52,654.52," That you can do. Yeah. It's like, come on. This game isn't that hard."
654.52,656.52, Give me a chance. I am proud to say.
656.52,657.52, I'm going to say to the blue jam.
657.52,662.52," There are times though when it's done that and I've gone like, how did I not see that?"
662.52,669.52," Yeah. I've been thankful for it because clearly to get to the point where it's flashing, you really have to be staring at it that long."
669.52,673.52," So it's like, it's not like that was obvious because if it were obvious you'd have fucking did."
673.52,681.52," I guess you're right. Okay. And so for me, it doesn't matter in the jewel because it's a game about connecting three gyms."
681.52,688.52," So when they throw, it's already artificial and carnage. So you can't throw a little more on there and change it."
688.52,696.52," When you put those arrows on the floor, it's safe. You've spent gotten us three months working on a level to make it seem like a place that you can exist in,"
696.52,701.52," you know, in the content in a world with meaning. And then all of a sudden you're like, well, by the way,"
701.52,704.52, this is just a bunch of boxes and you're supposed to move through them and you're not moving through them.
704.52,707.52, So we're going to tell you how to get through them.
707.52,712.52, The stakes are much different and it's just completely demolished all of that work.
712.52,718.52, That's why the valves games are so awesome because they're to me. They're so brilliantly tuned. The entire half-life series.
718.52,724.52," Yeah, you know, they're tuned to the point where sometimes you get a little stuck, but it's always a logical."
724.52,728.52, It's always an in-game logical answer to how to get to that next place.
728.52,731.52, There are those classic examples that I talked a lot about the grenade.
731.52,737.52, Because we were sort of trying to honor the fact that people had to play the game the time.
737.52,739.52, So I talked about using a grenade to jump.
739.52,747.52, And a lot of people ended up reading that as a grenade jump like in a team fortress or a quake where you throw a grenade and just jump on the grenade itself.
747.52,753.52," And of course the puzzle I was talking about was there was actually, it was like an oil changing booth or something."
753.52,760.52," You throw the grenade into the pit and then you use your gravity going to push the big metal grate over it and you stand on the grate,"
760.52,762.52, which then acts as a trebuchet and launches you.
762.52,765.52, And I thought that was actually one of the trickier puzzles in that game.
765.52,774.52," And that one was optional too. You could tell that they thought the same and you could tell that they're testing probably proved that it was trickier because it was one that you could say,"
774.52,778.52, I don't need to do this. I can't figure this out. I'm going to keep going.
778.52,782.52, Really? I thought you needed to do that to like open a door or something that you needed.
782.52,784.52," Is to get the rocket launcher? Oh, that's all it was?"
784.52,785.52," Yeah, okay."
785.52,791.52," But it was awesome. And like again, the examples there were that there were scorch marks all right metal great."
791.52,799.52, The hints were there. There's a get guy hanging in the rafters with more scorch marks near him and you know grenade laying around there's a grenade box in there.
799.52,809.52," And actually if you look at the commentary for that section, they were saying how you know the way that you get into this room is going through this little car."
809.52,817.52, You have to crouch off your car. And that's there to prevent you from bringing a bunch of objects and painstakingly creating a ladder to jump on.
817.52,823.52," But people still found ways to get objects in. And that's how they saw the puzzle, which was really weird."
823.52,828.52," But yeah, they just do that so well. Then of course, at the end, they actually, you know, talking about where you"
828.52,839.52," can visualize the specific contours and dimensions of a map. They actually reveal that to you at the end by having maps on the walls and characters pointed out and say, look at this. This is where you're going."
839.52,846.52," And that's because of course, those sections of the game are less linear. You can move around them in whatever ways you want."
846.52,856.52," But again, instead of pausing the game, throwing up a screen that says, here's what you're going to do is just another organic solution. You have someone in the world say, here's a map."
856.52,860.52, Here's where all our safe houses are at. Go through it this way.
860.52,866.52, That was awesome. Portal had kind of some of the same stuff at the end. We're like sort of the era.
866.52,872.52," Sure, right. The arrows pointing you, which a big help. Yeah, in a chamber was in 19."
872.52,882.52, Is that what? Was. Yeah. We do want to talk about both portal and half like two without any concern about spoiling the game.
882.52,892.52," So telling around it right now, what we're going to do is at the end of this show provided someone doesn't come and kick us out is do that. And we'll just issue a warning that we're going in this boiler zone."
892.52,902.52," Right. So if you want to hear half, five, two episodes and portal spoilers, they're coming at the end of this podcast. So hang on. And if you don't want to hear them."
902.52,911.52," Go away. We'll give you a fair warning. Yeah. Before we move on to some predictions for you know, face a PC gaming in 2008 and then also some of the games that we anticipate."
911.52,921.52, Anyone have any game of the year item that they haven't been able to talk about that didn't win an award per say.
921.52,925.52," Yeah, I think we could do that. I mean, if you have one from the same."
925.52,927.52, Puzzle Quest.
927.52,929.52," Yeah, right."
929.52,933.52," Yeah, right. Lobbing for puzzle questions. One came up in the meetings speaking of the jewel puzzle quest."
933.52,937.52," It's well, the way Sean put it. It's been jumbled with Nana."
937.52,945.52," Well, so isn't that is what it is? It's, I mean, you know, boil anything down to something like that, but right of course."
945.52,946.52," Just like you could say, I don't know."
946.52,947.52, I don't know.
947.52,948.52, I don't know.
948.52,950.52, I would do that. That's so reductive.
950.52,952.52, That's not too sticked.
952.52,953.52, But wait.
953.52,958.52," Okay. So how is it? Yeah. How is that more than, yeah, how is it more than but you."
958.52,959.52, What's with me?
959.52,960.52, So me.
960.52,965.52," Well, I mean, you know, ultimately, you know, match three, you're matching three colored gems."
965.52,968.52, And that's what that's what the main game players.
968.52,969.52, Okay. So a bit jeweled.
969.52,970.52, Right.
970.52,974.52, But it's wrapped in like sort of like this whole huge kind of RPG thing.
974.52,975.52," Man, so man."
975.52,976.52, Hold on.
976.52,978.52, Why do you guys shut the hell up?
978.52,980.52, I can't.
980.52,981.52," Ryan, your assholes."
981.52,982.52, Go ahead.
982.52,985.52," Well, no, I mean, like, you know, you start the game off."
985.52,986.52, You're picking a character class.
986.52,988.52, You've got this huge fancy map.
988.52,991.52, It's sort of got like these kind of like fire and bloom kind of.
991.52,992.52, Okay.
992.52,993.52, I'm stopping you.
993.52,995.52, Does the character class actually do anything?
995.52,996.52, Yes.
996.52,997.52, Okay.
997.52,1001.52," The character classes, like, you know, you level up a character by like the way that the"
1001.52,1006.52, the jeweled sort of levels are framed is like you're fighting these monsters.
1006.52,1012.52," So, I mean, like you're, you're kind of racing to to plead the other guys hit points."
1012.52,1014.52," And you, you level up."
1014.52,1017.52, You gain like new spells based on your class.
1017.52,1020.52," All the gems, the colorful gems that you're matching kind of a quite different color."
1020.52,1023.52," You're going to have to get a different color of mana, which you need to cast your spells."
1023.52,1025.52," Like for example, what's a spell?"
1025.52,1028.52," For example, my, my, I was your character."
1028.52,1030.52, Can I spell?
1030.52,1032.52, And he has a fireball spell.
1032.52,1039.52," Like the dumb, which it'll, you pick a three by three grid of gems and it'll destroy all of those at once."
1039.52,1045.52," So, you know, instead of like the way that you do damage to these monsters that you're fighting,"
1045.52,1047.52," is there, there are like these skull gems."
1047.52,1049.52, You line up three skulls and that does damage.
1049.52,1050.52, Right.
1050.52,1053.52," Basically, it's like, you know, you go into a combat."
1053.52,1055.52, It's a one-on-one combat with another enemy.
1055.52,1058.52," That, that enemy is basically playing bajool against you."
1058.52,1059.52, Right.
1059.52,1066.52," And you are, but by doing different combinations of three, you either, like if you get three red gems together,"
1066.52,1068.52, that will increase your red mana.
1068.52,1071.52, And then you use your red mana to cast a fireball.
1071.52,1073.52, There's something to note here though.
1073.52,1078.52, And this isn't saying that puzzle puzzles any less remarkable because another game did this first.
1078.52,1082.52," But, you know, Bookworm Adventures from last year was fantastic."
1082.52,1085.52, That's what we really got to be in the mind was the story of the story there.
1085.52,1086.52, There's some similarities.
1086.52,1087.52, Yeah.
1087.52,1088.52, There's some similarity.
1088.52,1089.52, That's a word game.
1089.52,1091.52, This is not a match three game.
1091.52,1092.52, This is a color game.
1092.52,1094.52, I'm sure Bookworm is a good one.
1094.52,1095.52, It's quite fun.
1095.52,1096.52, It's quite fun.
1096.52,1097.52, It's quite fun.
1097.52,1098.52, It's quite fun.
1098.52,1099.52, It's quite fun.
1099.52,1100.52, It's quite fun.
1100.52,1101.52, It's quite fun.
1101.52,1102.52, It's quite fun.
1102.52,1104.52, It's very fun.
1104.52,1105.52, I agree with Ryan.
1105.52,1107.52," And so, but, you know, you've got this map and you're doing all these quests."
1107.52,1110.52, There's like this whole city element.
1110.52,1113.52," You'll like, you have this city, you build all these structures."
1113.52,1115.52, You capture monsters.
1115.52,1116.52, You research their skills.
1116.52,1117.52, You get more spells.
1117.52,1118.52, Okay.
1118.52,1119.52, That's more than mana.
1119.52,1120.52," You know, yeah."
1120.52,1121.52, It is.
1121.52,1122.52," No, it is."
1122.52,1123.52, It's not left.
1123.52,1124.52, I think that's more than mana.
1124.52,1125.52, You've made your case.
1125.52,1126.52," No, I'm on your side."
1126.52,1127.52, Yeah.
1127.52,1129.52," And so, that Ryan, that was on your top 10."
1129.52,1130.52, I did.
1130.52,1133.52," And I kind of, I keyed into it like over the Christmas break."
1133.52,1136.52, So it was kind of like a late surprise.
1136.52,1137.52, A few years ago.
1137.52,1139.52," I was like, I can't remember when I was a kid."
1139.52,1142.52," I was like, I can't remember when I was a kid."
1142.52,1144.52," I was like, I can't remember when I was a kid."
1144.52,1148.52," I was like, you know, I'm a year, which, you know, I told all you guys about it."
1148.52,1151.52, So I don't know if any of you guys have turned it really well.
1151.52,1152.52, But this is not for the dead.
1152.52,1153.52," The DS and PSP, right?"
1153.52,1154.52, This isn't.
1154.52,1155.52, Right.
1155.52,1156.52, So.
1156.52,1157.52, It's not exclusively a PC game.
1157.52,1160.52," It's also, I believe, there's an Xbox Live Arcade version."
1160.52,1163.52, Seems like I picked the DS version up.
1163.52,1164.52, It sounds like that's perfect for that.
1164.52,1168.52, I don't know if it has like different levels of stuff.
1168.52,1184.52," By the way, when you were talking about half-fifth episode two as possible, winter for, for level design I was sicking peggle."
1184.52,1186.52, For level design?
1186.52,1187.52, Yeah.
1187.52,1188.52, Yeah.
1188.52,1192.52, Yeah.
1192.52,1193.52, Sure.
1193.52,1202.52," Because, you know, like, with every level, you get one of those, or every few, all of those, he get like one of those new cool animals."
1202.52,1203.52, Right.
1203.52,1204.52," Like, you get clawed the front line."
1204.52,1207.52," It's a processor design to, to."
1207.52,1210.52," And then, like, the level looks like a clown face."
1210.52,1211.52, They don't.
1211.52,1212.52, They don't.
1212.52,1213.52, They don't.
1213.52,1214.52, I think they're so cool.
1214.52,1219.52," They're also designed to maximize the use of, I know you'd be in for seizures."
1219.52,1220.52, I have.
1220.52,1228.52," But let me try to, like, you're not, to use, to maximize the use of the special ability that comes along with each new animal character."
1228.52,1233.52," And that's part of the problem though, when you play multiplayer and you each pick a different creator."
1233.52,1239.52," But then, depending on the map, you pick, it's like, well, if the map was made for, you know, the,"
1239.52,1246.52," which on the wall, or with the, you know, with the two balls split, then it's like, you, of course, you want to pick him."
1246.52,1247.52, Right.
1247.52,1248.52, There are a few exceptions.
1248.52,1249.52," Like, just end balls."
1249.52,1250.52, Good.
1250.52,1253.52," Regardless, but there's ones where, like, the flippers completely useless on that one."
1253.52,1255.52," The flippers, he's useless most of the time."
1255.52,1256.52, That's the French guy.
1256.52,1258.52, That's the French lobster clawed.
1258.52,1259.52, Yeah.
1259.52,1263.52," When you get that, when you, when you're playing multiplayer and it's your turn and your stuck, because I would do that."
1263.52,1264.52, We play random.
1264.52,1266.52," That would be the thing, pick a random character."
1266.52,1268.52, And you can stuck with him and so you get your power up.
1268.52,1270.52," And then you don't even, you're sitting there."
1270.52,1274.52," Because there's that, though, yeah, and the flippers, you're like, don't even hit it."
1274.52,1275.52, Sad.
1275.52,1276.52, Right.
1276.52,1277.52, Makes me upset.
1277.52,1280.52," I never could get my head around the Zen guy, ironically."
1280.52,1282.52, I was never at one with the Zen guy.
1282.52,1287.52," It's basically just gives you, like, as close to a perfect shot as possible."
1287.52,1292.52," I mean, it'll take your shot and make it much better by, you know, say, for example, like,"
1292.52,1296.52," time you play, you want to get a pink one to multiply your score."
1296.52,1297.52, You want to touch pink.
1297.52,1300.52," Remember that, bring it back to the other place."
1300.52,1305.52," And so if your shot was in such a way that after the first bounce, it wasn't going to touch pink."
1305.52,1309.52," Then, you know, this will make it so you touch pink and maybe, you know, get a big combo."
1309.52,1311.52, And it's generally a really good power up.
1311.52,1314.52, I just played this again from beginning to end this weekend.
1314.52,1316.52, The hell's that?
1316.52,1318.52, Sounds like a solid phone.
1318.52,1319.52," What's it, my?"
1319.52,1320.52, Maybe.
1320.52,1321.52, But it's not the best.
1321.52,1322.52, Okay.
1322.52,1323.52, I saw this weekend.
1323.52,1324.52, I found it.
1324.52,1325.52, I learned to love the dragon.
1325.52,1327.52, I hadn't loved him before.
1327.52,1329.52, He's good on the fireball.
1329.52,1331.52, The whole key with him is you got to angle it.
1331.52,1333.52, You don't want to just waste it by shooting it down.
1333.52,1336.52," You want to hit the trampoline at the bottom, too, that it makes."
1336.52,1337.52, Right.
1337.52,1338.52, Exactly.
1338.52,1339.52, I'll point out now.
1339.52,1341.52, There's no man in this game.
1341.52,1342.52, No man in peggle.
1342.52,1343.52, No.
1343.52,1344.52," So, neither still."
1344.52,1347.52," For, to transition into stuff we're looking for to this year."
1347.52,1348.52," Wait, no."
1348.52,1350.52, This is on the list.
1350.52,1351.52, Tag on it.
1351.52,1352.52, Definitely.
1352.52,1353.52, What?
1353.52,1354.52, What?
1354.52,1355.52, It's different about it.
1355.52,1356.52, Do we know anything about peggle nights?
1356.52,1357.52, It's got one new character.
1357.52,1358.52, This is the problem.
1358.52,1360.52, This is the problem with peggle nights.
1360.52,1361.52, I don't know.
1361.52,1362.52, Okay.
1362.52,1363.52, The list of new features.
1363.52,1366.52," Of course, it's all new puzzles and new character."
1366.52,1368.52," It's like, you need to do more than that."
1368.52,1369.52, I think.
1369.52,1370.52, From what?
1370.52,1372.52," Again, I haven't played it, but just looking at the feature set."
1372.52,1374.52, It kind of comes up wanting.
1374.52,1375.52," You see, why not?"
1375.52,1377.52, Eight more characters.
1377.52,1381.52," Or why not, you know, some cooperative where you're both two people are playing"
1381.52,1383.52, the exact same time to do something.
1383.52,1385.52," I mean, just throw new things in there."
1385.52,1389.52," Is it like like, like, if you're doing this or nights like the round table?"
1389.52,1391.52, The evening nights like the evening.
1391.52,1393.52," Or they're peggle adventures, you know?"
1393.52,1394.52, Do that.
1394.52,1395.52, Peggle adventures.
1395.52,1396.52, That's good.
1396.52,1397.52, If I go with my Anna.
1397.52,1398.52, Yeah.
1398.52,1400.52, That's the sequel for every good puzzle game you make.
1400.52,1403.52," That's kind of a stealth challenge, I think."
1403.52,1406.52," You know, as you went up, I mean, it's a pretty easy game."
1406.52,1411.52," I mean, any game where the entire interface is one mouse click is not, you know, overly challenging."
1411.52,1415.52," However, you know, at the end there, you had to really think out your shots."
1415.52,1416.52, Mm-hmm.
1416.52,1421.52, So what I would have like for what I'm hoping for peggle nights is that there's a little more challenging
1421.52,1423.52, right from the get go.
1423.52,1430.52," They let us, you know, experienced peggle veterans have a challenge right off the bat."
1430.52,1432.52," You know, veteran mode, even veteran mode."
1432.52,1434.52," Yeah, hard mode."
1435.52,1441.52," Or they should also have a board that just lets you because you know, and you look on YouTube, and you see like the greatest shots ever."
1441.52,1442.52," You know, I could God."
1442.52,1445.52," Because you know how like it, keep the pitch keeps increasing."
1445.52,1446.52, Yeah.
1446.52,1449.52," As you're, as you're getting combos and stuff in the meter fills up on the side and you're like,"
1449.52,1451.52," God, I didn't even know it could go that high."
1451.52,1452.52, Yeah.
1452.52,1453.52," You know, it changes color and stuff."
1453.52,1458.52, We'll create like a board that basically just facilitates that so everyone can get a taste of that glory.
1458.52,1463.52," Just like a board that's no matter what you do, you're going to get some crazy combo."
1463.52,1470.52," But where it's possible just to have just it's kind of, I'm kind of asking for the peggle equivalent of killer instinct."
1470.52,1475.52, So fighting game that was made just for that glory of people like.
1475.52,1478.52," They're like dude, people play Street Fighter."
1478.52,1479.52, They get excited.
1479.52,1480.52, They do a five-hit combo.
1480.52,1483.52, They play ball-rug and they got a nine hit combo in the arsenal.
1483.52,1484.52, Why do we got a hundred?
1484.52,1486.52, I wasn't even going.
1486.52,1492.52," When I was playing with a sweet guy, I wondered if they made the, if they made the graphic look the way it did like to cause maximum."
1492.52,1495.52," And then, I was going to cause maximum embarrassment for people who play the game."
1495.52,1498.52, Because it's so embarrassing because it's so Katie.
1498.52,1503.52," It's so, you know, the talking animals and the kind of, you know, tell it to be sort of lucky."
1503.52,1510.52," For some reason, no on PC, I don't think, for who's going to, I think it would only be maybe if like your drinking buds came over."
1510.52,1512.52, But no women in the house.
1512.52,1516.52," I mean, I've been to places where, you know, like the computer and a hotel lobby."
1516.52,1519.52, And there's like some mom down there playing elf bowling.
1519.52,1521.52," And you're like, wait and get on the computer and check your email."
1521.52,1523.52," She's like, can I just do two more frames?"
1523.52,1530.52," You know, it's like, I don't think, I think, like, women and stuff are used to like, yeah, your computer, you can play some pinball if you want, you know."
1530.52,1531.52, Yeah.
1531.52,1534.52," What's sort of what your dreams in for Peggle, what theme would you have preferred?"
1534.52,1536.52," Well, they did have the do a peggle extreme, right?"
1536.52,1540.52," So you can, you can get the, the half life skins on there, right?"
1540.52,1542.52," You can get that off a valve off a steam, sorry."
1542.52,1544.52, That doesn't make it any cooler though.
1544.52,1547.52," That's actually, that was going to be a little bit of a waste of it."
1547.52,1550.52," No, guys, I'm playing half life."
1550.52,1555.52," So you're saying, if you're going to play, you might just have it a good."
1555.52,1557.52, You should just go all out.
1557.52,1560.52, You might as well have thought the way would it go.
1560.52,1562.52, Just tell them to design it.
1562.52,1563.52, Probably not worried about it.
1563.52,1566.52," Probably like basically you're playing your, your masculine."
1566.52,1567.52, You're not playing Peggle on your iPods.
1567.52,1568.52, That means you're playing in your house.
1568.52,1572.52," I mean, who, who in your house are you worried about seeing you playing Peggle on being like?"
1572.52,1573.52, Why?
1573.52,1574.52, Why?
1574.52,1575.52, I don't know.
1575.52,1576.52, Why do you worried about it in public either?
1576.52,1577.52, I don't know.
1577.52,1578.52, I don't know.
1578.52,1579.52, I have image problems.
1580.52,1582.52, You got to own up to the nerds.
1582.52,1583.52, Okay.
1583.52,1584.52," Well, I'll work on that."
1584.52,1585.52," Thanks, guys."
1585.52,1586.52, Thanks for the pep talk.
1586.52,1589.52," So when you have your income to your house, so wait."
1589.52,1591.52," So, Ryan mentioned puzzle quest."
1591.52,1594.52, I want to know what was on as Sean Maloisless.
1594.52,1596.52, That did not make the GFW top 10.
1596.52,1597.52, Top 10.
1597.52,1601.52, I still play and have been playing for a while.
1601.52,1604.52," Dark avatar, the Gelsive 2 expansion."
1604.52,1605.52, Right.
1605.52,1607.52, That is my like go to almost casual game.
1607.52,1608.52, It's kind of weird.
1608.52,1610.52, Like it's on my laptop and I'll play it on the boss and stuff.
1610.52,1612.52, And which is even kind of geekier.
1612.52,1613.52, Like that is hardcore.
1613.52,1616.52," Someone next to me go, I don't know what that is."
1616.52,1618.52, Some sort of solar system.
1618.52,1620.52, It is a damn fine game.
1620.52,1623.52, You are kind of the closet turn based strategy.
1623.52,1626.52," Yeah, I've heard the same from people I know."
1626.52,1629.52, None of you have ever completed play yet.
1629.52,1630.52," But, not."
1630.52,1633.52," I mean, if you're not into turn based strategy, you're not going to dig this one."
1633.52,1636.52, But it like for a lot of people who are into it.
1636.52,1638.52," Like, so far is kind of their go to a game."
1638.52,1639.52, Yeah.
1639.52,1643.52, So the only thing that's kept me from getting into those games is to say lack multiplayer.
1643.52,1644.52, I don't want multiplayer.
1644.52,1646.52," I never play, so far multiplayer either."
1646.52,1649.52, I know that's like a big flaw with it.
1649.52,1651.52," Like for some people, but yeah."
1651.52,1652.52, It doesn't bother me at all.
1652.52,1655.52," Because like I said, I'm playing in my laptop on the bus."
1655.52,1658.52," But you know, you get a few turns in."
1658.52,1664.52," And if you're like playing a really big galaxy, you can only get like four major turns in"
1664.52,1666.52," the first home, but it's a good way to pass the time."
1666.52,1670.52," Yeah, the only reason I haven't gotten into the galsive because I do like turn based strategy"
1670.52,1673.52, games a lot is just the space theme.
1673.52,1674.52, I'm not an outer space guy.
1674.52,1675.52, Or just not.
1675.52,1676.52," No else, not for jazz."
1676.52,1679.52," I need the else in the Nomes or it's dark,"
1679.52,1681.52," based like Civ, which I love."
1681.52,1685.52, Were you into Star Control 2 or you know what I did?
1685.52,1686.52, I love Star Control 2.
1686.52,1687.52, That's true.
1687.52,1688.52, I don't know why.
1688.52,1690.52, The Star Control games were a little different.
1690.52,1693.52," Yeah, that's not the same thing, but Star Control 2 is kind of a class."
1693.52,1694.52, Right.
1694.52,1700.52," But like of all the general games, the one that that really I loved to death was fantasy"
1700.52,1703.52, general over a Panzer general or the other one.
1703.52,1705.52," Yeah, I guess you can."
1705.52,1706.52, You can.
1706.52,1707.52, You can.
1707.52,1710.52," I know there's some great turn based strategy games that are like,"
1710.52,1714.52, World War II based and I won't even consider picking one of those.
1714.52,1715.52, Right.
1715.52,1718.52," Like to me, space or dragons for some reason, even if the game mechanics are identical,"
1718.52,1721.52," or even if I know they're inferior to some other game that I hear is awesome,"
1721.52,1724.52, but it happens to be set.
1724.52,1727.52," Yeah, I just look at, you know, I look at the alien races in a game like Galsive,"
1727.52,1732.52," which I believe is probably a great game, but I can't, I can't get my head around it."
1732.52,1734.52, What did the alien do?
1734.52,1736.52," But if it's an arc, I get it."
1736.52,1739.52," Now, I'm not a Star Wars dude."
1739.52,1742.52," I want to think with the vibe of 2001, the space Odyssey."
1742.52,1747.52," Let's say I like, like, I like good sci-fi and space as a theme is like,"
1747.52,1751.52," infinitely fascinating to me, but I think it's like some of them when I look at the box,"
1751.52,1756.52," and I get the sense that the ships and stuff are just, they just look crappy to me."
1756.52,1758.52, It looks like little kids toys or something.
1758.52,1762.52," But Galsive has this thing one of its creatures like,"
1762.52,1763.52, you're creating your own shit.
1763.52,1765.52, But they just inevitably are going to be tinkered.
1765.52,1768.52," Yeah, they just completely look at whatever you want."
1768.52,1769.52, Look at that.
1769.52,1772.52," But yeah, I mean, maybe if they get it right,"
1772.52,1775.52," and I see like some vision of the future that involves, you know,"
1775.52,1779.52," space exploration and stuff, then I could be all for it."
1779.52,1782.52, I would play a really good battle story galactic game though.
1782.52,1783.52, That I'm down with.
1783.52,1785.52, I want a good or firefly.
1785.52,1790.52," Does that affect, like one of my favorite sort of like pop sci-fi things"
1790.52,1793.52," was book called 2001 Night, as a graphic novel."
1793.52,1796.52, There are three collections of them.
1796.52,1799.52," But it always had things along the lines of, you know,"
1799.52,1803.52," say humanity finally, you know,"
1804.52,1807.52," lands on some other planet and they find life, you know,"
1807.52,1817.52," and then it turns out that there's this one creature that mimics the appearance and behavior of the top creature in the food chain, right?"
1817.52,1821.52," And so at the time it's just some, you know, weird predatory animal."
1821.52,1826.52, And once people have been on the planet for like three months and they started killing each other along with everything.
1826.52,1832.52, And all of a sudden the animal turns into them or like then there's like a plant that gets people high
1832.52,1834.52, with the equivalent of like oxygen poisoning or something.
1834.52,1836.52," Not people but any kind of animal and then,"
1836.52,1838.52," and then when they're duped up it,"
1838.52,1840.52, it's like a carnivorous plant needs some more.
1840.52,1844.52," But ecosystems based on, you know, like there's fiber optic plants."
1844.52,1846.52," They're plants that are underground,"
1846.52,1849.52, but the other part of them's like they're reverse instead of roots that are down in the ground.
1849.52,1851.52," The roots go up and bring in the light and then they,"
1851.52,1853.52," so things like that, like, wow,"
1853.52,1856.52," so it's not only imaginative, but they're at least like,"
1856.52,1858.52," it's kind of like, you know,"
1859.52,1861.52, extraterrestrial biology.
1861.52,1862.52," It's like an actual field,"
1862.52,1865.52," although of course no one's ever found any piotoph,"
1865.52,1867.52," outside of, you know, earth."
1867.52,1872.52," But I mean, it's based in evolutionary principles and possibilities."
1872.52,1874.52, And I always find that kind of thing really fascinating.
1874.52,1876.52," So to bring it around, I guess I'm asking,"
1876.52,1878.52, does that matter if I have that anything that they're eating?
1878.52,1881.52," That most interesting one was the,"
1881.52,1883.52," I thought it was the programs,"
1883.52,1885.52, but even they're not done at any level like you're talking about.
1885.52,1887.52," It's just a lot of,"
1887.52,1889.52," because I mean, they're all very star trekky."
1889.52,1891.52," They're like, humanoid, which has a lizard face."
1891.52,1893.52," Yeah, people with shit glued on their face."
1893.52,1895.52," I mean, there's a couple of different ones,"
1895.52,1900.52, like there's one that's kind of like these floating jellyfish things that all they do is about religious beliefs.
1900.52,1902.52," And that's kind of cool,"
1902.52,1904.52, but they don't really get into it too much.
1904.52,1906.52," And like, if you're really into it,"
1906.52,1908.52," I guess the place to go to dig into is the Codex,"
1908.52,1911.52," which is anytime you look at something,"
1911.52,1913.52, you'll get a little entry pop-ups.
1913.52,1914.52, Right.
1914.52,1915.52, But that's the Codex has been added.
1915.52,1917.52, But it's not integrated in the world.
1917.52,1920.52," You have to go look and then read some really disconnected,"
1920.52,1922.52," like, just history of a species,"
1922.52,1924.52, because you happen to look at a wall.
1924.52,1927.52," So that, and it seems like there's some stuff to dig in there,"
1927.52,1930.52, but I just haven't because the way it's presented is just so dull.
1930.52,1931.52, Yeah.
1931.52,1933.52," So like, I want to experience this in the world."
1933.52,1934.52," But yeah,"
1934.52,1936.52," like I was hoping for like,"
1936.52,1938.52," you know, the equivalent of stuff and like a veriner of binge novel,"
1938.52,1939.52," or like,"
1939.52,1943.52, just like a pack of dogs that are all actually one being in the further away.
1943.52,1946.52," They get from each other, like the, the downward they get."
1946.52,1948.52," And there's nothing like that at all, you know,"
1948.52,1949.52, that kind of stuff is cool.
1949.52,1950.52, They're two.
1950.52,1951.52," Two doesn't want nights also has this,"
1951.52,1952.52," where people land on this planet,"
1952.52,1953.52," and they're like,"
1953.52,1954.52," they noticed it in the fossil record,"
1954.52,1956.52," all the animals disappear,"
1956.52,1958.52," like every like 25,000 years."
1958.52,1960.52," And then they just are gone from the record,"
1960.52,1962.52, and then suddenly they re-emerge in the record
1962.52,1964.52, after like a certain amount of time.
1964.52,1966.52," And so then what they do is they put it together,"
1966.52,1968.52," so that it's a binary star system,"
1968.52,1970.52, and then what happens is that there's a solar lens.
1970.52,1972.52," In fact, every 25,000 years,"
1972.52,1973.52," and that's when you know,"
1973.52,1976.52," one sun is lined up with the other,"
1976.52,1979.52," and it creates the sort of, you know, gravitational lens,"
1979.52,1981.52, that just blast the planet to shreds.
1981.52,1982.52," So they have this,"
1982.52,1985.52," and this is where it's fantasy is that the creatures,"
1985.52,1987.52, certain creatures on the planet have this sort of like a building
1987.52,1989.52," of migrate through time,"
1989.52,1992.52, and so they migrate around those events.
1992.52,1993.52," I mean,"
1993.52,1994.52," it's so it's like, it's total fantasy,"
1994.52,1996.52," and that does go well beyond the evolution,"
1996.52,1997.52," you know,"
1997.52,1998.52, as soon as you get into any kind of time travel.
1998.52,2000.52," But it's like, I would say,"
2000.52,2003.52," I like it's, you think about it for a second after you hear it."
2003.52,2004.52," You're like, okay, that's cool."
2004.52,2005.52," Let me, let me,"
2005.52,2008.52," Mass Effect has like slightly cooler than normal,"
2008.52,2010.52, and you're like star trekky kind of universe has been up
2010.52,2013.52, and like in some of the best sci-fi you read.
2013.52,2014.52, That's for sure.
2014.52,2015.52," Like, yeah."
2015.52,2017.52, All the ones that I thought would be cool
2017.52,2019.52, ended up kind of being dumb.
2019.52,2020.52," Like, because they have these,"
2020.52,2022.52," these keepers of their column,"
2022.52,2024.52," they're like these little insectoid things,"
2024.52,2025.52," and they sit at all,"
2025.52,2026.52," I don't know how much you've played of it,"
2026.52,2027.52," the Citadel is like,"
2027.52,2028.52, you got to lo me your copy.
2028.52,2030.52," Yeah, I'm dumb with it."
2030.52,2033.52, It's like this big city space station
2033.52,2035.52, that all of the races of the universe
2035.52,2037.52, have kind of flocked to.
2037.52,2040.52," But there's these bug things that are going maintenance,"
2040.52,2042.52," and no one knows like where they came from,"
2042.52,2044.52, and you're not supposed to interfere with them.
2044.52,2046.52, So there's kind of like the story that could be there.
2046.52,2048.52," And then when a kind of emerges, you're like,"
2048.52,2049.52," yeah,"
2049.52,2051.52," no, that could have been cooler."
2051.52,2053.52, That's the vibe for that whole game.
2053.52,2055.52," Oh, that could have been cooler."
2055.52,2057.52, What about what about you Jeff?
2057.52,2058.52, Came in the year.
2058.52,2060.52," Ah, that's not on our list."
2060.52,2063.52," I think, let's see, there's a couple."
2063.52,2066.52," One that stands out in my mind now is,"
2066.52,2069.52," the never-winner nights to expansion,"
2069.52,2070.52, mask of the betrayer.
2070.52,2071.52," I think I was,"
2071.52,2073.52," the only one who voted for that,"
2073.52,2075.52," because I was the only one who played it, I think."
2075.52,2076.52, Am I?
2076.52,2077.52, Do we want to play?
2077.52,2080.52," Yeah, it did, it put it on my list of things I should play though."
2080.52,2082.52, Your enthusiasm for it.
2082.52,2083.52, It was really good to me.
2083.52,2088.52," To me, it was just an epic turnaround for the developer"
2088.52,2093.52," who are great pals of mine, whose name I'm completely upset."
2093.52,2095.52," Yeah, you know what I mean."
2095.52,2099.52," I keep saying I was going, I'll believe in oblivion."
2099.52,2101.52, Now that's a game.
2101.52,2102.52," Okay, Obsidian."
2102.52,2104.52, Right.
2104.52,2106.52, Thank you for the save.
2106.52,2111.52," Obsidian, who are the former Black Isle Studios guys, of course."
2111.52,2116.52," Who were behind, speaking of a, of by were there,"
2116.52,2119.52," they were involved with the Baldur's Gate games,"
2119.52,2122.52," but their own games, specifically that were there,"
2122.52,2124.52," where the Ice Windale games,"
2124.52,2126.52," planescape torment,"
2126.52,2128.52, what else am I forgetting?
2128.52,2131.52," So the Obsidian split from Black Isle Studios, right?"
2131.52,2134.52," Black Isle Studios closed down, interplay basically."
2134.52,2136.52, This frised from the ashes.
2136.52,2140.52," Yeah, and all the principles from Black Isle formed Obsidian."
2140.52,2143.52," Well, who's making world shift?"
2143.52,2144.52," Oh, I don't know."
2144.52,2146.52, I have to check for some reason.
2146.52,2149.52, I was thinking it was a big question mark of former.
2149.52,2150.52, Yeah.
2150.52,2152.52, These were the main by those groups all the time.
2152.52,2157.52," Furgas, Erka Harden, and the other principles from Black Isle."
2157.52,2160.52," Cedian and their first game was Cotor II,"
2160.52,2164.52," and then their next game was Neverwinter Nights II,"
2164.52,2168.52, which of course didn't get as wide as didn't get very well received.
2168.52,2178.52," But this expansion, to me, it really fulfilled the promise of the story telling that we saw from these guys back in the, in the, in the planescape torment days."
2178.52,2186.52," To me, it was a complete, just getting back to what these guys really do best,"
2186.52,2190.52," which is telling a story in this kind of,"
2190.52,2196.52," telling a story within the context of a pretty hardcore RPG,"
2197.52,2201.52, with a great amount of intelligence and humor along the way.
2201.52,2211.52," You know, this genre is way easy enough for us to lapse into one of our stupid voices when, if you read the dialogue, because it's all D&D stuff."
2211.52,2220.52," But these guys have a good sense of, of doing that and taking it seriously enough so that they're not, they're not condescending, they're not pandering."
2220.52,2225.52," But yet they're also throwing enough to sort of acknowledge like, okay, let's not take this too seriously."
2226.52,2243.52," So I respect that a lot. And just the gameplay too, I felt like the puzzles throughout the levels were just sort of like we were talking about half life, just challenging enough to, to tax your brain, but not make you feel cheated or whatever."
2243.52,2251.52," So I just had a really great time with that game and, and it was, it was a surprise to me, actually, how good it was."
2252.52,2254.52, That was my recommendation.
2254.52,2255.52, Sounds good.
2255.52,2257.52, I will play it someday.
2257.52,2259.52, I got a nine million games program.
2259.52,2260.52," Yeah, I lost the Sean Elliott."
2260.52,2269.52," Most of my stuff got on the list, they're stalker, which didn't, and I, I've talked about that last week about some of the things that make that a good game."
2269.52,2275.52," And they kind of think that it will be overlooked just because it, you know, came out early in the year."
2275.52,2277.52, That's always an issue.
2277.52,2279.52, I like the Academy Awards.
2279.52,2281.52," Yeah, come at early in the year."
2281.52,2287.52, And then I think it did have technical troubles that prevented many people from playing it when it first came out and then happening to you.
2287.52,2295.52," And then also in the list, it would be, I'll do Sterbavic 1946, which was, you know, sort of,"
2295.52,2303.52," secret weapons of World War II hypothetical expansion, but I mean, all vehicles based on designs for things that were actually either"
2303.52,2313.52," test flown or that, you know, were in preparation or that actually did, you know, see use after the war immediately after."
2313.52,2321.52," And just because there's a lot, I mean, there's a lot of, you know, fun, you know, vehicles to fly in there, but the game in general, it was my introduction to this series."
2321.52,2328.52," And it was like so eye opening to get into it. You always think, you know, flight sims, this is not for me."
2328.52,2330.52," Like, that's just for some other person."
2330.52,2337.52," Okay, well, I totally like planes and I like reading about pilots and air combat and it's like, I'm just going to try it."
2337.52,2349.52," And I found out that it was, you know, it was a lot easier to get into the night ever, you know, thought because for one, you're able to adjust so many settings and play the level of sim, the degree of sim that you want."
2349.52,2358.52," And then, you know, getting a flight stick and getting all that other hardware that goes along with it that all, you know, the guys keep got with like the track I or head tracker just made it incredible."
2358.52,2363.52, So that was definitely one of my most memorable experiences of the year to put it on your list.
2363.52,2372.52," Um, I don't know. I knew it had no chance in hell of making our top 10, so you voted because that was a vote, you know, so you voted politically then."
2372.52,2377.52," I guess I did. I don't know. It was kind of, yeah, I guess it would been thrown a vote away, you know, like it wouldn't have done anything."
2377.52,2379.52, It's septem power other votes.
2379.52,2380.52, Uh-huh.
2380.52,2381.52, It's like later.
2381.52,2382.52," Yeah, right."
2382.52,2384.52, It really is your nature.
2384.52,2394.52, But I found a way to get credit for it in there nonetheless. So I got to both vote with my conscience and do a pragmatic vote.
2394.52,2396.52, And you got to mention on the podcast.
2396.52,2400.52," Many times I talked, yeah, and I'm all about to be made by a silly hat about everything."
2400.52,2402.52, That thing is red.
2402.52,2411.52," You know, there was, there's this video that came out and created a stir recently on YouTube and it's someone who who rigged up the Wii remote to act like a head tracker."
2411.52,2415.52," And it was sort of annoying to see all these foreign posts about, oh my god, this is phenomenal."
2415.52,2419.52," This is the usual Nintendo notts. And you know, and I say that is a fusion of Nintendo fan."
2419.52,2427.52," I shouldn't have to explain every time I say this, but it's like, kind of like the added, you know, that great kernel wisdom that not all Nintendo fans are retards,"
2427.52,2429.52, but all retards are indeed Nintendo.
2429.52,2434.52," Where, you know, it's like this is the greatest thing ever."
2434.52,2437.52," I can't believe that this technology, the God, the things you can do with it."
2437.52,2443.52," And it's cool that you could do that with it, but watching the guy basically glue the Wii sensor on to a hat."
2443.52,2447.52, He was just making himself a rudimentary form of the track I are.
2447.52,2451.52," And the thing is that to use this nitty-casty, the games have to be made to support it."
2451.52,2455.52," But with PC, many games exist, the two support it, and that's the good thing."
2455.52,2463.52," And so all of us who have track I are and the play with it, or like, oh, yeah, I see what he's doing there because I've been doing it with my games for quite some time."
2463.52,2465.52, And it's so fun and it is a great feeling.
2465.52,2469.52," Like, I mean, it did add so much to, you know, when you play I'll do and you're flying."
2469.52,2475.52," And you look up in the canopy as you're inverted, you know, because you're trying to keep a beat on, you know, the guy that you're dog fighting."
2475.52,2477.52, It's just so rad.
2477.52,2481.52," I mean, you get the sense just like if you were in a real vehicle, you know, I'm moving with the sticks and, you know,"
2481.52,2483.52," and the rudder pedals and everything else, the vehicle this way."
2483.52,2487.52, And I'm using my head to look around the cockpit and stuff.
2487.52,2489.52, It was cool.
2489.52,2491.52, There's a lot of tension for it.
2491.52,2495.52, It's just if more maybe more developers would include support for it in their games.
2495.52,2497.52, You can get a lot out of it battlefield two.
2497.52,2499.52, There's no excuse for it.
2499.52,2503.52," If not, use it and I hope that a future battlefield games will look into that."
2503.52,2507.52, So for future.
2507.52,2509.52, That's reach for a.
2509.52,2510.52, I didn't.
2510.52,2513.52," There was a silent there, but I think we were all."
2513.52,2515.52, We're all going true.
2515.52,2518.52," So like no one was listening to you, Sean."
2518.52,2520.52, Let's talk about games coming out this year.
2520.52,2524.52," I mean, we know that there's a lot of stuff coming out."
2524.52,2526.52, That we're all excited about.
2526.52,2528.52, Follow three is one of them.
2528.52,2529.52, I'll just throw some out here.
2529.52,2531.52, We could decide what we want to talk about one order.
2531.52,2534.52," I'm excited for brothers, norms, hells, highways,"
2534.52,2535.52, been in development forever.
2535.52,2537.52, It's coming border lands.
2537.52,2540.52, You're supposed to come this year from the same studio gear box.
2540.52,2546.52," And that one that's also being published by 2K, like fallout."
2546.52,2547.52, Uh-huh.
2547.52,2548.52, Excited for that.
2548.52,2549.52," Spore, of course."
2549.52,2550.52," Oh, yeah."
2550.52,2552.52, It's going to come out at long last this year.
2552.52,2554.52," So they say, it will."
2554.52,2555.52, Media future.
2555.52,2557.52, We've got quite a few releases on the horizon.
2557.52,2558.52, Left or dead.
2558.52,2560.52, Last I was told it was March.
2560.52,2561.52, We'll see.
2561.52,2562.52, It's very much about that year.
2562.52,2566.52," But again, the thing giving me hope is that when I last played it, it was as good as gold."
2566.52,2571.52," I mean, I could imagine them saying, oh, yeah, this is coming out in three weeks from now."
2571.52,2575.52," And how would it experience I had at least from the human side was, dude, this is ready to go."
2575.52,2578.52, Get this in people's hands now.
2578.52,2580.52, Frontlines fuel a war.
2580.52,2582.52, Jerry's out on that.
2582.52,2584.52," The console demo, not so cool."
2584.52,2586.52, We need to play it on PC.
2586.52,2587.52, We can't put it on our camera.
2587.52,2588.52, It must be good.
2588.52,2589.52, There.
2589.52,2590.52, Let's see.
2590.52,2591.52," I mean, it has the pedigree."
2591.52,2592.52, It's like the guys that made the desert combat.
2592.52,2594.52, The odd for battlefield.
2594.52,2598.52, They definitely know what they're doing and they have some interesting ideas for the game.
2598.52,2599.52, So that's coming out soon.
2599.52,2601.52, We'll get to play it.
2602.52,2606.52," I'll see what's it called, the MMO, the Pirate MMO is coming out soon."
2606.52,2610.52, Parts of the brincy along with the sins of a solar empire.
2610.52,2614.52," Oh, yeah, I published by StarDoc from Galciv fame."
2614.52,2616.52, I want to play that one.
2616.52,2617.52, That's a great name.
2617.52,2618.52, It really is.
2618.52,2620.52, It lives in a solar empire.
2620.52,2622.52, I want to play it just because of that name.
2622.52,2623.52," But it's in like, it's cool."
2623.52,2625.52," I don't, but I like the name."
2625.52,2628.52, It sounds kind of like a Polish like death metal album or something.
2628.52,2629.52," Right, totally."
2629.52,2630.52, Which is a good thing.
2630.52,2631.52, I don't know what I said.
2631.52,2632.52," Right, totally."
2632.52,2633.52, I don't know what.
2633.52,2634.52, It's a gold.
2634.52,2635.52, It's a gold.
2635.52,2638.52," Well, you bring up a StarDoc."
2638.52,2642.52, Another game of the third game that comes out in 2008 that it's totally going to get swept under the rug.
2642.52,2645.52, Just like the last one was a political machine.
2645.52,2646.52, Political machine.
2646.52,2647.52, Political machine.
2647.52,2648.52, A plastic little game.
2648.52,2649.52, Awesome game.
2649.52,2650.52, Yeah.
2650.52,2653.52," Where when is a, well, it's must be coming out soon."
2653.52,2654.52, Right.
2654.52,2655.52, I guess so.
2655.52,2657.52, The election is this year or so.
2657.52,2658.52, That's a great.
2658.52,2660.52," Yeah, great political simulation."
2660.52,2662.52, If you if you missed it the last time.
2662.52,2664.52," Let me start talking cheek, you know."
2664.52,2665.52, Right.
2665.52,2668.52, It's kind of done for Lars kind of like the real election.
2668.52,2670.52, But it was.
2670.52,2671.52, The last one was a fun game.
2671.52,2673.52, Which puppet do you vote for?
2673.52,2675.52, Sorry.
2675.52,2679.52," Inflicting my, my Berkeley bias into there."
2679.52,2685.52," Um, so by the way, do you know that I found it just today that I'm the same age as Barak Obama?"
2685.52,2686.52, Isn't that weird?
2686.52,2688.52, So you could see we run for president.
2688.52,2689.52, I could.
2689.52,2690.52, I'd vote for you.
2690.52,2691.52, Thanks Ryan.
2691.52,2694.52, Because being the same authority.
2694.52,2695.52, Sorry for you.
2695.52,2696.52, We don't want to call the politics.
2696.52,2698.52," So God, I'll get started on the shit."
2698.52,2699.52, I'm not on Ron Paul today.
2699.52,2702.52," No, no, we'll stay out of the preliminary."
2702.52,2703.52," Yeah, you got to know."
2703.52,2706.52," Well, because of course he's everyone that was saying he's a crack pot."
2706.52,2710.52," Well, there's like more than inclusive evidence that he is indeed a crack pot out of the"
2710.52,2711.52, extreme variety.
2711.52,2714.52, This is like a Elvis is on Mars kind of level stuff.
2714.52,2719.52," No, I mean, starts with like calling like Martin Luther King, uh, what did it come?"
2719.52,2722.52," A homosexual pedophile and like, but a lot of other stuff."
2722.52,2726.52," I mean, him writing about like, you know, race war and warning everyone that they need to."
2726.52,2729.52, They need to get out of urban areas and if that was Charles.
2729.52,2731.52," I mean, that was Charles Manson's, uh, big thing."
2731.52,2734.52," And if they have, so he shares the helter sculptor platform."
2734.52,2735.52, They have the helter.
2735.52,2736.52, That melody.
2736.52,2743.52," Yeah, then they need to get some, uh, some rural property and stock it up with guns and the usual."
2743.52,2744.52, Uh-huh.
2744.52,2745.52, Just yeah.
2745.52,2746.52," You know, he's got Manson's vote."
2746.52,2747.52, Manson's insane.
2747.52,2748.52, Why don't go in?
2748.52,2749.52, I told everybody.
2749.52,2750.52, Rampals.
2750.52,2751.52, Rampals.
2751.52,2752.52, Got to write.
2752.52,2753.52, Do you wait?
2753.52,2754.52, I got a question.
2754.52,2756.52, So what game do we look forward to?
2756.52,2757.52, Oh yeah.
2757.52,2758.52, Let's continue on it.
2758.52,2762.52," Far Cry 2 is also supposed to come out this, uh, this, this, this falls."
2762.52,2763.52, Right.
2763.52,2764.52, Right.
2764.52,2765.52, I think so.
2765.52,2766.52," Uh, theoretically."
2766.52,2767.52, Rath of the Litch King.
2767.52,2768.52, Rath of the Litch King.
2768.52,2769.52," Oh, yeah."
2769.52,2770.52, That's kind of a given it for me.
2770.52,2772.52," Uh, the new, uh, the new game from Monolith is that coming out of a way to roll."
2772.52,2773.52, Project Project or Project.
2773.52,2774.52," Project or Project, or Project North?"
2774.52,2775.52, Definitely.
2775.52,2776.52, Huxley.
2776.52,2777.52, Maybe they'll come out.
2777.52,2783.52," Maybe it won't, um, the Conan, uh, MMO, Adrian Cohen is in March."
2783.52,2784.52, Age of Conan.
2784.52,2785.52, Cornan.
2785.52,2786.52, I'm boring.
2786.52,2789.52, I think we're going to get a turoc is coming to PC.
2789.52,2790.52, Thank god.
2790.52,2793.52," Assassin's Creed was supposed to, who knows if ever will now."
2793.52,2795.32, I haven't heard so much about it.
2795.32,2796.32, It's been such a divisive game.
2796.32,2797.32," I mean, I know."
2797.32,2800.82," I want to play it just because of the thing where I, and I guess nothing's stopping"
2800.82,2804.88, getting here for 360 but it's like knowing it's going to be better if we wait.
2804.88,2806.48, How are they going to purchase what's in?
2806.48,2808.38, That's something I would play in console anyway.
2808.38,2810.42, I think just because it kind of feels like one.
2810.42,2812.1000000000004, It looks like it feels like one for me.
2812.1000000000004,2815.5, I think we had this discussion before what feels like a console game versus what doesn't.
2815.5,2816.5, Right.
2816.5,2819.6600000000003, I'm going to have to assume Mass Effect will be ported to PC.
2819.6600000000003,2820.86, I think so.
2820.86,2822.86, One old Dragon Age Dragon Age.
2822.86,2824.42, That's theoretically coming out this year.
2824.42,2827.42, We haven't either believed that we're going to start hearing about that soon.
2827.42,2828.42, It would be very nice.
2828.5,2830.06, Alan Wake may be will come out.
2830.06,2831.26, I'm really excited about that.
2831.26,2834.98, They just said the GDC that Alan Wake is coming this year.
2834.98,2835.98, Excellent.
2835.98,2837.1800000000003, They're not GDC but.
2837.1800000000003,2838.1800000000003, See.
2838.1800000000003,2839.1800000000003, My acronyms.
2839.1800000000003,2840.1800000000003, Yeah.
2840.1800000000003,2841.98, They've shown very little of that game.
2841.98,2845.82, We did the cover story of it and got some information.
2845.82,2849.14, Everything I've heard about it sounds excellent.
2849.14,2854.7000000000003, It sounds like entirely novel approach to making a game.
2854.7000000000003,2857.34, It sounds like kind of game that I don't.
2857.42,2859.1400000000003, I don't want to know more about it.
2859.1400000000003,2861.78, Like I kind of already am sold that I will play it.
2861.78,2863.38, So I just like to.
2863.38,2864.94," I would like if it came out all of a sudden,"
2864.94,2866.82," I was like, oh, Alan Wake, where'd that come from?"
2866.82,2867.82, Right.
2867.82,2872.06, It doesn't look like a very like Gabriel night sort of.
2872.06,2873.3, Idea.
2873.3,2876.58, Just the whole of the character and like the whole sort of horror.
2876.58,2877.1800000000003, Yeah.
2877.1800000000003,2878.1800000000003, Yeah.
2878.1800000000003,2879.02, It's long-sleep.
2879.02,2881.1000000000004," It's a horror game and it doesn't have the,"
2881.1000000000004,2885.1400000000003," it doesn't resort to the usual collection of like bump mapped,"
2885.14,2888.22, slimy critters that you end up getting something over the head
2888.22,2890.18, with this lead pipe for the entirety of the game.
2890.18,2892.8599999999997, So first I don't get any indication that it has that.
2892.8599999999997,2894.42, I know I haven't seen anything like that.
2894.42,2898.7," We've seen atmosphere, effects, and tornadoes and stuff like this."
2898.7,2902.18, And you've seen this very twin peaks like environment.
2902.18,2905.06, The guy going through the Northwestern woods in the logging.
2905.06,2905.3799999999997, Yeah.
2905.3799999999997,2907.46," Like that alone is like, that's great."
2907.46,2909.2599999999998, They would literally play about it.
2909.2599999999998,2910.1, Yeah.
2910.1,2911.1, Yeah.
2911.1,2913.58, I want to play like a game set in the town between peaks and that line area.
2913.58,2916.86," It's just like when Starker came out, it was so great that like,"
2916.86,2920.22, here's some place on the map that I haven't meant to in a game.
2920.22,2923.5," You know, like, Pripyat was was copied by, you know,"
2923.5,2927.2999999999997," called it before is a setting to excellent, you know, results."
2927.2999999999997,2931.02," And I mean, it was just great running around like,"
2931.34,2933.86," uh, the outskirts of Chernobyl."
2933.86,2935.58, There's just a fantastic place to put a game.
2935.58,2937.66," And I'm kind of convinced in the, in the,"
2937.66,2940.62, the promise of doing something in the Northwest as well.
2940.62,2941.66," I mean, I'm from that area."
2941.66,2945.74," And it's just, it's cool when you get out into some of the messed up towns."
2945.74,2949.18, And the twin peaks prove just how creepy that region can be.
2949.66,2950.14, Yeah.
2950.14,2953.02, It's got some good stuff in it backwards.
2953.66,2954.22," Um,"
2955.02,2955.8199999999997, I'm into that.
2955.8199999999997,2959.1," Like, the games is a place to go, you know, when they take you to some place that you're,"
2959.5,2962.7799999999997," you're not used to being, yeah, even though I just said it's some place I like."
2962.7799999999997,2965.8999999999996," Like my, but it's a good version of that."
2966.14,2968.8599999999997, What I mean is like place that I'm not used to going in video games.
2969.1,2970.54, Like my own galaxies.
2970.8599999999997,2971.2599999999998, Right.
2971.34,2971.98, All those.
2971.98,2972.78, I like going to those.
2972.78,2973.7400000000002, Like Azara.
2973.7400000000002,2974.6200000000003, Because they're happy.
2974.6200000000003,2976.2200000000003," But like, they're a lot like this."
2976.2200000000003,2978.78," And this is opposed to like a generic,"
2978.78,2982.6200000000003," committee, Eastern town that I feel like I've been to in a billion games or some"
2982.94,2988.0600000000004," the region or New York city, you know, or LA or something and all the billion"
2988.0600000000004,2988.78, games from that.
2988.78,2990.3, And that's just all turned up to me too.
2990.3,2990.6200000000003, Yeah.
2992.3,2993.6600000000003," Yeah, we need some like,"
2994.0600000000004,2998.38, Russo finish fighting on on Jet powered skis and stuff.
2998.46,3001.5," They should another, we'll always bring it up Russian contraptions."
3001.5,3007.58," They had like, it was a box on skis with like a kind of when you think of a swamp buggy in Louisiana,"
3007.58,3010.78," you know, where they've got like the big fan on the back of their hair."
3010.78,3012.1400000000003," Yeah, like that it was skis."
3013.02,3014.2200000000003, It's guns in the side.
3015.42,3016.54, Sounds plausible to me.
3016.54,3017.98, They had one of those in gentle band.
3019.42,3020.3, Jet powered jet.
3020.3,3021.42," Oh, the buggy."
3021.42,3021.9, Yeah.
3021.9,3022.1400000000003, Yeah.
3022.78,3023.98, Or did they had the snow thing?
3023.98,3025.1800000000003," No, it was like a swamp buggy."
3025.1800000000003,3025.5, Yeah.
3025.5,3026.1400000000003, In gentle band.
3026.1400000000003,3026.38," Oh, yeah."
3026.38,3027.7400000000002," Well, the railroad on the back."
3027.8199999999997,3030.2999999999997, That was in that was always in the proper two.
3030.2999999999997,3030.8599999999997, Wasn't it?
3030.8599999999997,3031.58, Flipper today.
3031.58,3032.14, One of those.
3032.14,3032.8599999999997," Yeah, double blade."
3032.8599999999997,3033.58, Kids own one.
3033.58,3034.3799999999997," Oh, really?"
3034.3799999999997,3034.8599999999997, Yeah.
3034.8599999999997,3037.8999999999996, I want to flip a rip off general band and what's with the other way around.
3037.8999999999996,3039.8999999999996," I think they, they all ripped off last year."
3039.8999999999996,3040.8599999999997," You've got to do some, yeah."
3040.8599999999997,3041.66, They all keep it up.
3041.66,3042.14," Oh, you know."
3042.14,3042.62, You see hype.
3043.5,3043.9799999999996, Right.
3045.02,3048.14," Some people, you're listening to the probably don't know what these things are."
3048.14,3050.2999999999997," But yeah, they're basically if you're that young,"
3050.2999999999997,3054.22," uh, flipper is it dolphin and he was like the family buddy and pet."
3054.22,3054.4599999999996, All right.
3054.4599999999996,3055.5, You kind of talked to.
3055.74,3057.74," I mean, he did a smart."
3057.74,3058.94, He was the first one.
3058.94,3062.94," This was proving like, you know, like with with last year's like the these."
3062.94,3064.78, These animals are smarter than you think.
3064.78,3065.34, And they're there.
3065.34,3065.74, Right.
3065.74,3066.38, They're loyal.
3066.38,3066.94, And they're.
3066.94,3067.5, Uh-huh.
3067.5,3068.94," Last year did everything, man."
3069.34,3070.3, Last year was a good dog.
3070.3,3070.94, Yeah.
3070.94,3072.78, The dolphin and sequestexually could.
3072.78,3073.82, Last year did everything.
3073.82,3074.86, It said really it on the rug.
3075.5,3077.02, It was last year would never do that.
3077.02,3077.74, I don't know.
3079.1,3081.74," So for these games, I mean, I don't know."
3081.74,3084.38," Like, I mean, I'm excited about some more than others."
3084.38,3087.82," I mean, on that list, I think fall out three and borderlands have enormous"
3087.82,3088.94, potential inside of those.
3088.94,3091.1800000000003, And sport just finally needs to come out.
3091.7400000000002,3094.78," Then I'm wondering, I mean, I think this year's going to be,"
3095.9,3096.62, I don't know.
3096.62,3099.42," I mean, I don't want to say every, this is the year that everything changes."
3099.42,3100.94, It's going to be a gradual change.
3100.94,3103.5, But I think we're going to see some significant changes.
3103.5,3106.86," We already know of one game that's, you know,"
3106.86,3109.82," this is not to just pivot our next issue, but because it's relevant."
3109.82,3113.34," I mean, I think it's a big indicator of the way that things are going to change."
3114.2200000000003,3119.98," It's that let's just say a major name in gaming, a PC gaming that we familiar to everyone is"
3119.98,3123.5, basically going to be free and take on an entirely different business model.
3123.5,3124.6200000000003, It's a paradigm shift.
3125.42,3129.34," And hearing about this, it seems like this makes a lot of sense."
3129.34,3134.54," And there's so much potential for this game to bring in, you know, a new audience."
3134.54,3136.54," I mean, for more reasons than the fact that it's free."
3136.54,3141.26," I mean, like even if crisis was free, for example, it's not going to have that many people playing"
3141.34,3143.34," it because again, you have to have the hard-worn stuff."
3143.34,3148.1400000000003," But always, when I think about sport, I'm like, imagine if they did, I wonder how it would work."
3148.1400000000003,3152.86," You know, I mean, if they did, if what if sport was for free, and you had to just access it from"
3152.86,3157.0200000000004," like, you know, the sport page or something and had advertising on it, and then you did micro"
3157.0200000000004,3159.1800000000003, transactions in the game if you wanted.
3159.1800000000003,3165.34," You're able to extend your toolbox, your evolutionary toolbox, and, you know, create,"
3166.3,3170.0600000000004," add, you know, well, everyone would have like web feet and stuff in that toolkit, but you"
3170.14,3172.62, would be able to add even more interesting things.
3172.62,3177.82," And I don't know, or a way for ability to swap things with people and just create some other,"
3177.82,3182.14," other, it could be free, but everybody's little spoiling will have like a Pepsi logo on it or something."
3182.14,3186.22," Well, not that without without, without, I know you can be sincere, but yeah, you could do things"
3186.22,3189.74," without cluttering, without splitting up your game with ads."
3189.74,3194.14, You can have the ads in things that are attached to the game in the social networks and
3194.14,3198.14, in the way that you access them without actually putting them in the game world themselves.
3198.22,3202.22," But so that's on my mind. I think that, um, well, one interesting thing about a free model is"
3202.22,3208.22," it destroys the whole piracy issue, right? Absolutely. There's, there's that problem that's all keeping."
3208.7799999999997,3214.7," And the other thing of convincing people to try, you know, to get people to say like, I mean,"
3214.7,3219.1," our U of PC gamers, like, well, most people will never know because they're not going to invest"
3219.1,3224.2999999999997," all that money on the, just to find out whether they like it or not, you know, it's like,"
3224.46,3229.1000000000004," hey, maybe you could be a person who thinks crisis is the single best first person shooter that"
3229.1000000000004,3234.78," you've ever played. However, if you don't have a friend who's got the material there already,"
3234.78,3238.7000000000003," it's going to be a pretty big investment to see. But say what if, for example, you know, you're"
3238.7000000000003,3242.3," able to play some game like sport, we'll just say, and this, and I'm not, don't read, this is"
3242.3,3245.98," me, saying sport will be free. It's not. This is another game entirely I'm talking about."
3245.98,3251.42," But, and you're able to just say like, hey, I'm scanning a message board and we're all talking"
3251.5,3255.98," about, I did this and this and this and other people are like, that sounds cool. And then"
3255.98,3259.7400000000002," let's just go do it and everyone's like, hey, go in now and let's meet here and then everyone just"
3259.7400000000002,3264.06," goes in and plays it and then they're like, next thing they know is like, hey, this is really cool."
3264.06,3268.46," And then they end up a PC gamer that way. Well, free. Free is the reason why most people are playing"
3268.46,3273.42," what they're playing, right? We have the most people are playing Yahoo, checkers or, and look at how,"
3273.42,3279.58," yeah, and not only that, but stuff like Roon'scape and Hobo Hotel and Maple Story and all these"
3279.66,3283.98," games that either some of them are subscription based, but they will have a level of access that's"
3283.98,3289.66," there for you whether or not you pay for this other stuff. Yeah. Well, I think those are the models"
3289.66,3295.02," that are going to be relevant in the years going forward now. The Rhinonscape Hobo Hotel,"
3295.9,3300.94, they have those models have caught the eye of the big publishers and they're all starting to wonder
3300.94,3305.74," why the hell are we not catching in on this? Because I think in light of, you know, like we"
3305.74,3312.22," talked about the way that CryFus and UT3 didn't quite sell this last year, that's not everyone's"
3312.22,3316.7799999999997," minds. They know it. You know, you don't, it's in its scary because it's like, but the message is clear."
3316.7799999999997,3323.02, It's like you don't spend however many million dollars making this epic PC-only game that's
3323.9799999999996,3327.8199999999997," or even multiple platforms sometimes. You know, that's going to come out and it's going to spend"
3327.8199999999997,3331.4199999999996, years and years in development and it's going to come out and no one's going to have any guarantee
3331.58,3337.1," that it's going to be able to recover those costs. And so, I mean, that's a real threat, you know,"
3337.1,3340.86," for all the people, you know, like Shane and some of the guys on one of yours that are all, you know,"
3340.86,3347.42," sounding the death-neil for PC gaming. It's like that stuff is going to change. I mean, and it could"
3347.42,3351.5," mean, it very well mean that PC gaming is a lot different than what we're used to looking at"
3351.5,3358.14," is as a place where there are tons of, you know, games from places you wouldn't expect. You know,"
3358.22,3363.2599999999998," a lot of, you know, European thing stuff is wild and woolly is door fortress, which is, you know,"
3363.2599999999998,3370.2999999999997," an ASCII RPG to games that are pretty big budget, but they're like, World of Warcraft and they have,"
3370.2999999999997,3375.02," you know, different scripts, models to things that are like free and allow you to pay for that"
3375.02,3380.7," pay for themselves by exposing you to advertising, whether inside the game or through the way that"
3380.7,3387.74," you access the game and then also just like by encouraging you to make micro transactions, you know,"
3388.2999999999997,3394.46," right. So it's definitely, I think it's going to be an interesting year, but I mean,"
3394.46,3399.18," I don't know, it's like, I don't know, any kind of sadness in my voice there is just because yes,"
3399.18,3403.42," I do, I like crisis a lot and I want to see games like that. I would love to see them"
3404.2999999999997,3408.8599999999997," continue to come to just PC, but then right, as long as they still, as long as these games"
3408.8599999999997,3413.58," like fall out in borderlands are continue to be a multi-platform, that doesn't bother me in the least,"
3414.46,3419.5," because as long as not pure console, right, you can get a call out 3-SC because it's like I like to"
3419.5,3423.9," play in my PC. So it's like, I don't, that's part of the whole system where it's saying too that bugs me."
3423.9,3428.2999999999997," It's like, if it's not, things just like become invisible when they're not console exclusive,"
3428.2999999999997,3434.62," whatever platform, it's just like, the game's good, it's good and you, uh, sit more place."
3434.62,3437.9," And if you're able to play it where you want to, yeah, for me, it's like, that's better."
3437.9,3441.8199999999997," Because I like the interface and I like, I've said, you know, last, you know, last week,"
3441.98,3446.86," before I like sitting in front of a monitor, I like, you know, having Venture Lawn and talking to people."
3446.86,3453.1800000000003, And just I just like to experience of all tabbing out and checking a forum and all tabbing back in and playing the game.
3453.1800000000003,3458.1400000000003," And just the way that it all works. And that's fine for me. I don't need to build beats on over the head and say,"
3458.94,3462.38," too bad, you know, got crisis. Wouldn't that be nice if you could play crisis?"
3462.38,3467.1800000000003," You know, so as long as it can be able to platform, I'm saying, I'm, I'm happy with it."
3467.1800000000003,3471.02," And I think they're well. There's obviously still a big PC market. They're still, you know,"
3471.58,3477.58," not just like, you know, tens of thousands, there's actually millions of people that agree with what you just said,"
3477.58,3485.1," Sean. And, you know, there's plenty of PC only games. And there's plenty of developers who are PC"
3485.1,3490.7," centric, even if they're still developing from multi platforms, like Valve, Valve is explicitly"
3491.98,3498.62," PC first in terms of its platform choice. And there, of course, is the gigantic white elephant of the"
3498.7,3506.06," nine million people playing wow that kind of, you know, actively prove, you know, what clowns like"
3506.06,3509.2599999999998," Shane are saying, you know, who don't really know what they're talking about. Right."
3509.9,3514.62," You could just, yeah, you got that. There's another, there's something to be said for games that are"
3514.62,3522.46," very PC centric, too, like galactic siph, excellent sales, sales that any that most PS3 game"
3522.46,3527.42," makers would be in VSO for a hard, not that everyone is rather than most, but every single one,"
3527.5,3532.2200000000003," and we go back to save his sold, I mean, in its first month, this old over a million copies, right?"
3534.06,3539.98," So like that, it did, yeah, and it was more it's number one selling. Yeah, I'm not that bad. Right. So"
3539.98,3546.2200000000003," now, the Sims is the other classic example. The Sims is this is the best selling franchise of all time"
3546.86,3553.7400000000002," regardless of platform. That's a PC game, you know, I mean, it's stupid to try to shit out. I hate the"
3553.74,3558.7, fact that I even just said that just now. The fact is that they're there. Yeah. But I don't
3558.7,3563.4199999999996," want to like try it out just like, you know, with this kind of like, well, it's there, even though,"
3563.4199999999996,3567.74," like, I'm not really behind it because I, okay, that's what would be the case if I said Sims, but"
3568.2999999999997,3572.7799999999997," like Sean, if he brought gal siph, it's totally legit because people would be like, well, fine,"
3572.7799999999997,3576.3799999999997," you could keep trucking out Sims and gal siph in this other game I'm about to mention if,"
3577.1,3582.7799999999997," if you like that kind of thing, right? But it's like, well, we do, and so this other game is, of course,"
3582.86,3588.2200000000003," you know, I'll too SQL storm a war and I'll too. I'll too phenomenal sales. It's got a huge"
3588.94,3593.5," audience and storm a war, I think is going to like have there's so many people that are going to be"
3593.5,3598.1400000000003," looking for this game and paying attention to it. One's that don't necessarily say, think of"
3598.1400000000003,3602.46," themselves as like, I'm a hardcore game, right? Just go on to websites and talk about all time,"
3602.46,3606.7000000000003," but they know they follow it and they want to play it. And what happens though is if you don't,"

3649.5,3653.98," He's just been super busy all day isn't and now he's got some back problems, but we'll bring"
3653.98,3658.62," them back in. But you know, we go out and play some pinball with friend of his and we're all trying"
3658.62,3663.34, to talk and I'm like sort of getting a sense for who these people are and what to talk about.
3663.34,3667.66," And like, you know, like so don't sit there and talk about games with Robert the whole night"
3667.66,3672.06, when none of them give a shit about it. And that was the case. It's up there like one of the guys

3903.6600000000003,3908.14, we're not a bit hero of the web except well we do. He's kind of a hero. This this week's
3908.22,3914.3799999999997, here of the web is Steve Easterbrook who is the chief executive of McDonald's in the United Kingdom.
3916.46,3921.58, And the reason he's our hero this the story shut up on the neo-gaff today and I picked it up off
3921.58,3927.8199999999997, of there. The headline is McDonald's boss games to blame for childhood obesity.
3929.58,3936.3799999999997, And the story goes on to say the chief executive of McDonald's UK has hit out at video games
3936.38,3941.5, for being a major cause of the childhood obesity crisis. Kai Kai do is quote like well let's do this
3941.5,3947.7400000000002, back and forth like you can do a new story and I can do his quote go for it. Okay. Steve Easterbrook told
3947.7400000000002,3951.9, the times that the food and drinks industry shared responsibility for the issue with individuals
3951.9,3956.54, and government. But he made special mention of the popularity of games and said that they've
3956.54,3960.54, reduced the amount of time young people spend outdoors quote burning off energy.
3966.38,3975.1800000000003, Absolutely when our society is facing there's no denial about that but if you break it down
3976.06,3983.98, I think there's an education piece how can we better communicate to individuals the importance of
3983.98,3993.1, about its diet of pickled muppet hearts and taking care of themselves. There's a lifestyle element
3993.58,4001.2599999999998, there's fewer green spaces and kids are sad home playing computer games on TV
4001.9,4012.46, way in the past. They've been burning off the energy outside. I think you interjected that muppet heart.
4012.46,4016.7, Yeah that was an adore. You had you had you got to figure out how to do that with an English accent.
4016.7,4025.5," He's funny you can. Oh, I'm going to the time. The McDonald's UK is on the brink of its best"
4025.5,4031.2599999999998, year for two decades. The firm is enjoyed 6% like like for like sales growth in the last year more than
4031.2599999999998,4035.98, 88 million visits for me to McDonald's restaurants last month. Okay.
4035.98,4041.18," No, it's 88 million visits to McDonald's had anything to do with childhood obesity. It's so video."
4041.18,4045.8199999999997, So he's got two things like he's the crackhead he was mad because the method there's a
4045.82,4050.06, met dealer down the block. And then he's pissed off because like Blizzard wouldn't put World of
4050.06,4056.7000000000003," Workout prizes in the fucking happy meals. Yeah, now he's striking back. There you go. Yeah, you picked that."
4056.7000000000003,4061.1800000000003," Right. I mean, none of us are going to sit here and argue that video games actually do promote a"
4061.1800000000003,4067.02," healthy act of lifestyle. I mean, he's not he's not particularly wrong about that. It's just you don't"
4067.02,4071.42," want to hear it from the head of fucking McDonald's. Yeah, why don't even bother making that statement."
4071.7400000000002,4077.66, Like the challenge of toe like it's not us. Some do go. I want you Blizzard to make
4078.62,4082.78, sort of like it works in China. Make a World Warcraft Auto Kick you after four hours of
4082.78,4087.42, consecutive play and then he'll agree to make a burger that's under fucking a thousand calories. Right.
4088.86,4093.5," Or just like van fat people from entering. I mean, have you scale when you come in the door? Yeah,"
4093.5,4098.7," sorry, there's a trap door. It's like, oh, we'll we'll walk out. You've had enough quarter panders for one"
4098.78,4103.74," lifetime. Sorry. Yeah. You know what I mean? I mean, I've never walked in two McDonald's and"
4103.74,4108.7," not seeing a fat person. You know, I'm sorry, ladies, have you seen those commercials for"
4108.7,4114.54, Burger King where they don't have the wapper and then like you get these drugs if humanity freaking
4114.54,4119.66," out. Oh, yeah. They're so scary. So out of wapper. Yeah, and it's like the people the people they"
4119.66,4123.42," shoot on it. Yeah, they're like, they're like, oh, we only have big Macs and it's Burger King. So"
4123.42,4128.22, like you get and these are the freakyest people just going to go to the wall.
4129.58,4133.26, And they're just like this is like how you're convincing me that the loppers are good things.
4134.06,4139.82," Exactly, dude. So look for those commercials. You get a better than David's website too."
4139.82,4145.74, Would you watch like more of them? More than the one that you see on the TV campaign.
4146.3,4151.1," Because I have not gone to the toilet meat to the website to watch. That's pretty pathetic,"
4151.5,4158.46," never really just yeah, it's bad. I don't think I've eaten in McDonald's in two decades."
4158.46,4163.58," I can't say that. I've eaten fast food, but not not McDonald's. Something changed my lifetime"
4163.58,4167.820000000001," that I'm making fun of it because it's like, you know, about to answer my own question. That's"
4167.820000000001,4173.5," something is called growing up. Well, but I had an actual birthday at McDonald's. I don't think"
4173.5,4177.42," in how sad that shit is, but how recently. Well, at the time, because that when you were at"
4178.38,4184.46," you, you and Shane and all you guys put the old on that. Well, because they had like, no, it was of course"
4184.46,4189.42," it was like, I was like under like seven or six or six. Yeah, when I was younger used to make like special"
4189.82,4195.82," pilgrimagees to the like McDonald's that was six blocks away. It was like, whoa, what's with"
4195.82,4201.18," other parents? Well, yeah, see that's another part of the problem with this dude's hypocritical"
4201.18,4205.9800000000005," statement here. Is it McDonald's specifically targets towards little kids? Yeah, you know, this isn't just"
4206.0599999999995,4212.54," fast food like a burger, kidding or whatever. I mean, they speak after little kids. But unlike"
4212.54,4218.0599999999995, that I don't think that's what we're going to do. No one at which very much only targets adults and
4218.0599999999995,4221.9, it tells kids that they should ask their parents before they attempt to cast a spell.
4225.179999999999,4229.98," No, they both, they're both guilty. They both. I mean, yeah, it's like again, it goes back to the"
4229.98,4234.459999999999," parent, you know, you parents buying the burger, parents buying dragon quest joker, you know,"
4234.46,4240.06," if you don't want your kid trying to cast a spell for fucking six hours a day, you don't want your"
4240.06,4245.1," kid. You can out bring a dragon quest joker outside with you. Morey povitch show. Sure, you can"
4245.1,4251.1," run with it, even if you wanted to. Do you guys still get jobs as Ronald McDonald's? Are there like"
4251.1,4256.54," Ronald McDonald's? Yeah, I got the rest of it. I still do, but we don't want to speculate on like how they've"
4256.54,4263.58," changed. What do you mean, the demographic of guys who are Ronald McDonald's probably looks a little"
4263.58,4268.46," bit different than he did. What do you say? I mean, I was kind of ethnic statement. I am and it's"
4268.46,4273.66, not a racist one. I think it's one to just reflect the nature of what's happened with the economy.
4273.66,4278.54," So Ronald McDonald McDonald, so that's what you mean. That's probably what I mean because"
4279.26,4284.22," now I get up to defend this. So people don't get the wrong idea. Of course, a lot of us remember"
4284.22,4288.86," when I was in high school, you know, plenty of kids that were working McDonald's and you envy them."
4288.94,4293.98," Like damn, dude, do they have any more jobs? Sorry, man. And like, seriously, this is probably"
4293.98,4298.7," very strange to kids nowadays. It depends where you live. Maybe, I don't know, you know, again,"
4298.7,4304.38," like if you're in some super world town, but in the same physical barrier, there's no like"
4305.82,4310.38," white, whatever teenager with parents that are middle-linked, um, that's like, oh, god, I can't like,"
4310.38,4314.0599999999995," there's no opening McDonald's. There's no opening McDonald's. And if there is, like, fuck yeah, that's"
4314.14,4318.06," rad. Good job. You're in a dustrease and you're going to work your way in the world, you know,"
4318.06,4323.34," but for whatever reason, it's like now you don't, well, at least here, too. It's a, you don't see"
4324.06,4330.14," teenagers that look like they come from, you know, middle-class families working at fast food restaurants,"
4330.14,4334.9400000000005," let alone being the clown, let alone being Ronald McDonald. So like again, I'm not saying,"
4334.9400000000005,4339.34," I'm not saying that that, because he was up to that. He worked up to Ronald McDonald, but I'm just saying"
4339.42,4345.02," because like that's just how we get this right. Yeah, yeah. You know, that, that want that work and"
4345.02,4349.02," they're probably, you know, doing the job a lot better than some of the assholes I knew that work."
4349.02,4353.02," Yeah. I wonder if they were crewed differently for the clown position now. You know,"
4353.02,4358.860000000001, can you go from red shirt to fryer? I think it's a different clown. They go out.
4358.860000000001,4362.3, Probably better. I don't think you're circus resident makeup. Do you rather have grease on you?
4362.3,4367.58, Or would you rather be in the smelly ass grimist thing with a little kids kicking you in your job?
4367.58,4371.5," Yeah, having the having the do birthday. Yeah. Happy birthday, Joey."
4372.54,4375.82, Fuck you Ronald. Yeah. What is Ronald's character?
4375.82,4378.78," I'm just like, yeah, what is he? That's what I'm saying."
4378.78,4383.1, Because he used to be he was a character. He was part of McDonald land back in the day. The hamburger
4383.1,4386.94," or he was really fused all of the McDonald-man characters out. No, they got sued."
4386.94,4391.42," And they even had birdie remember that? Was that kind of like the Joe camel shit? Like birdie,"
4391.42,4396.3, the chicken nugget Mitch is like the same as Joe Camel. Is that why they got sued?
4397.26,4402.62, They got sued because of the HR puff and stuff or McDonald the whole McDonald land thing did.
4402.62,4405.900000000001, That's why. Mayor Mitch cheese. Is there too much like yeah go Wikipedia?
4405.900000000001,4411.58," Yes, things. Yes. Right. City Marty Croft. Go Wikipedia like puff and stuff and McDonald."
4411.58,4417.5," So it was a big lawsuit because that whole thing that Mayor Mitch cheese, the hamburger, all those dudes."
4418.06,4421.900000000001," They actually McDonald said actually approached, I'm putting on my history cap in the"
4421.9,4425.98, video. This is interesting. I didn't imagine me kidding you folks. They uh McDonald's actually
4425.98,4431.66," when they dreamed up that whole scheme, they hit up City Marty Croft to be involved in doing that."
4431.66,4436.78," Uh-huh. And City Marty Croft said, and now thanks. But Ronald McDonald himself predates the McDonald"
4436.78,4442.219999999999, pre-dates the McDonald land thing. I'm talking specifically McDonald land. Which when I was a kid did
4442.219999999999,4445.82, seem like kind of a cool place to want to be. That explains it because now they have this boring
4445.82,4451.58," ass playgrounds with all those like prefab, you know, IKEA assembly shits like a pit of balls."
4451.58,4456.0599999999995, And but they used to before like they would have like Mayor Mitch cheese on the spring and you could
4456.0599999999995,4459.9," rock back and forth on there. Yeah, I don't have that. So what's happened right down here?"
4459.9,4465.74," Mayor Mitch cheese has you know, so then like they must not have had the puppet idea"
4465.74,4469.179999999999, until they went to the Croft. I don't know understand of why they would sue
4469.98,4474.86, City Marty Croft sued or whatever the name of the company was sued for you know
4474.94,4482.46, for basically stealing the idea of of of of puppets of of the HR poppin stuff of of it being too similar
4482.46,4488.54, too close to HR poppin stuff and then you're falling prey to some like urban legend or something.
4488.54,4494.62, I'm not going to tell you go hey Google it or Wikipedia they're not around anymore so hey I only speak
4494.62,4499.66, the truth here on GMP radio because it's scared people like what they did Donald that's a pedophile
4499.74,4505.9, looking dude right there the fry guys tell us what I'm saying right I'm a clone yeah if kids can
4505.9,4510.22, he sit my lap right everybody knows clowns are scary pedophiles.
4511.98,4517.18, Well maybe not all clowns if you're a clowning or listening to this I don't mean you yeah that all
4517.18,4523.5, clowns are bad just all clowns I have to look at for those bad people are clowns.
4523.98,4529.0199999999995, Some Nelson have a dance for we oh yeah you got me thinking of that bar room there was a
4529.02,4537.02, time I remember we were in there some irresponsible parent put their like toddler in there
4537.02,4544.3, the kid was still wearing like diaper training pants and like it came loose and you see the
4544.3,4549.34, feces on the ball and then when it gets on those it spreads like you know if you got a bugger on
4549.34,4553.5, your finger and you're trying to use another finger to remove it and it's just like pretty soon it
4553.5,4558.14, was kind of like the entire ballroom was in danger of becoming brown and everyone but the way that
4558.22,4562.14, everyone ran out conversation I think it was red because in terms of like you know analogical
4562.14,4567.42, thinking at the time I was like this is just like the same exact effect that you get in a regular
4567.42,4573.5, pool of water when something went a baby roof floats to the surface you know but everyone was
4573.5,4578.06, crap everyone was like running the jumping out like there was like a shark or something in there
4579.26,4584.9400000000005, because they know it was a little spread he's contagious it's not it's actually then the kid
4585.58,4590.0599999999995, I remember we got out and everyone looks back in and he's like this is kid nearby himself laughing
4590.86,4596.0599999999995, laughing and well because he was funny he was like in there by himself okay he owned it
4597.66,4606.46, all right we can we can segue from this show we went to it's spoiler time we need the spoiler time music
4608.139999999999,4612.62, we're gonna we're gonna as requested from the users we're gonna talk about
4613.58,4618.78, Half-Life 2 episode 2 in portal in game stuff if you haven't played it through the ending you
4618.78,4622.54, don't want to know you don't want to hear us talk about it then just stop now and don't
4622.94,4625.58, don't complain if you're hearing something you don't want to hear okay
4626.22,4644.78, it's been so long since I finished the game you know we're waiting for everyone else to finish it and waiting
4644.78,4650.78, not just among us but among out there you have a winner listeners that I do remember but I mean
4650.78,4655.5, I'm sure I had a lot more to say at the time to get us going on of course the biggest event at the
4655.5,4661.9, end of episode two is that Eli Vance is killed a way to go so we just hit our spoiler
4661.9,4668.7, and a lot of people I saw a few people you know saying I just changed it from a lot to a few
4669.34,4674.78, but to be honest yes I saw a few people saying that that was utterly predictable I don't think so at all
4675.099999999999,4679.099999999999, yeah so I just wanted to sound off with you guys because it caught me off guard I was like wow
4679.18,4683.9800000000005, to come after I thought it was one of the great endings this year you know like where's the flashback
4683.9800000000005,4689.02, or where's the point when it's like the g-man just throwing some like potential future
4689.820000000001,4694.54, vision of a potential future in your mind but I was like no I thought it was particularly great the
4694.54,4700.620000000001, way they handled it which was which was very movie like in that like you made it through everything's
4700.620000000001,4707.02, great you really thought you were at the ending but then but then bam and then it just ended that way
4707.02,4713.18, it's like man I mean it really ended on this kind of like oh fuck like crazy man yeah it was a very
4713.18,4719.740000000001, empire you got trashed that yeah and then it was yeah but it didn't even end with like yeah I mean it's like
4719.740000000001,4727.660000000001, what so what now yeah what now you know the biggest dilemma they're going to have going forward is that
4728.540000000001,4733.9800000000005, they have to create repercussions for this death mainly through you know Alex I mean that through
4733.98,4738.94, Eli's daughter Alex and the way it's worse so far an episode one and two you've been with Alex
4738.94,4743.58, for almost entirety of the gameplay the exception of one you know episode two when Alex isn't
4743.58,4748.62, pastated herself and they play with you that way they're like duh yeah because the trailer is after
4748.62,4753.0199999999995, episode one made it look like Alex was gonna die or that's right it's gonna die and so like after
4753.0199999999995,4758.139999999999, that you're like okay that was the tease so she didn't die and they did that and that's why it
4758.139999999999,4761.74, worked for me when you like that because I was like okay I see how it is they're like they're
4761.82,4766.86, gonna do the GI Joe thing where it looks like people are gonna die but parachute always opens
4766.86,4771.179999999999, when you're playing loads up you know like in the GI Joe cartoons nothing ever blew up without
4771.179999999999,4775.82, without the parachute parachute in this guy so it's like okay well there's Alex parachute and then
4775.82,4782.0599999999995, you know it through it all you know I think they're gonna do that if you like that but you know no
4782.0599999999995,4786.46, you think dead but what I'm saying is that when now if you have episode three and you continue to
4786.46,4791.9, spend your time with Alex you have this challenge because that's one thing to make her
4793.1,4799.1, seem nervous that enemies might attack or strike or to make her seem confident when she's fighting
4799.1,4803.66, enemies but to have her with you the whole time when her dad was just brutally murdered in
4803.66,4809.26, front of her own eyes is the character is the technology I believe the writing I have every faith
4809.26,4813.74, and you know the self-sacrifice of the game but I don't know if the technology the character
4813.82,4819.0199999999995, to vote and then based on what you're doing so like think about it think about this way say you
4819.0199999999995,4823.9, are writing and you're creating up so three and you need to you have to deal with this this death
4824.78,4829.9, is creating waves throughout you know the lives of all the other cast that you that you work with
4829.9,4833.34, so one way would be to then okay all of a sudden Alex is not with you all the time that way
4833.34,4838.46, when you do see her in limited circumstances they can have set pieces where she can be clearly
4838.46,4841.9, morning or something but but then she doesn't have to be shooting a gun at hunters and at the
4841.9,4846.78, same time being like oh god my dad because everyone's gonna have different expectations for
4846.78,4851.98, the appropriate degree of warning will first of all if if there if the game if episode three
4851.98,4857.82, continues right where it left off there's still the whole just the survival aspect right I mean
4857.82,4862.219999999999, in real life you just learn anything you would be going she's got to deal with these immediate
4862.219999999999,4866.86, I will I will agree later at some point that later that's gonna have to happen in episode three though
4866.86,4870.299999999999, yeah she might just have to get through you know the other hell that she's in and it's kind of
4870.3,4876.22, push it to the back of her mind right but that makes me doubt that she's going to be with you the
4876.22,4880.860000000001, entire time that's because of that it's like there were stretches where they have where she's
4880.860000000001,4886.3, I'm gonna go off this way you go here Gordon but not not even just that more like okay say for
4886.3,4892.22, example you can know that it picks up immediately you're still worried about your own life and it's just
4892.22,4896.3, quiet and then you get to this point where soon as you catch a breath you look at her and it's like
4897.26,4903.34, oh hey how is she doing yeah then maybe you have this point when she does show the emotion and then you've
4903.34,4907.900000000001, got to get her out because as soon as they have her coping with it it's like it I don't know I mean this is just
4907.900000000001,4912.46, guessing but I mean the other problem is that you have no personality right I mean Gordon doesn't ever
4912.46,4918.62, express you can't do any kind of a conversation you can do anything to acknowledge I was thinking about
4918.62,4923.26, that I was like well what if I mean because it's having you with someone has been working really well
4923.34,4928.3, for them and I was wondering well like what about options of having I was like every time dogs been with you
4928.860000000001,4935.26, there's always been some the equivalent of an interpreter you know Alex usually to say what he's
4935.26,4940.62, doing and what she say to give him some to anthropomorphism and give him some sense of like motivation
4940.62,4945.26, and feeling and stuff so I was thinking about Han Solo to this is there any yeah yeah exactly so what if
4945.26,4950.54, you're just with like what if like Luke was just kicking with Chobak on his own so what if there's
4950.86,4955.42, sections where you're with dog and then that seems like you could have fun with it where
4956.22,4961.26, then you could have them do all these things without that explanatory device there where you have to
4961.26,4965.18, figure it out is he doing what I think he's doing oh that's cool and then you could really mess with
4965.18,4972.38, people you know and you can do I think you could do fun stuff with that and especially as a character where
4972.38,4978.86, you're not sure how deep deeply it is able to feel or if he feels or like what's programming
4978.94,4984.38, and what's not yeah I could be really cool say I mean like yeah I mean even they could even throw
4984.38,4989.179999999999, one a thing where like what if it worked like the airlines and it's up its dog you know for like
4989.179999999999,4995.339999999999, what if you can for 15 minutes you know one battle or what if you ended up stuck somehow with the
4995.339999999999,5002.0599999999995, character like uh who's what's his new name what's his name the new character Mike Newson yeah like
5002.0599999999995,5007.98, what if you ended up with him for a while just you in that piece shit where which one is Magnuson
5008.0599999999995,5014.78, he's the black mace of scientists who invented the Magnuson device the striter bomb and he's
5014.78,5020.299999999999, you know he's full of himself he's holding a grudge against you for from melting his casserole
5020.299999999999,5027.58, and black mace of right okay and everything that comes out of his mouth is just about how great he is
5028.139999999999,5033.58, it's like yeah so imagine that would be fun imagine if you're stuck with him and of course he's like
5033.66,5039.18, he's spyingless too so if he's in some situation where his life's in danger rather than having
5040.0599999999995,5046.38, you know confident Alex there watching your six and in shooting it's like lots of space you got
5046.38,5052.7, a robot or you got doctor's mettersmith right right exactly yeah you're right so
5052.7,5060.38, there's a thinking about that of course now we know that they're going to uh the borealis right the ship
5060.54,5066.62, interestingly if you read the raising the bar art book that was planned in the half-life
5066.62,5073.74, lore from the very beginning it was it was on level and even the Arctic stuff too taking this
5073.74,5077.66, boat we're always sort of like planned to be part of half-life too it's interesting to seem coming
5077.66,5082.06, back to it and the way it's set up of course is that you're going to the borealis because
5082.06,5087.1, the portal device is on there right something made by aperture science either the portal device or
5087.18,5094.22, something probably probably cool so then that leads to the question of well what happens when you
5094.22,5100.14, put a portal device into half-life I mean how can they get and I can't imagine them doing it not
5100.9400000000005,5106.46, I can't imagine giving it to you for longer than like one really tight level very restricted access
5106.46,5110.54, and we don't need to do that totally get happened you think we'll get a portal device so I think
5110.54,5114.620000000001, in some ways where the portal was like a probing ground for that technology and now like
5115.5,5120.3, in my head like adding guns and fighting into that even for if it's in like just in arena
5120.3,5125.26, like really tightly nice balv arena yeah for one level would be awesome and that level could
5125.26,5130.14, very well be inside the borealis right because with the portal gun you have to have an enclosed
5130.14,5137.66, environment right and that could be and you want to restrict access so like I imagine say you go there
5137.66,5142.54, you get it you fight your way out of the borealis using it in that level incorporates and then
5142.54,5146.86, you handed over to someone else right and that takes away from you but yeah it would be great I
5146.86,5151.1, mean imagine like a half-life level where you're fighting or something inside the ship and you're able
5151.1,5156.86, to instead of just dropping something through a portal on the head of a turret you're doing things to
5157.9,5163.26, keep guys chasing you I mean whatever sort of emergent things you could work out you know in this
5163.26,5168.06, environment to they throw a grenade at your feet you just drop that you put a portal at your feet
5168.06,5170.86, put a portal over their head the grenade falls on their head that they're just going to shoot
5171.82,5176.299999999999, in that enclosed environment you could do so many things and I think that would be great and I kind of expected
5176.299999999999,5180.54, I would be surprised if it wasn't I suppose that would be the hinting right I mean
5181.179999999999,5184.78, because the portal itself mentioned the borealis right
5185.58,5188.62, did they really what I don't think it mentioned oh yeah let's know I think it was more like
5188.62,5193.9, and so to do you know they meant that it was aperture signs like you're looking for something from
5193.9,5199.58, this other rival okay I can remember which made the reference that aperture science is a rival
5199.82,5203.58, to all right mace you see that in that room and that they were all like they wanted
5203.58,5207.9, they're competing for the same you know the same government funding right and they each had these
5207.9,5212.7, teleporter technology of some of their bolsterect like teleporting right and then those two
5212.7,5217.9, thing is the story is now what is the portal gun going to do because all the characters like we need this
5217.9,5223.34, in our like what a fine why we need to figure out and they need to explain
5224.62,5229.34, maybe it's not the portal gun you know something this is interesting to throw out now I guess
5229.34,5235.5, it kind of fits the guy who transcribes who does you know transcription for sometimes we do extended
5235.5,5241.34, interviews and we'll need this transcribed his close friend allegedly looked at the
5241.34,5245.74, got to look at the entire I don't know where he worked but through some connection he looked the entire
5245.74,5252.38, half life two story not half life two half life series story bible in which allegedly everything
5252.38,5258.54, with g-man's worked out everything is all there all down and said like you will not you cannot be
5258.54,5265.1, more satisfied than you will be so this could be I don't know this could be total bullshit but
5265.1,5269.82, like if you if you even have like the slightest tendency don't want that to be the case it's
5269.82,5274.62, you need to be like yeah okay right yeah I can't wait you know you're not going to get the x files here
5274.62,5280.3, and they know yeah they know that I mean they know that they uh uh reminds me about they have the same
5280.3,5287.34, kind of pressure that the alost folks have don't they yeah pretty much so they said a lot we don't know
5287.42,5294.62, episode they said that the the trilogy of episodes in their entirety is the equivalent of half life three
5295.34,5299.58, yeah but you don't know I mean it's like they've been working after at this point they'll
5299.58,5306.14, of basically been made three games half life half life two in the episodes and you know how you
5306.14,5310.22, know extraordinarily creative the people of Valvard it's like we'll do they want to do something else
5310.22,5316.38, at this point or maybe they've got more to it maybe like that story bible goes a lot further
5316.46,5322.86, than we're guessing and that there's stuff that's really out there you know maybe um or though
5322.86,5326.46, they'll want to do a bunch of stuff like portal then maybe they'll they'll have a year where they make
5327.1,5330.38, the equivalent of like three or four ports yeah what what they want to do one year
5330.38,5335.34, radically changed what I wonder if portal this and the success of portal and the the reception
5335.34,5341.1, to portal it changed changed their thinking at all you know oh my god they have to yeah they always
5341.18,5346.860000000001, listen to to their audience and both directly by soliciting their their commentary and then also just
5346.860000000001,5351.740000000001, by looking at what they do you know how many what what time how many how much time are they
5351.740000000001,5356.620000000001, spend on these maps what classes do they play in team fortress I mean they're they're basically
5356.620000000001,5362.22, gathering this data from so many different points and and it's got to be deciding from there
5362.22,5366.14, baffling or goofy or maybe even someone to some people on some level disappointing that like
5367.02,5373.02, portal grabbed so much of the attention when like I guess the you know episode two is kind of what
5373.02,5377.900000000001, you would consider before this came out the flagship right piece of the orange box but like all
5377.900000000001,5382.780000000001, of the internet noise and all the discussion afterwards was like you have to play portal yeah
5382.780000000001,5387.18, which was in all our heads like the little thing uh the electric thing and it's then you know
5387.18,5390.62, turned out to more than it obviously but I think that's what people were watching out to be kidding yeah
5390.62,5395.02, how do you what do you do with that it valve to review mill is like the last one I wanted to play
5395.5,5399.5, you know right all the contents well when we were first talking about it when when orange box
5399.5,5405.34, and even black box were first around portal was this kind of like yeah little it looks neat
5405.34,5411.34, but like some kind of extra yeah and and it's it's funny because I've been very portal
5411.34,5416.22, centric these days are just thinking about it a lot and talking about half life two episode two
5416.22,5422.22, here just reminds me how how great that was and and just how to me the half life series has
5422.22,5427.66, just gotten better and better you know every time they do it it gets better and I can't think
5427.66,5433.820000000001, of many other series that you could say that about yeah I don't know I don't agree with the way
5433.820000000001,5440.38, that I think that that episode two is underplayed for whatever reason I think that when you look
5440.38,5445.740000000001, at the shooters that came out this year you know single player games it's how do it's it's phenomenal
5445.740000000001,5450.54, I mean if you that the same people that went crazy for company here a single player and stuff like
5450.86,5456.22, the episode two is a much much better game in my opinion on the single player you know
5456.22,5459.74, comparing it to company here I mean call duties
5460.94,5464.54, company here is not running away you were sitting there I said they'll call duty right
5465.18,5470.86, they're campaign I call duty had a good campaign I mean I thought it was it was a pretty
5470.86,5475.82, pretty great game but but I do think that the the half life's do sort of exist in their own
5476.54,5481.66, they sort of have their own realm of greatness yeah I just just many people that that were like
5482.299999999999,5487.74, oh god this has changed the way I look at you know games and stuff the COD it's funny now I'm
5487.74,5493.98, starting now it's getting its backlash I'm starting to see capital you know talking about like
5493.98,5498.299999999999, oh you know this is really more annoying than people were saying at first this being you know the
5498.299999999999,5503.58, infinite the spawn of closets and the tendency for the enemies to just bombard you with grenade spam
5503.9,5510.7, but also the fact that for the multiplayer everyone I think that's in the know that played you know
5511.26,5517.18, COD 2 extensively and you know United offensive before that and stuff like that yeah this is
5517.18,5522.54, multiplayer's cool but it's COD and and that's what we want that's fine but it's not like
5523.26,5527.0199999999995, gonna make us react to the level that we see some of these other people like oh my god this is like the
5527.0199999999995,5532.54, greatest thing ever I can't believe how good this is and then I almost without fail every time I hear
5532.62,5537.9, that I ask people is this your first experience with COD and it always is so that's kind of the
5537.9,5542.46, thing there it's like oh I see the difference because we've been I'm used to this for the past five
5542.46,5548.14, years I've been doing this final fantasy 7 syndrome final exactly yeah for for people who love
5548.14,5553.9, final fantasy all along when when that happened although final fantasy 7 I think was different was like
5554.86,5560.62, much it was it was more different from final fantasy 6 and the preceding final fantasies and COD 4 is
5560.7,5566.46, from COD yeah I mean they're basically in that like that one exact they would work if you just
5566.46,5572.78, put in the weapon set for COD 2 in the map so it'd be basically the same you know you'd feel
5572.78,5576.78, and they even they even know that they brought like STG 44 is one of the weapons you can unlock in
5576.78,5582.22, COD 4 I still think it's a great game but I don't know why I got on that it's just like
5582.22,5588.94, okay prepared to for me episode 2 was it was a better single player FPS experience one thing to
5588.94,5592.46, back you'd up a second where you're talking about trends for the year I did bring the sin from you
5592.46,5597.179999999999, know the last time I interviewed Gabe Newell and I thought this was interesting on the tech side which we
5598.0599999999995,5602.299999999999, we don't like it's not that we underrepresented but we're just none of us are like extreme tech
5602.299999999999,5610.299999999999, heads you know Darren is but he's not with us anymore right and Gabe's vision of the future
5610.299999999999,5616.7, for for PC gaming he's in the hardware side was interesting so he's saying that um let's quote from
5616.78,5621.179999999999, this response now that couple of technology changes are on the horizon and I think a big market
5621.179999999999,5625.9, changes about to occur on the technology side we're going to move away from the current heterogenous
5625.9,5629.82, computing environment and move to homogeneous computing where you have a single memory address
5629.82,5634.78, space in a single set of instructions for your AI and rendering the good news I suspect we'll see
5634.78,5639.179999999999, a significant improvement scalability and the pace at which game technology moves forward will increase
5639.179999999999,5644.22, as a result of the transition so what what that means there's that by the the whole heterogene
5644.22,5650.14, you know a modulating thing is that right now you have a GPU which is your graphics card
5651.26,5656.46, companies tried to physics try to sell a special physics processor you've got you know
5657.26,5661.9800000000005, your CPU's handling some of it you've got audio cards and he's basically saying that you're going
5661.9800000000005,5667.820000000001, to have a single your your processors your multicore processors are going to handle all of this
5667.820000000001,5672.7, right and that's going to be one that's going to reduce an entry barrier because you're not going
5672.7,5677.34, to need to go and buy all these separate things and you know and it's also going to allow
5677.34,5683.34, it I'll continue reading from it allow developers to do a lot more and make new sorts of engines
5683.34,5690.94, so he says um you know right now we have CPU API GPU and then people are trying to argue that
5690.94,5695.74, there should be PPE's AI accelerators and other things we think it's going to go the other way
5695.74,5701.26, where somebody figures out how to generalize GPU course or somebody who makes multicore CPUs that
5701.34,5707.42, also handle rendering scalability will stop being a hardware problem will become a software problem
5707.42,5711.58, how well can we take advantage of all these cores and that's good news is it means the same
5711.58,5716.54, performance games that we've seen in graphics since three effects will now apply to every aspect
5716.54,5721.18, of game engines as well and I think you'll see a proliferation of very different approaches to
5721.18,5726.06, building game engines right now the structure of game engines are all pretty similar you'll see some
5726.06,5730.22, wildly different approaches once we move into this homogeneous environment we'll continue to get
5730.3,5734.54, better and better pictures but we'll also see more and better I mean we'll also see more and more
5734.54,5739.26, interesting games so I mean that's an interesting idea too there that if you get the kind of breakthroughs
5739.26,5747.02, that we had with the 3D effects card but with physics I mean with AI yeah these other things that's
5747.02,5753.58, pretty exciting so we'll see I mean he could be I mean obviously games uh in both informed and intelligent
5753.9,5758.7, yeah some he's made I'm not sure about his track record for predicting the future
5758.7,5767.58, I mean but definitely seems like a plausible future yes and that seems interesting it might also have
5767.58,5772.54, far-reaching ramifications on you know not just the way that games are made but also on the
5772.54,5779.18, viability of certain kinds of games in the PC market I believe what Gabe says
5779.5,5787.58, you know I will follow Mr. Mueller. I have no counter argument for Gabe so we kind of did the
5787.9800000000005,5792.46, spoiler thing on but before we moved to portal last thing there's this other item at the end of
5792.46,5799.900000000001, half life too episode two and that's uh when the G-man has a few things to say to you right before
5799.900000000001,5807.740000000001, I uh Eli is killed but even Eli didn't know what he meant this time so do you guys gonna bring that
5807.82,5815.5, up every week so what did uh Sean your own your eyes what did he say he basically rolled through
5815.5,5821.179999999999, G-man and rolled through and yeah he this is the part about wanting to talk about as soon as I got
5821.179999999999,5825.9, done playing it it seemed that he was to drug your memory saying that you know like at reviving
5825.9,5833.74, Alex was his he enabled that and that she's part of his plan and that he's using her and but further
5833.74,5840.78, more Eli was aware that the G-man exists and was using her oh right I mean am I remembering this correctly
5841.42,5848.54, this is what was like intimately through the conversation after that vision you quickly speak with Eli
5848.54,5856.54, alone when Alex isn't present and it seemed to me to suggest like I know what's up but then he's
5856.54,5861.74, dead so you don't ever know. Doesn't he get cut off because Alex returns right and he has to stop
5862.219999999999,5866.62, that line of tension yeah and then they have you think you go out and he dies okay the dramatic thread right
5866.62,5871.34, there and say you may never know the answer to this question yeah so were you getting all lost on that
5871.34,5877.5, shit not lost is in the loss but in the TV show is that willing to willing to sit there and figure out
5877.5,5885.74, if it was the damn dog who is actually Jacob in the cabin I don't know I mean there's you could either say
5885.74,5890.46, he's manipulating you and just lying and just using that as another way to manipulate you or
5890.46,5894.7, maybe he's telling the truth you know you just I have no idea I mean also that he was that you
5894.7,5900.38, I knew about his involvement in the original black mesa incident like from the very beginning when
5900.38,5907.9800000000005, the thing went bonkers right when the experiment went bonkers I've been lost by the G-man
5908.62,5914.46, half like one frankly I just wanted to know I don't I mean like a part enough for that plot line I just
5914.46,5918.02, hear I see him in here I'm in a m-ha I'm talking like a-
5918.02,5923.42, Jeff you still looking at Alex is that what's pretty much that's it I'm just writing
5923.42,5928.22, our angle I he's talking getting a better angle on her ass he's yeah he's just one of
5928.22,5932.62, those impenetraple mysteries to me so I'm kind of leaving him into that yeah not speculating on
5932.62,5936.38, it yeah he doesn't trigger like I think they put that in there because they want to encourage
5936.38,5942.06, you I think they probably realize that now he's just this like inscrutable and igman that
5942.14,5946.22, you're like I don't they don't I don't think they want you to say he's just this mystery
5946.22,5949.820000000001, don't worry about him it'll all be resolved I think they want you to invest some effort in
5949.820000000001,5954.54, the figure out what the fuck is he up to how many strings has he been pulling into what
5954.54,5959.820000000001, ends you know I'm kind of not a long for that right I'm just sort of tell me when you guys are
5959.820000000001,5963.660000000001, ready to tell me what the fuck this is I'll listen but do you like even okay so if that's your
5963.660000000001,5970.06, perspective are you still like oh yeah I do yeah I do I like there's that funny man again pretty much
5970.06,5974.780000000001, yeah when I'm up to funny fun man exactly yeah it's probably gonna say something like
5974.780000000001,5982.38, look at a shiny object yeah his voice is weird exactly well I don't know the reason is because
5982.38,5987.740000000001, I felt like after I guess it was for after episode not episode two half life too
5989.1,5993.740000000001, like oh they're not gonna really give they're gonna doll out the information so stingy yeah
5993.740000000001,5998.3, I'm just not gonna get that invested in this guy yeah it's a clearly kind of fucking with us
5998.3,6002.22, and I kind of give you more yeah and I kind of those kind of characters and you know
6002.22,6007.42, very similar mysteries that just whatever they do give you I'm always suspicious that they're
6007.42,6011.26, giving it to you as a red herring anyway yeah just like well they wouldn't tell me this if that was
6011.26,6014.78, what it was what it was really was right it's a little bit I mean that's how it was did it and
6014.78,6018.7, that's how they ended up being a lost backlash until they kind of corrected themselves a little
6018.7,6023.02, bit but they were doing a lot of like well we're gonna give you this information but actually
6023.02,6027.66, that doesn't really mean anything well the trick is is to hear what's in the hat but I think it's
6027.66,6031.66, interesting I'm not saying no no yeah I'm fucked jeemere and last one no I'm not saying
6031.66,6036.139999999999, fucked jeemere when they give you something and it is relevant information but what it does is
6036.139999999999,6041.0199999999995, it at when they answer one question it proposes two more questions or they have enough
6041.9,6048.38, overlapping sets of mysteries sure that delivering on one of them at any given time isn't going
6048.38,6051.98, to ruin it because you still have these other ones there that you can intensify or something
6051.98,6056.86, yeah I'm completely fine with open-ended mysteries I have no I was not one of the people who needed
6057.339999999999,6062.139999999999, I did not get frustrated by lost extending it I wasn't one of those people I didn't even care
6063.179999999999,6068.78, back in twin peaks day I did not need them to resolve Laura Palmer's murder right away right so
6068.78,6074.299999999999, I don't mind an open-ended mystery but in the case of the jeemere I just wish there was a little
6074.299999999999,6080.299999999999, more to grasp here yeah I think we even know if this guy is actually like a real physical
6080.299999999999,6084.46, manifestation on earth or is he just something and Gordon Freeman's brain do we even know that much
6084.46,6088.78, he's just flashback from when Gordon Freeman was dropping acid in his physics class
6090.54,6096.78, his father yeah so I always say father I hope that they be looks like by the time
6096.78,6102.46, I mean episode three of course they will really want to bring resolution not to the entire thing
6102.46,6110.14, but they want to it's got a wrap up maybe he's going in the future a lot of people that was one
6110.46,6115.9800000000005, I'm sure that's come up really yeah that'd be such a cliche I don't I don't see any evidence that
6115.9800000000005,6121.660000000001, that's what it is really through me that when the whole theory when when Valve shot down the the whole idea
6121.660000000001,6129.42, of it chill from portal oh was Alex's Alex's mom yeah because she has kind of a similar skin tone and
6129.42,6134.62, if you look if you compare her what you could see of her looking through portals at weird angles
6135.42,6139.099999999999, I could see that she looks like that picture of the so now I have utilized why if you know
6140.0599999999995,6144.22, it was like this could be really interesting and then when I got there wasn't game
6144.22,6151.58, you all just like what yeah every the portal the portal guys you know uh we're like um we're not
6151.58,6156.0599999999995, gonna say of course if this was the case we wouldn't say and then after we're after that day of
6156.0599999999995,6162.0599999999995, interviewing everyone I spoke with game alone and keeps like oh no that's not it and then you
6162.06,6167.820000000001, could kind of tell you's like oh I never thought of that one so yeah so like maybe the portal
6167.820000000001,6174.14, guys you're like that's a good idea oh shit Gabe said no and that's maybe he's the GMM maybe
6174.14,6180.54, he's gone to be in episode three that seems like unlikely they didn't be part of but
6180.54,6185.580000000001, maybe something about her it's the ending of portal that's just some portal spartan right like
6185.580000000001,6190.860000000001, when you land on the ground out after you know bris is in building blowing up
6190.86,6195.179999999999, yeah like out in what looks like you know hey I'm in half life too now I mean like an
6195.179999999999,6198.94, environment that looks like I could be in it in half life too so I got the sense that maybe this
6198.94,6204.0599999999995, will connect I don't know if it's true or not but do we know the exact time frame that portal takes
6204.0599999999995,6209.58, place in we know it's after the disaster black mesa right but it's clearly before the combine
6209.58,6213.9, invasion right I don't know I don't know is it I mean if it's in such its own bubble and they
6213.9,6217.82, even though you know because we were trying to like really nerd out and get lost with it and I
6217.82,6222.219999999999, would say that like well the energy orbs that are used inside the portal and the aperture
6222.219999999999,6227.66, facility are those that the combine used to power their technology and like combine slip slip
6227.66,6233.66, these fools this technology in the same way that like GMM had had some hand in the event
6233.66,6239.82, at black mesa and they were just like that's just happy coincidence we just just to suit
6239.82,6245.82, it's just a set of super cool shape and not in the half life universe so I don't know about
6246.139999999999,6253.66, and I don't know I can't imagine that she's going to be in it but I can't I can again and again
6253.66,6258.94, if they have the portal is in the she's not a counter though like they would essentially have to
6258.94,6264.78, invent a character for this person should I already messed up yeah that's the portal kick
6264.78,6269.58, yeah you you would imagine she would speak in like clipped monoslavic language you'd speak like the
6269.58,6277.26, GMM about KELOLAND the GMM was actually one of cladus's subjects oh shit that's it there it is
6277.26,6281.58, someone out there though if I didn't say oh shit would have been like telling their friends
6283.0199999999995,6287.9, that's it that's it we figured it out like the best when I talk about the dog this is because
6288.94,6295.34, when people were all trying to figure out uh who so in lost there's this character named Jacob it's
6295.58,6300.860000000001, non-character people talk about him lost spoilers coming yes yes lost lost not a season
6300.860000000001,6306.22, correct so they go in into this cabin lot goes into this cabin just to allegedly see the
6306.22,6311.18, guy and it's actually the last episode of season three isn't it no when they go to check it's like
6311.18,6316.7, second to last oh really it's that early okay that early second to last oh second I think it's
6316.7,6323.42, six to last so he so they see this fool and one of they don't they go to see this fool and it's just
6323.42,6329.74, this empty chair and then who's the guy who's been talking to to the empty chair but if you watch
6329.74,6335.34, then things start going haywire like some uh right at first you're thinking like he's hot okay
6335.34,6339.74, so Ben's what lock is that like oh my god Ben is Ben just a fine balloon right there's nothing here
6339.74,6344.46, they're the cabin starts shaking and the chairs rocking and there's this people like
6344.46,6349.74, tea vote it and pause didn't you get this flash of a person's eyes like a pirate looking back
6349.74,6356.139999999999, but so everyone on the for on the lost form is was like trying to say judging from this eye
6356.139999999999,6360.86, who is this an island that we know and they were comparing it and they're like okay and we're
6360.86,6366.7, it's lock look it's locked or they're like no it's uh that's already free of the characters after
6366.7,6371.66, one second somebody said it was a saying it was Desmond other people were saying that it was jack's father
6372.38,6376.3, you know and a lot of people were saying it was jack's father but then this one dude
6376.78,6381.02, so what they were doing what they weren't just saying it they were actually taking
6381.02,6387.58, stills of these other cast numbers and then cutting out their cutting out the eye of Jacob that
6387.58,6392.9400000000005, was shown and super imposing that of the characters for the match so someone actually took the
6392.9400000000005,6400.62, fucking dog's eye and superimposed that superimposed that ghost eye over the dog and it actually
6400.7,6408.7, matched them so that's yeah that's that's what's happening when we're thinking that the
6408.7,6416.7, g-man is a man is blacksponger is gay bee from aperture yeah so anything else about a portal
6417.42,6423.5, I liked it it's funny so what's the cake other in the lie don't say that or I'll be upset with you
6423.58,6430.38, cakes good well now what did you take it to me what did you believe that it's 75
6430.38,6434.14, ruin to get to me now is my reward for getting through this damn dungeon
6435.02,6442.06, do you think it okay did you get um actually read a uh I read a cake at the end the wiki
6442.06,6448.7, entry about about portal reason for a lot of good so the guy that's that photo shop the dog in the eye
6449.58,6455.82, pretty much yeah what they said according to with competing you take it for what it's worth that uh
6457.42,6463.42, supposedly when the when the design team a portal was asked uh you know about the cake you know
6463.42,6469.179999999999, where did this come from the the answer was that they had an early design meeting and
6470.46,6475.099999999999, where they were sitting around and they they had said they were saying like well okay so what's the
6475.42,6479.18, theme of the scheme gonna be what what's gonna be about what does you know what's the player's
6479.18,6484.38, goal gonna be and that there was dead silence at the table and then somebody said oh everybody likes cake
6485.58,6491.42, there you go that's that's how it was happening just happy that way but that makes sense it's possible
6491.42,6496.54, do they shine but what yeah I think there's a reference side it yeah that doesn't necessarily mean
6496.54,6501.900000000001, that that's what it is but then you get a repomboard and maybe they breathe him and they're an
6501.98,6507.5, air being in the writer and they say this is what we know he got this game you do puzzles and it's
6507.5,6512.78, for cake and so then he could take and run with it and then you get the cake as it is now
6513.5,6519.9, where it then becomes as in my reading of it at least is just you know like poking fun at the whole
6521.5,6528.219999999999, sort of you know absurd nature of goals and games anyway yeah rewards you know and that that there
6528.780000000001,6533.34, whatever it is that you're fighting for in any game is just a loose arena is just something thrown
6533.34,6538.3, there it's the same way that they came yeah my girlfriend that they came up with the cake you know so
6539.34,6542.54, and I thought that was fun and in the same kind of way that when you're playing you know the
6542.54,6549.900000000001, bioshock toyed with you and said you have no agency you know you have no you're you're room for
6549.900000000001,6555.42, deciding and acting is remarkably limited and restricted in video games and we're going to turn
6555.42,6560.06, that into a theme for the story of our game and then similarly this is the same well you play
6560.06,6564.46, games for the experience so that's kind of like it's about the journey not the end is another ironically
6564.46,6570.38, way of saying the ending of portal is whatever one and by making the ending that comment that it's
6570.38,6575.9800000000005, about the journey not the ending the ending itself became worthwhile right yeah which is part of the
6575.9800000000005,6582.9400000000005, fun and I think why in addition to the song why everyone responded so well too it just was it was
6583.099999999999,6588.139999999999, it was the perfect journey with the perfect ending you know the journey the the journey was
6588.139999999999,6594.219999999999, brilliant the entire way through and then at the boss at the point in which it was already like this
6594.219999999999,6599.419999999999, yeah this could be the greatest boss ever this has been nothing but fun all the way through then
6599.419999999999,6604.7, there was the cherry on the cake of that of that song I mean I think the moment for me that clicked
6604.7,6610.94, that this game was just genius was you finish number nineteen or whatever you're descending into the
6610.94,6616.94, incinerator and you get out that moment was choice and then she's like you know she's like oh yeah
6616.94,6621.5, we weren't really going to burn you that hole I can't even begin to like yeah the comment timing that was
6621.5,6627.98, sure that was too awesome like that was the moment I was like I love this game wholeheartedly yeah
6627.98,6631.98, and that was maybe halfway through because then you have pretty much the rest of the adventure not inside
6631.98,6637.339999999999, of the sterile rooms but inside of the yeah I actually in my my my my right up it's no surprise
6637.82,6643.900000000001, ten you want to say that this made it is on the top ten so I'm spoiledly the portal but I said
6643.900000000001,6649.82, that this was actually a game that that most of us didn't just like but actually fell in love with
6649.82,6654.22, we're right about it it's trends too we could have also had we we have all these other trends
6654.22,6658.38, we've outlined we have to talk about now but another one could have been unreliable narrators and games
6659.18,6664.7, oh yeah this is like between yeah it's like they got like extreme my legit of unreliable
6664.7,6668.7, it is which is something that's just of course you know I thought it was particularly
6668.7,6672.94, brilliant part of fiction for quite some time and I thought it was particularly brilliant and portal
6672.94,6678.0599999999995, because you're you're fooled in a way to into thinking for quite a long time in the game that there
6678.0599999999995,6683.42, isn't even a story or a narrator really I mean you're basically just doing your elaborate right
6683.42,6689.58, doing a series of puzzles system shock had its underlabel narrators yes did can they be in like
6689.74,6696.14, those narrators yeah unreliable that's a good enough reason to keep you playing you know so you
6696.14,6702.0599999999995, can get the reality against the the the reality as it was presented to you by that you know
6702.86,6709.26, it's a classic hook so not surprised it keeps going back to it I like it well place it more
6710.0599999999995,6716.7, I want to be the narrator and we'll be in realaible what am I saying I don't know
6717.66,6724.86, I like portal I guess we're done here for the week yes we hope y'all have a a fine week
6725.58,6731.34, in your own selves lives in the last positive notice that we're working on getting a regular schedule going
6731.98,6737.98, so we're aiming to record on Tuesdays and release every Wednesday with regularity with the
6737.98,6743.5, new commitment to regularity that's a good one okay yeah no if we say it then maybe maybe we'll
