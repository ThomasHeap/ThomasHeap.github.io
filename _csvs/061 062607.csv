0.0,5.2, This one-up podcast is brought to you by Games for Windows. Welcome to Better PC Gaming.
5.2,12.6, Created with the idea that gaming should deliver more. Games for Windows branded titles bring you all the fun of gaming without all the work.
12.6,20.6," And with the hottest titles around and Windows Vista compatibility, Games for Windows promises to deliver great new gaming experiences every time you play."
21.6,35.6," Well, my first name is Alan. I prefer a fangirl. I wouldn't say I've lived the most normal life, but I need some one-time bathing in the top at the age of five. Remember right, too?"
35.6,45.6, My mom was watching me somehow made a water in the top forming the bubbles. And you shape a vibe when five would get five somehow did this fight quickly.
46.6,59.6," Now it brings us to the present time. I brought up in the Christian family, but that really didn't fit me. At the moment I am a wick in two years into a much knowledge game so far."
59.6,70.6," I guess I'm watching what call a true figure. Someone who's thanks to understand whatever he can get logic or not, no matter if he goes against my belief and not."
70.6,83.6," Now if for why I'm here, I indeed feel at least 97% that I'm not swimming. Don't like most others I've been comfortable with board. I'm not exactly sure what I am."
83.6,92.6," If it's something I've been wondering for years, I wouldn't need which to know how I can use my magic. If well, why I was able to do them?"
93.6,100.6," Not a problem. The reason why I was simple enough, you have always had a stronger sense of the world than most."
100.6,109.6," When you imagine something and then feel it coming to reality, it really does happen for you. You can manipulate the very reality around you."
109.6,118.6," To be honest, I would not be surprised if you could start turning water to one. I did that once, you didn't change color or anything, but I have the same effects."
118.6,132.6," Very useful at parties. Anyway, all you need to do is learn to focus it. As a child, your imagination is great. If you're able to conjure more elaborate things, it'll take you some time to re-awaken those powers."
132.6,141.6," I suggest starting out small, making your thunderstorm something very simple. Focus and feel."
141.6,154.6, You won't be surprised if you're not everyone can do this. That's why it's denounced as a real occurrence. If just anyone can't duplicate and prove it. It's not real or so they say.
154.6,156.6, I barely made it.
156.6,158.6, Wow.
158.6,162.6, Hello and welcome to DFW Radio.
163.6,165.6, These are the ones that you're getting more serious.
165.6,169.6, That wasn't an intro. That was a hero of the web and it was from an other kid's site.
169.6,181.6," Of course, people who believe that they are reincarnated, but that they're true essence and are true identity is that of some fictional or what we believe we have fictional persona."
181.6,184.6, Apparently that one guy thought he was Jesus or something.
184.6,189.6, They've recently started to realize that they have these epiphanies as they discuss it in the forum.
189.6,194.6, And he realizes that he's a professor or a video character or something like that.
194.6,197.6, So this is a guy on the road to epiphanie.
197.6,201.6, I love the guy who started small with things like thunderstorms.
201.6,203.6, What's the big guy?
203.6,204.6, What's the big guy?
204.6,205.6, Moving plane.
206.6,208.6, So we're here.
208.6,212.6," It's June 26th, 2007."
212.6,217.6, This is one of our notorious deadline podcasts.
217.6,221.6, So we're not going to go as long as we sometimes do.
221.6,227.6," Anyone who complains un-messaged boards, I have a special message to read about that this week and that's a fuck you."
227.6,231.6," That was a really busy, very special message."
231.6,233.6, Very special message from Medio.
233.6,236.6, We'll have a longer one next time.
236.6,239.6, We do have to earn our paycheck with the whole magazine thing.

264.6,265.6, I don't know.
265.6,268.6, He does it at a more vacation time than like a president.
268.6,271.6," I don't know if he can't be, but for another two weeks."
271.6,273.6," I'd see it, Darren."
273.6,276.6," Anyway, alright, okay."

387.6,389.6," Um, and we were going to go."
389.6,391.6," Uh, what was it in Friday?"
391.6,392.6, It was like Wednesday or something.
392.6,393.6, We were going to go see a concert.
393.6,394.6, It was cool.
394.6,395.6," It's about six, five and, uh,"
395.6,396.6, stage france.
396.6,397.6, It's a film more.
397.6,403.6," But as I'm leaving, um, someone, I look over and I see someone running across the street."
403.6,405.6," And I smell like, what's this about?"
405.6,409.6, Guy can ask for change or what directions or something.
409.6,412.6," And, um, so we messed the story."
412.6,416.6," But guy, like, pulls out a, a no pad and a pen."
416.6,419.6," And then he like puts it in my hand and he's like,"
419.6,420.6, You guys are the truth.
420.6,421.6," You know, like, you guys are the truth."
421.6,422.6," You know, like, you guys, and he starts like,"
423.6,425.6," You know, like, whoa, dude, what's going on?"
425.6,428.6," And I realized like, he, uh, you know,"
428.6,429.6," at Hans, my friend was looking like,"
429.6,430.6, how's going on?
430.6,433.6," You know, then we realized he wanted, uh, an autograph."
433.6,436.6," And I was doing, what is going on, man?"
436.6,437.6, This crazy.
437.6,438.6, I didn't want to be right by name.
438.6,439.6, That's where you do.
439.6,442.6, And Hans is back and me up on that.
442.6,445.6," So it turned out, of course, that, yeah,"
445.6,448.6, it was a guy who he's one of our listeners in the fan.
448.6,450.6, And it was cool.
450.6,451.6, And it was a trip in the same time.
451.6,453.6," You know, first of all, like, this is,"
453.6,456.6," this is like what, you know, you see the guy you stepped on a rake"
456.6,458.6, and hit himself in the dick on America's point of view.
458.6,459.6, You see this?
459.6,462.6," I think you're like, let's run and get that guy's autograph."
462.6,465.6, So there was that.
465.6,470.6," But then there's like, okay, but if, if me being the equivalent of that dude,"
470.6,472.6," and still wanted to come over and say,"
472.6,473.6," all right, that's really cool."
473.6,474.6," Like, it was flatter."
474.6,475.6," You're like, hey, you know, that's nice."
475.6,476.6, That's what's going on.
476.6,477.6, That's what you have.
477.6,479.6," Yeah, we have at least one listener, like,"
479.6,480.6, a giant parent.
480.6,481.6," Yeah, tell your parents."
481.6,482.6, And it's telling you when I was getting free.
482.6,483.6," Yeah, I was on a grand."
483.6,486.6," Well, that I told the world I guess, but there's no way,"
486.6,487.6, it was so weird.
487.6,489.6," But also the guy who's listening, like, hey,"
489.6,492.6," man, sorry if I see weird, I just don't know how to,"
492.6,493.6, I didn't know how to respond.
493.6,494.6," That was new to me, you know, it was like, I couldn't,"
494.6,496.6," I couldn't tell you, like, oh, I can't write in there"
496.6,498.6," without seeing him like a dick, but though I could just say,"
498.6,499.6," like, it's trust me, man."
499.6,500.6, I should throw up on him.
500.6,502.6, Makes sense of the really arrogant about it.
502.6,503.6," Well, there's nothing at the end."
503.6,505.6," Yeah, I'll do that anymore."
505.6,507.6, I'm just $5.
507.6,508.6, I saw him $5.
508.6,509.6," I saw him, what I don't grab."
509.6,512.6," Is it checked with the checking bait, it's up there."
512.6,513.6, Yeah.
513.6,515.6, But I know that was cool.
515.6,516.6, It was interesting story.
516.6,517.6, And I hope it was.
517.6,518.6, Congratulations.
518.6,519.6, I like it.
519.6,520.6," It's like, it's like, it's like, you're famous."
520.6,521.6, Is it right?
521.6,523.6," And then, you know, my friend was like, does it happen a lot?"
523.6,525.6," Yeah, because he's not even really much of a gamer."
525.6,528.6," You know, he's like, experimental biologist up in Seattle,"
528.6,529.6, areas at the moment.
529.6,531.6, They probably don't get me any autographs.
531.6,534.6," No, I mean, it's just like, yeah, it's like, what's going on?"
534.6,538.6, I got recognized in Hawaii on a lua with my wife and kid.
538.6,540.6, We heard this one before that.
540.6,541.6," Oh, John, you're standing me."
541.6,543.6," He could've been like, remember how I know that."
543.6,544.6, I think that's so interesting.
544.6,545.6," So, this is something that's like you, Sean."
545.6,547.6," And we had you, we had the airport."
547.6,550.6," You, you're your story of like, you saw someone reading your art."
550.6,551.6, And that's three fucking stories.
551.6,552.6, So you had your story.
552.6,553.6, So you had your story.
553.6,555.6," Coach Tim, that's where it's going to be like."
555.6,556.6," You know, that's the story."
556.6,557.6, I want to get that out of the story.
557.6,558.6, But I might do you want my autograph.
558.6,559.6, Okay.
559.6,561.6, That's a different story.
561.6,562.6, Fine.
562.6,563.6, All right.
563.6,565.6, You can tell it again if you are.
565.6,566.6," No, no, I'm done."
566.6,568.6, Talk about that Quake words.
568.6,572.6," However, I challenge you when you get to the end of your enemy territory Quake"
572.6,573.6, Wars story.
573.6,579.6, I want you to use the name of the game in the conclusion of your preview.
579.6,582.6," The thing that we've heard, we have a pet talk about today."
582.6,583.6, Okay.
583.6,584.6," By the way, like a clever pun."
584.6,586.6, It's clever pun on the name.
586.6,589.6," You know, like, I can't wait to invade that enemy territory."
589.6,590.6, Let's see.
590.6,591.6, That's not a clever.
591.6,592.6, You need a better way.
592.6,593.6, That's pretty good.
593.6,594.6, You can't wait to invade.
594.6,596.6, I don't want to make a very foundation of their advantage.
596.6,597.6, You're a bad volunteer.
597.6,598.6, Yeah.
598.6,599.6, You.
599.6,602.6," I like to invade her and be kind of like, you got it."
602.6,603.6, All right.
603.6,605.6, Now I'm going to have to spend the whole time thinking about it.
605.6,607.6, I can't even about how to wrap it up.
607.6,610.6, And I need you wrapping it up.
610.6,611.6," Uh, no."
611.6,614.6, Not going to be territory invading it.
614.6,615.6, You got to wrap it up.
615.6,617.6, You're going to invade that is.
617.6,619.6," No, I'm saying it."
619.6,621.6, I know what you're saying.
622.6,623.6, I still don't get it.
623.6,624.6, Wrap it up.
624.6,625.6, Follow your thing.
625.6,626.6, I get it.
626.6,627.6, I got it.
627.6,628.6, Okay.
628.6,629.6, So.
629.6,631.6, Quake Wars playing that bit.
631.6,633.6, I don't know what to say now.
633.6,635.6," No, I'm really liking it."
635.6,636.6, I'm playing like crazy.
636.6,640.6," The first thing when you fired up, though, is like to go into it with battlefield"
640.6,641.6, goggles on.
641.6,646.6," Which is interesting because when we're all playing battlefield, we spend half the time."
646.6,647.6," You know, we love it."
647.6,649.6, Bitching about all the little things that are messed up.
649.6,651.6," Oh, God, how long has dice been making games?"
651.6,653.6, How come they can't get the browser right?
653.6,657.6, How come this vehicle blows up if it hits a rock or something like that?
657.6,662.6," But then you go into Quake Wars and everyone's like immediately, oh, God, the vehicles"
662.6,667.6," handle like shit or this and that, you know, and basically what I'm getting from it,"
667.6,673.6, what I'm getting from the complaints that I heard first are basically it's not battlefield.
673.6,678.6," You know, or whatever the being, you can't go on like a 50 kilisperry just because you get your hands on."
678.6,680.6," You know, if you're not for something like that, you know."
680.6,684.6, Do you think that that it's a huge part of the beta crowd or BF players?
684.6,686.6, I think there's got to be.
686.6,690.6," I mean, if you like that type of game, you know, you're going to grab stance or reason you're"
690.6,691.6, going to be playing it.
691.6,696.6," I've really been waiting for it for the same reason that I, you know, I kind of got over the"
696.6,698.6, hill with BALSetsu after playing it.
698.6,699.6, I don't know.
699.6,701.6," I think I got to like, tell the like, 700 hours or something."
701.6,703.6, And then just start come back to recently.
703.6,707.6," It's like, I want that category of game with a fresh experience to be there."
707.6,710.6, So it's cool in that way.
710.6,716.6," But so even I was reacting that way at first, but again, this is like just the slightest, you know,"
716.6,717.6, complaint you can have.
717.6,721.6," Instead, it's curious though that like when you go in, you're not like, wow, here's a group"
721.6,726.6, that has one game that they were that has started as a mod and that they were commissioned by
726.6,732.6, into create and who like all mod makers just have this enormous story of ideas.
732.6,733.6, And they sound completely out there.
733.6,735.6, They sound revolutionary and all the stuff.
735.6,740.6, But then most of the time when one mod makers actually go and implement them and then the first versions
740.6,745.6," of their games come out, you're like, oh, okay, that's why like, you know, like they either whatever"
745.6,748.6, didn't try this kind of thing because it's a mess or something.
748.6,753.6, But all the stuff that they're promising with deployables and there are so many varieties of
753.6,759.6," deployables defensive and offensive countermeasure type deployables, even right"
759.6,760.6, on stuff like that.
760.6,764.6," It all works, you know, to give it the vibe of an RTS or something, that's happening at the same"
764.6,768.6, time that you're playing the shooting shooting banding makes up.
768.6,770.6, That stuff is totally working fine.
770.6,774.6," It works so well and there's all these things are like, okay, let's stop the acknowledge"
774.6,775.6, first what they're getting right.
775.6,779.6," But anyway, the more I play it, then I got to that point where, you know, you just hit that"
779.6,781.6, and I've always talked about this work.
781.6,784.6," Instead of rationalizing if the game's good or bad, you just trust your instinct for how much"
784.6,785.6, fun or you have it.
785.6,786.6," Yeah, sure."
786.6,790.6," And it was like, by the end of the second night, I was like, I want to stay, I should"
790.6,791.6, sucked it out.
791.6,795.6," If I stay up to three a moment, we're going to get over half hours of sleep or whatever,"
795.6,796.6, I just wanted to keep playing.
796.6,798.6," All weekend, I wanted to play it."
798.6,802.6," My cable's been spotty, so it sucks and every time it goes out, I feel like those old school"
802.6,806.6," feeds, you know, when I can ever quest server would go down, they sit there and they enter"
806.6,807.6," button all day, they'll be each other."
807.6,809.6," Like, oh, guys, they're still trying to get in."
809.6,812.6, So I felt like that and just completely loving it.
812.6,816.6, There's only one map I'm a baton now.
816.6,820.6," But in it already, the infantry stuff is so good, you know what I mean?"
820.6,825.6," So, you know, at first, here's another part of the phase of appreciating the game for what"
825.6,826.6, it is.
826.6,828.6," And like, okay, well, that'll get to the vehicles right."
828.6,831.6," Maybe this is going to be the equivalent, but it gets to infantry and really"
831.6,832.6, nails it.
832.6,834.6, Because that was apparent right off the bat.
834.6,836.6," And there's just, it works well enough."
836.6,841.6," You know, it's got the speed of, you know, like a day at a feed or something, not quite full"
841.6,842.6, plate for speed.
842.6,848.6," But, you know, running around shooting, the guns are pretty accurate and stuff, but you have"
848.6,852.6," a good chance to have all these rat fire fights mixed up with your bag of tricks, like, you know,"
852.6,857.6," tactical shields that you're throwing down, remote drones are awesome on the strong"
857.6,862.6," sides, basically, like a little electronic insect type thing with explosive charge."
862.6,866.6, And so it's great when whatever scenario you're at and you're finding a guy standing on a
866.6,869.6," hilltop looking through his binoculars, because he's about to call him in our tailory"
869.6,873.6," bomb and then you just take it right in front of him, blow it up in this face, you know, when"
873.6,876.6," he's also been, you know, you can not leave you vulnerable, right?"
876.6,877.6," Like, if you're controlling the vehicle."
877.6,881.6," So at that point, yeah, I would be sitting somewhere, like, doing the equivalent of looking"
881.6,886.6," through some kind of a site or looking into a viewfinder, so I could see through."
886.6,889.6, So I could see through the buzzer.
889.6,892.6, And then I have kill rog Jeff.
892.6,895.6," Yeah, I'll thank you."
895.6,896.6, Thanks for the advice.
896.6,897.6, There is.
897.6,898.6," Yeah, I have to do it."
898.6,899.6," It's like, yeah, now it makes sense."
899.6,901.6," Well, I'm pulling the whole wall off here."
901.6,902.6, I got to it.
902.6,904.6, So that stuff is really cool.
904.6,906.6, I'm completely loving the imagery.
906.6,908.6, It just has a lot to do it.
908.6,911.6," Well, first of all, I mean, go on with this."
911.6,917.6," And then, then I start liking the vehicles and stuff, just find with a few exceptions, you know,"
917.6,922.6," they do, they are kind of because there's not a smooth acceleration and deseleration."
922.6,925.6," There's just like all or nothing, you know, so it's like you get into a tank and suddenly"
925.6,927.6, you're going full speed.
927.6,932.6, There are jerky and also because instead of using vehicle pathing where the map is coded
932.6,938.6," with terrain that permits a vehicle to drive on it, it's basically just a vehicle, it's the terrain"
938.6,940.6, that's there and then physics.
940.6,944.6," It makes for, when you go boosting through a bunch of trees and over hills, it's a bumpy"
944.6,945.6," asphalt ride, you know."
945.6,947.6," I mean, the kind of ride that would make you puke in your life."
947.6,949.6, And it looks like that on the screen.
949.6,950.6, But I got used.
950.6,952.6," You know, I started getting used to that."
952.6,954.6, And that's fine trade out there.
954.6,955.6, I'd like it.
955.6,957.6, They missed with the tank stuff.
957.6,961.6," So you can slow down, you know, you can slow to a stop and gradually move, you know,"
961.6,965.6, or just even move by tapping with the WPs and that you can navigate slowly through
965.6,967.6, building stuff.
967.6,971.6, Other vehicles are some of them are really fun to strong hogs.
971.6,972.6, Yeah.
972.6,974.6," To them, too, geez."
974.6,975.6," No, it doesn't."
975.6,979.6," But that's like, so it's so shameful in the game because like everything is"
980.6,981.6, strong.
981.6,984.6," We're playing and that's basically, you know, so on that green."
984.6,985.6, Yeah.
985.6,986.6, Yeah.
986.6,989.6," So like that's, that's, that's strong take, you know, down to the opponents and convert them into"
989.6,992.6," strong, which serves as both ammunition and hell for them."
992.6,994.6, Awesome.
994.6,996.6," And it's, it's not a rocket."
996.6,997.6, It's a rocket.
997.6,999.6," Everything is actually like, yeah, one of those,"
999.6,1003.6," the bears really, they're named things to it."
1003.6,1008.6," So the hog has a turbo boost on it, which is cool, but it has like an energy"
1008.6,1012.6," knife, sort of, you know, real thing that when you, when you're boosting it,"
1012.6,1014.6, it appears on the front of the vehicle.
1014.6,1019.6," So you can just, it actually makes this cheap, useful against any class of vehicle"
1019.6,1021.6, if providing you hit a full speed.
1021.6,1025.6, So you get these red snares where you see a tank come down the road and traditionally
1025.6,1027.6," at a battlefield game, if you're in a humbete and you see a tank,"
1027.6,1030.6," T72 or something coming down the street, like whatever."
1030.6,1033.6," I'll try to be like, but everyone gets hit the hell out, run, hopefully,"
1033.6,1036.6," you know, and just wait first, double a whop."
1036.6,1039.6," So now you're like, okay, I'm going to jook a little bit."
1039.6,1044.6," And if he and boost and if he misses me, if I can hit him full on, you know,"
1044.6,1048.6," false pee, head on collision before he reloads, it shoots me again to blow me up."
1048.6,1050.6, I'll run right through him and just blow that thing down.
1050.6,1051.6, So energy knife compares through.
1051.6,1055.6," It just, yeah, you can, you can run up your full speed at a tank or a battle locker,"
1055.6,1058.6," you know, and it's kind of a hand break on it, which is red."
1058.6,1061.6," So, you know, maybe a bunch of guys across the grid and you're like,"
1061.6,1064.6," do it a side-wind or maneuver across the bridge while boosting, you know,"
1064.6,1067.6," tap in the handbrake so that you wag wag the vehicle around it, anyone."
1067.6,1071.6," If you missed, you just do a power slide 180 and come back across the bridge form."
1071.6,1073.6, It doesn't sound very realistic.
1073.6,1074.6," That's, you've struggled."
1074.6,1075.6, You've struggled.
1075.6,1076.6, You've struggled.
1076.6,1077.6," No, what point were you?"
1077.6,1078.6, We were talking.
1078.6,1081.6, This is why I would play this over like battlefield two.
1081.6,1082.6," I think that's strong, isn't it?"
1082.6,1083.6, Aliens.
1083.6,1088.6," Well, I mean, I don't know if it's slightly less realistic."
1088.6,1092.6," I don't know if it's like, I mean, battlefield say you're going however many miles an hour"
1092.6,1098.6, the jet hit the eject and then you land inside the turret of a tank and it's suddenly you're driving the tank.
1098.6,1100.6, And then you jump out.
1100.6,1101.6," I mean, it's happened."
1101.6,1105.6," You know, I'm excited for this game because it is not a battlefield game."
1105.6,1111.6," And I'm not saying that because of, because I was a huge fan of 1942, but to me battlefield"
1111.6,1117.6, is at the point that countershright got to be where the fans are so hardcore and they've been playing for so long now.
1117.6,1120.6, But I'm just intimidated to even join on.
1120.6,1122.6, It's like that one time you watch me play in battlefield.
1122.6,1123.6, Yeah.
1123.6,1125.6," You're just standing behind me going, I don't think you would have to."
1125.6,1126.6, You want to level playing for it?
1126.6,1129.6," Because fans, it games tend to be really freaking good."
1129.6,1133.6, But do you think they're going to be able to come into Quake Wars fresh with those skills?
1133.6,1136.6," You know, I've already seen people like bunny hop and stuff."
1136.6,1139.6," And so if you take a good rail gunner from Quake 4,"
1139.6,1142.6," yeah, throw him in here, give him the same rail gun."
1142.6,1146.6," It's, you know, we're so differently, but just, you know, no scoping and bunny hopping."
1146.6,1150.6," I was always under a jam campaign, well, I'd be able to do that."
1150.6,1155.6," You know, you know, not really because you can do variations of it."
1155.6,1156.6, Of course.
1156.6,1158.6, That's how I'm responding inside of you.
1158.6,1159.6, You can't do that.
1159.6,1161.6, There's a towel for get it then.
1161.6,1168.6, So something else that's interesting about the game is that it's an anti battlefield in many ways
1168.6,1175.6," and that they're taking, it's clear that they've made very close attention to things that they felt didn't work so well in battlefield"
1175.6,1177.6, and they want to address that and find solutions for it.
1177.6,1181.6," One of those is that with the capture point, the free capture point system of battlefield,"
1181.6,1186.6," you tend to unevenly distribute the action, the fire fights all across the map."
1186.6,1189.6," And at any given moment, people can be doing like the dumbest thing possible."
1189.6,1190.6, Yeah.
1190.6,1196.6," And a well known example of Balfield's map called, well, so well known that I forgot the name of it."
1196.6,1197.6," Oh, no."
1197.6,1199.6, It's just a sharp guy.
1199.6,1203.6, It's a try to think of a sharp opponent's or less what it's called.
1203.6,1206.6, And there's a TV station that the Marine spawn at.
1206.6,1207.6, That's that's their main thing.
1207.6,1208.6, Okay.
1208.6,1209.6, And there's helicopter thing there.
1209.6,1211.6," And it's worth more points than everything else, right?"
1211.6,1216.6," And you should always, if you're that team because you have no uncapturable spawn."
1216.6,1219.6," So if you lose that, you're going to have to fight you to back and you can get pushed out."
1219.6,1222.6, But idiots are always at any random place they can think of.
1222.6,1225.6, They see that it's being cat the TV station to be captured.
1225.6,1227.6, That hotel where they don't care.
1227.6,1230.6," It's just, you know, so you have all this or where you're running around the map."
1230.6,1232.6," You're like, it's been like 10 minutes since I seen someone."
1232.6,1235.6," And then the next thing you see it was like in a tag helicopter, helicopter, helicopter, helicopter."
1235.6,1239.6," Yeah, and chapter that's been,"
1239.6,1244.6, Tipped off to your location by their commander and age comes in like hits you with a 30 millimeter
1244.6,1245.6, bull or something.
1245.6,1250.6, But so here what they said is let's make sure everyone is at least with in a reason.
1250.6,1253.6, Fighting for a specific territory.
1253.6,1257.6, And then we'll just move from there onto the next one and onto the next one.
1257.6,1265.6, Very much like the way our territory works in the way that some of the maps work in the board just like dustball.
1265.6,1270.6," And that is, I find this cool because there's already this, it's just much more tense."
1270.6,1272.6, But they still allow room for it.
1272.6,1277.6, So it's not each team throwing every asset they have at the same point.
1277.6,1286.6," They distribute if I say, okay, well, if you're the strong and say you're defending this site where the humans want to build a giant EMP"
1286.6,1290.6, to structure that's going to take down your base and shield and let them in for the next phase.
1290.6,1294.6," You're going to want to put up anti-personal territory, anti-vehicle territory stuff."
1294.6,1296.6, And that's going to give you an advantage.
1296.6,1299.6, The humans can't build that stuff there until they capture.
1299.6,1302.6," However, they are sending in big artillery stuff that they're making."
1302.6,1309.6," And then you're like, okay, if you're strong, we need to put up a laser barrier that's going to shoot these missiles out of the sky as they come into get us."
1309.6,1312.6," And so they say, oh, they got a laser barrier, we need to get in and hack that."
1312.6,1318.6," So even in the course of that example right there, you've suddenly created all these new objectives."
1318.6,1324.6," So now, not only do you need to make the EMP thing, you need to destroy their shield so that you can get to your fire support."
1324.6,1330.6, You might want to just go up on the hill and the tank on the side and then just spam shells down into the hot zone.
1330.6,1334.6," I mean, I remember when they demo this game, I guess it's two E3s ago."
1334.6,1338.6," Yeah, it was so much fun every individual objective was."
1338.6,1341.6," Right, that it wasn't like a free for all."
1341.6,1353.6," It wasn't a capture point thing like that battlefield, but there was still a very sort of manic and in-francic team based attempt to solve these problems and get onto the next thing."
1353.6,1356.6," Yeah, and there was a lot to do other than their shoot people that were super fun."
1356.6,1361.6," And they still, yeah, there's a lot to do and there still have like auxiliary spark points so that you can."
1361.6,1364.6," One that can be captured, recaptured and that's there."
1364.6,1368.6," You don't have to have it, but it helps it saves you the time to get to the front line when it's there."
1368.6,1371.6, So that becomes like another secondary objective.
1371.6,1377.6," There are tertiary things where you're like, okay, say we need to get into some sewers and we can blow a one door off."
1377.6,1380.6, Maybe there's another or another door and then there are multiple ways.
1380.6,1386.6," And eventually as you, you know, you can choose to open one and just rush for the final objective or open them all so that therefore,"
1386.6,1390.6," you can use them to do something else or spread the area more ways in more access, you know."
1390.6,1392.6, All that works really well.
1392.6,1395.6, I played more maps than the one called see where it's available on the batas.
1395.6,1399.6, So I know like that it works that way in every case.
1399.6,1403.6," But it also gives you a chance for proof of writing within a single map, you know."
1403.6,1411.6," So you may start off in the Arctic and then you end up inside like, you know, a lush biodeon, low cancer greenery and stuff."
1411.6,1412.6, Keep going. Keep going.
1412.6,1414.6, I'm just going to see what you're doing.
1414.6,1416.6, I wrapped that shit up.
1416.6,1418.6," No, no."
1420.6,1422.6," No, no, no."
1422.6,1424.6," Sorry, I'm not a stuff said, yay."
1424.6,1425.6, Okay.
1425.6,1426.6, I scoped the barrio of his list.
1426.6,1428.6, So I should do not be talking about this.
1428.6,1430.6," Okay, I'm glad we."
1430.6,1431.6," So no, that's not it."
1431.6,1432.6, I'm not there after.
1432.6,1434.6," Yeah, I'm just doing it."
1434.6,1436.6," So some of the other maps, I mean, I previewed him."
1436.6,1437.6, I talked about him a long time ago.
1437.6,1439.6, They've been in our interration before.
1439.6,1448.6," I'm really hoping, you know, the canons and awesome map that takes place in the equivalent of the grand canyon and it ends up inside like the small canning tunnels."
1448.6,1451.6," So before we move on, I'm thinking what else I need to say."
1451.6,1454.6," There's, there's some issues that need to be worked out clearly."
1454.6,1459.6," This is a beta, a true beta in the sense that beta has always been."
1459.6,1462.6, But another thing is that people having just come off of.
1462.6,1466.6, Beta is in a demos and beta is clothing like halo and stuff or personally.
1467.6,1471.6," Well, this doesn't work or does the vehicle shoots the machine gun and the laser when I shoot."
1471.6,1472.6, And so it's beta.
1472.6,1473.6," Well, it's a beta."
1473.6,1477.6," And then the other thing that's that's annoying for me too, you know, because I want to champion."
1477.6,1480.6," Well, at the point now, just based on the amount of fun I'm having,"
1480.6,1485.6," I do want to proselytize for it because it's like, I think straight up, this is an odd."
1485.6,1486.6, There's so much potential in this game.
1486.6,1488.6, I love playing it after we're done with this.
1488.6,1491.6, We go fish diving and go play sports tonight.
1492.6,1496.6," You know, there's stuff that that beta will have and it's not just like, well,"
1496.6,1499.6, they've been working on this for years and they haven't fixed that.
1499.6,1504.6," But oftentimes when they when they iterate and they just, you know, one little change of code can have an inverse side effects and we're"
1504.6,1507.6, else going to reintroduce stuff that they already have for example.
1507.6,1508.6, That just happens.
1508.6,1512.6, That's how or so don't hit for each because there's no way active vision in this flash danger.
1512.6,1517.6," It really is game so that your rate of fire is, you know, with the, what is it?"
1517.6,1521.6, The acturized last raiders going to be randomly switching between single shot first.
1521.6,1523.6," You know, they will fix that stuff."
1523.6,1527.6," So instead, be helpful with the beta and think about the real issues, you know, like,"
1527.6,1530.6," as the torment or the strong aircraft is it useful enough, right?"
1530.6,1533.6," I think like personally, I think it flies well, but I don't think it doesn't"
1533.6,1537.6," have damage to justify the effort of going and getting in it, you know,"
1537.6,1540.6, and it's relatively easy to shoot down.
1540.6,1544.6," Now I understand that they unlike battlefield, they want to make a game with vehicles,"
1544.6,1546.6, but not a game about vehicles.
1546.6,1551.6," And the trick is, I don't think they're danger of that thing being a point monster"
1551.6,1555.6," because like I said, there's so many ways it's slow enough to hit a tank shells."
1555.6,1560.6," And another interesting thing in this game is like, any small arms fire will kill a pilot of any vehicle."
1560.6,1563.6," You can shoot a tank and if enough of your shooting a tank machine guns,"
1563.6,1567.6, it just attributes a certain percentage of that hit to the driver.
1567.6,1570.6," And you want to say, okay, so you avoid the whole problem of like,"
1570.6,1573.6," oh, I'm not, I don't have a rocket, so I can't take that thing out."
1573.6,1577.6," But the thing's super easy to kill, so you might as well make it a little more powerful."
1577.6,1579.6, That goes for a few things.
1579.6,1583.6," There's issues with the strong tank, there's issues with the GDF Humphee."
1583.6,1588.6, I think it would be cool if they made it so engineers can change the weapon load out on top.
1588.6,1590.6," So instead of like the wheat turrets on there now,"
1590.6,1594.6," if you're an engineer with upgrades, maybe you could put grenade launchers on there,"
1594.6,1596.6," you know, missile and stuff like that."
1596.6,1601.6," But all in all, I mean, play it and it's such a different game than Battlefield."
1601.6,1605.6," I really recommend giving it that chance and then when your World War Enforms talk about stuff,"
1605.6,1607.6," and stuff, and stuff, and stuff, and stuff, just say, like, you know,"
1607.6,1611.6," spin it some time bitching about how a frame of animation is missing, you know,"
1611.6,1615.6," between when you put your thumb on the Gatling button and when you take it off,"
1615.6,1620.6," I mean, let's focus our energies as people who want this game to be great on stuff that's going to be helpful"
1620.6,1623.6," that they can, however you're talking about message board posters."
1623.6,1624.6," Yeah, yeah, exactly."
1624.6,1626.6," I'm talking about message board posters, not us."
1626.6,1630.6," No, but I mean, it's going to be negative because that's what people do."
1630.6,1631.6," Okay, sure."
1631.6,1632.6, Yeah.
1632.6,1634.6," Well, I was thinking for a minute, you're like, because that's another thing."
1634.6,1640.6," It's not my job to make this a good game, but I'm saying this as a player and to my fellow message board."
1640.6,1648.6, That was a guy on our message board who was mentioned about the performance of SimCity societies.
1648.6,1651.6, On the one-up show video.
1651.6,1652.6, Right.
1652.6,1655.6," And at the very beginning of the gameplay video, it says,"
1655.6,1665.6," This is pretty alpha, the game will not be running, you know, with something and has a flat out the sclimmer of the performance."
1665.6,1671.6," And this guy was bitching anyway saying, yeah, but then they shouldn't have put it out there because now I don't trust."
1671.6,1676.6," You know, they just shouldn't, if they want to make our game look good, then they shouldn't go back to the whole thing."
1676.6,1677.6, That is direct.
1677.6,1678.6," Yeah, that got referenced."
1678.6,1681.6," Yeah, I don't want to drag that up again."
1682.6,1684.6, But you're going to go study with the scam shop.
1684.6,1689.6," Yeah, you said the scam shop is the way it is now, even with the Jake."
1689.6,1693.6, I could tell I would still go study with the new of a crowd.
1693.6,1694.6, Yeah.
1694.6,1697.6, You want me to give you that tag line and propose before.
1697.6,1698.6, Yes.
1698.6,1699.6," No, you don't."
1699.6,1701.6," Oh, wait, no, not surprise me, dude."
1701.6,1704.6," No, no, no, god, no, you can't say that on here."
1704.6,1707.6, He had a nasty thing.
1707.6,1709.6, The gift of your radio motto.
1709.6,1710.6," Yeah, no."
1710.6,1712.6," I thought, did you come up with your closer?"
1712.6,1714.6, Did I ask for a new or previous?
1714.6,1715.6," No, I did."
1715.6,1717.6, You're going to tell me something about the quakes.
1717.6,1719.6, You're the big one shakes up.
1719.6,1721.6, Battlefield 2 should be a quaking in its boots.
1721.6,1722.6, There you go.
1722.6,1723.6, Yeah.
1723.6,1725.6, Come this fall.
1725.6,1726.6, Come this fall.
1726.6,1727.6, Yeah.
1727.6,1728.6, Battlefield 2.
1728.6,1730.6, I feel it's my duty to heat this call.
1730.6,1731.6," Yeah, just so."
1731.6,1735.6," So I know, but he thinks we're accuses of in jokes here."
1735.6,1738.6," What we're talking about is, uh, is our current today's pet peeve."
1738.6,1746.6, But this game previews at end was some like fucking stupid ass pun on the name of the game
1746.6,1749.6, as if that's something actually like clever.
1749.6,1750.6, Yeah.
1750.6,1753.6, So watch your watch your local game magazines.
1753.6,1754.6, Watch for that.
1754.6,1757.6, Watch for when they put the name of the game in the end of the preview.
1757.6,1759.6," You know, and websites."
1759.6,1760.6, And websites.
1760.6,1761.6, Yeah.
1761.6,1762.6, Everywhere.
1762.6,1763.6, Yeah.
1763.6,1764.6, Watch out.
1764.6,1766.6," Like I was doing for Sim City Society, right?"
1766.6,1769.6, And that was so people know what we're talking about.
1769.6,1774.6, I can't wait to join that society when this game shifts this fall.
1774.6,1775.6, So what's up?
1775.6,1776.6, That's a bad.
1776.6,1777.6, That's a bad one.
1777.6,1778.6, That's a bad one.
1778.6,1780.6, You can do this for any.
1780.6,1781.6, Yeah.
1781.6,1782.6, Yeah.
1782.6,1783.6, We'll stop right there.
1783.6,1784.6, That we're so close.
1784.6,1787.6," We always want to go in a tangent or we're just like,"
1787.6,1791.6," do our beef with like that industry trans, but we take it into a"
1791.6,1792.6, perfect.
1792.6,1793.6, Yeah.
1793.6,1794.6, But the other thing.
1795.6,1797.6," We need to just in general, if we think we're better."
1797.6,1798.6," No, we are."
1798.6,1802.6," If we didn't, if we weren't always so eager, we'd be able to just for like,"
1802.6,1805.6," to say that we were the first to do this or the first to see that, you know?"
1805.6,1806.6, Yeah.
1806.6,1810.6," And that's the reason being is because it's kind of like,"
1810.6,1811.6, conceiting that.
1811.6,1816.6," Well, our job is basically to ride the unit."
1816.6,1818.6, So.
1818.6,1820.6, So ride the unit.
1820.6,1823.6, So publishers and developers and yarn whatever.
1823.6,1824.6, So they say unit.
1824.6,1825.6, Yeah.
1825.6,1827.6, I'm using diffuse lighters here.
1827.6,1831.6," So to ride the units of the, and you're saying, well, of course,"
1831.6,1832.6, that's what we do.
1832.6,1835.6," And so the only gauge of excellence is if we were the first to, if we got"
1835.6,1837.6, sloppy seconds.
1837.6,1841.6," You know, it's like, so that, that, that, that, that, that, this is part of the,"
1841.6,1846.6," uh, basically grade school level, we're still operating in this industry."
1846.6,1849.6, You do not see in movie magazines.
1849.6,1852.6," When they're doing like when they're on set going to see whatever,"
1852.6,1855.6," the new, yeah, score sazy movie."
1855.6,1858.6," I was the first person on the set to get to talk to Martin Scores,"
1858.6,1859.6, that's a easy.
1859.6,1860.6, That should go to any form news.
1860.6,1861.6, I'm right.
1861.6,1862.6, I'm not your right.
1862.6,1863.6, You're right.
1863.6,1865.6," Except for herinals, right, who from 10 to 10."
1865.6,1867.6, But it's not the end of it.
1867.6,1869.6, We have not let it that level of the score.
1869.6,1872.6," We're not saying this out of any kind, like, I swear to you,"
1872.6,1875.6," I can, like, assure you, this is nothing to do with like,"
1875.6,1879.6, we're jealous that we didn't get whatever that we were at the first one.
1879.6,1884.6," It's like, I think it's legitimately detrimental and a black eye for what we do."
1884.6,1886.6," It makes it look like, like, completely new."
1886.6,1890.6, It makes us look like we get the same excuses at our magazine.
1890.6,1891.6, We're happy when we get them.
1891.6,1895.6, And we get our audience knows when something's fucking new.
1895.6,1897.6, They're on the messageports all the time.
1897.6,1900.6," It's like, if something's new, it's like, oh, hold this."
1900.6,1903.6," The whole thing is like, making this story, I've heard about this."
1903.6,1906.6, I wonder if it's exactly that they didn't spend 300 words telling me.
1906.6,1908.6, Instead of 300 words about how you got the story.
1908.6,1910.6, That's the thing that bothers me.
1910.6,1911.6, The story should not be about you.
1911.6,1914.6," It should be about the game, the thing."
1914.6,1916.6," Yes, we know you got it."
1916.6,1917.6, We're reading the fucking article.
1917.6,1918.6, Sure.
1918.6,1919.6, Okay.
1919.6,1920.6, Yeah.
1920.6,1922.6," You got to interview with like, Jenny, shallige or something, you know."
1922.6,1923.6, Yeah.
1923.6,1924.6, For you.
1924.6,1925.6, If Mr. Loretta looks like this.
1925.6,1929.6," I swear, if I see that shit, I just, like, red line that we try to get it out."
1929.6,1932.6," You know, you could say it once, maybe."
1932.6,1934.6," Oh, I'd say."
1934.6,1935.6, On the cover out.
1935.6,1936.6, Yeah.
1936.6,1939.6," You know, you're, makes a, which is basically just a marketing tool."
1939.6,1940.6, Yeah.
1940.6,1943.6," If you bought the thing, you got, you've already paid, you know."
1943.6,1952.6," And you can, people could tell you don't need to be, if the, if the, if the exclusive, if something's going to be a value to the reader, there are any appreciative of it by the fact that they, that it's there."
1952.6,1953.6, Don't know.
1953.6,1954.6, Yeah.
1954.6,1955.6, Yeah.
1955.6,1960.6," Then the greater high-larity now, too, with the magazines and said, usually most of the shit is we've done them in the internet."
1960.6,1961.6," Oh, yeah."
1961.6,1962.6," Oh, yeah."
1962.6,1963.6, You got it first.
1963.6,1964.6, Yeah.
1964.6,1967.6, And the reason why we're spending the week is the same amount of energy.
1967.6,1973.6, We're spending the same amount of energy trying to write the best stories rather than the first stories of everything here here.
1973.6,1974.6, We would be somewhere.
1974.6,1975.6, Amen.
1975.6,1976.6, Yeah.
1976.6,1977.6, Okay.
1977.6,1978.6," Also, end of rent."
1978.6,1979.6, No.
1979.6,1980.6," And now, rent continues."
1980.6,1982.6," Well, I'm just going to say, you know, we know we're not perfect either."
1982.6,1983.6," No, totally make mistakes."
1983.6,1985.6, We're constantly trying to correct that course of that.
1985.6,1989.6, But that's just one of the sort of bad habits in this industry that need to go away.
1989.6,1990.6, True.
1990.6,1997.6," And the biggest thing that happens, ranting on podcasts about random asset is a good one."
1997.6,2003.6," I, I, I, I, I, I'd Geoff, you wanted that we wanted to talk about, uh, what brain games."
2003.6,2006.6," Oh, oh, my God, what look at the timer ready?"
2006.6,2007.6," Oh, shit."
2007.6,2008.6, I took a break.
2008.6,2011.6," Yeah, we're going to take a break and we'll come back and we'll rent some more for you."
2011.6,2012.6, Yeah.
2012.6,2015.6, This one up podcast is brought to you by Games for Windows.
2015.6,2017.6, Welcome to Better PC Gaming.
2017.6,2021.6," Created with the idea that gaming should deliver more games for Windows branded titles,"
2021.6,2025.6, Bring you all the fun of gaming without all the work and with the hottest titles around
2025.6,2032.6, And Windows Vista compatibility games for Windows promises to deliver great new gaming experiences every time you play.
2032.6,2037.6," Uh, so we have, uh, we have what's our next run?"
2037.6,2040.6, We were ranting on with each other on English.
2040.6,2043.6," Yeah, we wanted to do their bitch and about, uh, well, because what's the announcement?"
2043.6,2045.6, This whole thing came from the announcement.
2045.6,2048.6, It's basically the phernology genre of games.
2048.6,2056.6," Uh, games that, uh, whatever, they, they say that they will make your brain either heavier, younger,"
2056.6,2059.6," or agile, whatever the, whatever the case might be."
2059.6,2061.6," And that's, that's the, that's the each game."
2061.6,2062.6, So bring it up.
2062.6,2063.6, We'll see you today.
2063.6,2064.6, They've got to be.
2064.6,2065.6, Thanks for having me.
2065.6,2066.6, Thanks for having me.
2066.6,2067.6, Right. So those are news item today.
2067.6,2071.6," I think on next gen site, um, that Nicole Kidman has been picked as the, uh,"
2071.6,2075.6, he was going to be the face of the brain brain age games for the BS.
2075.6,2079.6," Oh, and there was a quote like from the marketing director, right?"
2079.6,2083.6," You know, that was like, uh, you know, we think your opinions are going to be really excited."
2083.6,2087.6," The learn of this, the Nicole Kidman was the face of the brain."
2087.6,2088.6, Okay.
2088.6,2094.6," So it just lasted this run where, you know, I was like, I'm like, it all the coverage for, for that game."
2094.6,2097.6," When it, when it first came out, and you know, it was a fun game."
2097.6,2099.6, Totally. It's a good game.
2099.6,2100.6, It's fun.
2100.6,2101.6, Yeah. It's fun.
2101.6,2105.6," But in all the coverage, everyone's just eating up this, like, there's a doctor."
2105.6,2107.6, And he helped make this game.
2107.6,2110.6, His name is it. There's a guy with a PhD in front of his name.
2110.6,2111.6, And he's in this game.
2111.6,2116.6," And that was point out to Jeff, you know, how suddenly we're, uh, we're pretty"
2116.6,2121.6," discerning in the way that we apply, you know, our thinking when, when people are trying to leverage science."
2121.6,2127.6," You know, what gets us or something when someone says, oh, we've scientifically proven that gaming makes you a homicidal maniac."
2127.6,2132.6," And you immediately and rightfully so go and say, well, well, okay, it's up to this very, very bad science."
2132.6,2137.6," But then someone starts throwing some ratchet sites our way, but says it's beneficial to us."
2137.6,2140.6," We like, you know, this is it."
2140.6,2142.6, Gaming's making your shit smarter.
2142.6,2144.6, Gaming's making your brain fucking bigger.
2144.6,2145.6, Gaming's making it great.
2145.6,2146.6, Younger.
2146.6,2148.6," They were like, yeah, I'm right out of that."
2148.6,2150.6, An actual doctor helped make this game.
2150.6,2151.6, Yeah.
2151.6,2152.6, But so who's that doctor?
2152.6,2153.6," Yeah, exactly."
2153.6,2156.6," Well, part of the planning to believe it because like, first time I fired a brain age,"
2156.6,2159.6, and it told me of a stimulating my free frontal cortex.
2159.6,2161.6," And it showed me a picture of my, you know,"
2161.6,2163.6, pre frontal cortex being stimulated.
2163.6,2164.6, I was ready to believe him.
2164.6,2167.6," Like, Dan, when you're a brain age, when you're brain age,"
2167.6,2168.6, I get younger.
2168.6,2169.6, Did you feel so?
2169.6,2171.6, I was dropped 60 years in a day.
2171.6,2174.6," See, and I probably thought about yourself."
2174.6,2175.6, Didn't you?
2175.6,2176.6, A little bit.
2176.6,2178.6, This game has exercise my brain.
2178.6,2183.6," And there's some like, pain head out there who the DS told him that his brain was like 80"
2184.6,2185.6, pounds.
2185.6,2189.6," As if like, I don't even know if pre frontal cortex stimulation is a better bad thing."
2189.6,2191.6," So you just like, oh, it is."
2191.6,2193.6, I went 340 to 380 this week.
2193.6,2194.6, It's just my brain though.
2194.6,2195.6, That's all good.
2195.6,2196.6, Yeah.
2196.6,2197.6, I'll just keep that.
2197.6,2200.6, That's all I see today to my brain weight.
2200.6,2204.6," So I, so I guess, Sean, you googled this doctor, right?"
2204.6,2206.6," Oh, well, I just wanted to look, you know, I'm like, okay,"
2206.6,2207.6, who is this guy?
2207.6,2209.6," Let's look because, you know, as we know,"
2209.6,2212.6, throwing the credentials in front of something is off to Dodd's
2212.6,2215.6," media and this guy, of course, was known beforehand."
2215.6,2219.6," The only thing, you know, you get when you, when you go to his name is that he"
2219.6,2223.6, was arguing that games were detrimental to people's cognitive health.
2223.6,2227.6," Prior to his signing up with Nintendo for his approval, you know,"
2227.6,2230.6, what I'm assuming is a lucrative view.
2230.6,2233.6," But, you know, when you put his name in with other neuroscientists,"
2233.6,2236.6," another, you know, researchers on cognition and stuff, Stephen Baker,"
2236.6,2240.6," you know, some of the programs at MIT, and, you know, any of the different people."
2241.6,2244.6," You don't find anything. You, every hit on this guy is about this game."
2244.6,2250.6," So maybe he is, but I can't, the fact that he's willing to put his name on and tell"
2250.6,2253.6," people that, yeah, your brain is actually getting younger because you're doing"
2253.6,2256.6," so because you're basically doing like the equivalent of highlights,"
2256.6,2259.6," you know, of feeling in like the interactive parts and highlights magazine"
2259.6,2262.6," and the dentist office, like that throws that guy into the"
2262.6,2268.6," crack department. So, so what else did I have to say about that guy?"
2268.6,2272.6," That was pretty much it. Just like I'd like to see, you know,"
2272.6,2276.6," while I was throwing out the analogy to you that, that,"
2276.6,2279.6," saying that this guy was a doctor and having, you know,"
2279.6,2284.6," bringing this guy, toting this guy out is like, you know, proof that your brain is getting bigger."
2284.6,2287.6, That's kind of like the doctors who worked for the tobacco company.
2287.6,2291.6," You know, it's a command and prove that smoking is the right for you."
2291.6,2292.6, It's not that serious.
2292.6,2297.6," Well, I doctors say that, you know, a pound of nicotine in your lungs is actually a good thing."
2297.6,2299.6," All right, that healthy coatings."
2299.6,2302.6, I believe you're an intended doctor.
2302.6,2304.6," Dr. Mario, why does it want to be?"
2304.6,2306.6, Dr. Mario.
2306.6,2309.6," Anyway, it's a, it's, it's great for Nicole Kidman."
2309.6,2311.6," Wait, wait, what does she have to do with this?"
2311.6,2313.6, Is she now a doctor? What's going on?
2313.6,2317.6, She just plays it and she plays it and she's a movie star.
2317.6,2319.6," So therefore, you should play it."
2319.6,2322.6, It's because our famous movie stars play this and their brains are getting.
2322.6,2325.6, Is her like virtual head going to be in the game talking to you?
2325.6,2326.6, Give a new man.
2326.6,2327.6, Mathematics and so try.
2327.6,2331.6, What would be great is that for actually starting renting before we rent that far into your life?
2331.6,2333.6," Yeah, we were already refing on it."
2333.6,2335.6, Maybe your actual real head starts getting bigger.
2335.6,2336.6, Right.
2336.6,2340.6," Then we're going to have this like, frequently called him and then he's going to head out there."
2340.6,2342.6, That's seven times six.
2342.6,2344.6, 13.
2344.6,2346.6, So what do you have?
2346.6,2350.6, What else do you guys plan to do with that a border?
2350.6,2352.6, It's not something like nice transition.
2352.6,2354.6," You're like, what do you want to do?"
2354.6,2356.6, Second way in the year.
2356.6,2358.6, How about that weather?
2358.6,2360.6, That was science right there.
2360.6,2362.6," Ryan, you're playing something again, aren't you?"
2362.6,2363.6, I don't know.
2363.6,2364.6, It's not the usual.
2364.6,2368.6," Well, I played a couple things over the weekend."
2369.6,2374.6," One of the things I've been doing, I just did our hotlist page for the magazine, which you're on."
2374.6,2376.6, Tell the listeners what that is.
2376.6,2384.6," We basically, we recommend five games each month to the route and have been out in our door to work playing."
2384.6,2386.6, You haven't happened to miss them.
2386.6,2388.6, That sounds great.
2388.6,2390.6, Where can I get that?
2390.6,2392.6, Did you have to do it?
2392.6,2394.6, Jeff W. Magazine.
2394.6,2395.6, I'm trying to do it.
2395.6,2396.6, Sponfini is commercial with me.
2396.6,2398.6, It's not having it.
2398.6,2400.6, And yeah.
2400.6,2402.6, I'm going to prepare together with some people in here.
2402.6,2406.6, One of the games that I put in the issue that we're shipping now is pick it the right.
2406.6,2408.6, I guess.
2408.6,2410.6, Fine.
2410.6,2414.6, I think we talked about that in about 10 to 4 weeks.
2414.6,2416.6, And it's not so good.
2416.6,2418.6, Or again conversion.
2418.6,2420.6, Like it's cut on.
2420.6,2422.6," And this week, Arcosone."
2422.6,2424.6, You can know what that is.
2424.6,2426.6, That name.
2426.6,2428.6, Carcasson.
2428.6,2430.6, Carcasson.
2430.6,2432.6," Yes, I do."
2432.6,2434.6, Condition.
2434.6,2436.6, Is that carcasson?
2436.6,2438.6, I can't stay with you tonight.
2438.6,2442.6, Or I tell you for underwear or something.
2442.6,2444.6, It's Italian for fun.
2444.6,2448.6, All right.
2448.6,2450.6, And take a ride.
2450.6,2452.6, Take a ride.
2452.6,2454.6, You're playing the ball.
2454.6,2456.6, I'm playing the TV.
2456.6,2458.6, Yeah.
2458.6,2460.6, Are you doing?
2460.6,2462.6, There's some really good people online.
2462.6,2464.6, Part of you playing too.
2464.6,2466.6, Oh yeah.
2466.6,2468.6, It's a very good game.
2468.6,2470.6, Yeah.
2470.6,2472.6, It's a very popular.
2472.6,2474.6, I'm a huge game.
2474.6,2476.6, Or game.
2476.6,2478.6, It's probably the one that you get.
2478.6,2480.6, Wineers and cheaters online.
2480.6,2481.6, But kind of weird.
2481.6,2483.6, Is it a startup conversion of the board game?
2483.6,2484.6, Yeah.
2484.6,2488.6, It's exactly an animated train instead of the little pieces.
2488.6,2491.6, They get people whining when you do things like actually you're in the strategy.
2491.6,2494.6," When you block, when you block, you're in the same way."
2494.6,2495.6, Yeah.
2495.6,2496.6, You don't mind.
2496.6,2499.6, And normally can't play board games on that computer.
2499.6,2502.6," Like, that I haven't really tried too many of them."
2502.6,2503.6," Like, not believe."
2503.6,2504.6, Or whatever.
2504.6,2505.6, I can play that company.
2505.6,2507.6," But like, it's a terrible game."
2507.6,2510.6," Well, is there, there must be a time limit on each turn."
2510.6,2511.6, Oh.
2511.6,2512.6, No.
2512.6,2513.6, That's one of the big problems I have.
2513.6,2515.6, Or you know the character.
2515.6,2519.6," Well, like, the trick has to go take a shit or something."
2519.6,2520.6, Yeah.
2520.6,2521.6," Yeah, you can."
2521.6,2522.6, The actor.
2522.6,2525.6, Eventually the game will grow them out though.
2525.6,2526.6, Yeah.
2526.6,2527.6, And then a bot takes it to the place.
2527.6,2528.6, Pretty much.
2528.6,2529.6, Yeah.
2529.6,2530.6, So it's not that great.
2530.6,2533.6, Pretty much any turn based strategy game that didn't have simultaneous move that could
2533.6,2534.6, not stand.
2534.6,2536.6," Like, here I was in my metrics and the earlier ones that don't have to fix that later."
2536.6,2537.6, Yeah.
2537.6,2540.6," You're just sitting there and just like, you know, I got a form of people play for."
2540.6,2541.6, Not fun.
2541.6,2546.6," Well, because it's like, you know, frustrated to get when you're friend and so when you like takes too long to make your move."
2546.6,2548.6, I did some asshole you don't know.
2548.6,2549.6, And they're for don't like.
2549.6,2550.6, Yeah.
2550.6,2554.6," Well, you know, they when you join you take it through I games that we see alike."
2554.6,2558.6," You know, past game only piece, you know, things are called like that."
2558.6,2559.6," Of course, that's a big goal."
2559.6,2561.6, Not so many temptation to move their own.
2561.6,2563.6, They go take it to ride.
2563.6,2565.6, That's a temptation to go in their dream.
2566.6,2568.6, I used to nearly had all the play mix.
2568.6,2569.6, Take it to ride.
2569.6,2570.6, Great.
2570.6,2571.6, We had the man.
2571.6,2575.6," And artsy essence, I have like the ongoing tradition of the big fun games."
2575.6,2578.6, I just call it like big fun and then like we make God.
2578.6,2580.6," Mine would be like, Opea in the my friends."
2580.6,2582.6, My friends name is Tremendo.
2582.6,2583.6, Yeah.
2583.6,2585.6, Yeah.
2585.6,2586.6, Yeah.
2586.6,2588.6," You know, making those people like that."
2588.6,2589.6, Every game.
2589.6,2590.6, Every game.
2590.6,2593.6," Like you're probably like, you know, it always ends up like baby."
2593.6,2596.6," Baby, baby, W talks to suck, but also no, we had no."
2596.6,2599.6, We had like the turgid fun series.
2599.6,2601.6, It's just that's not making you laugh.
2601.6,2602.6, Fuck you.
2602.6,2603.6, It's fine.
2603.6,2605.6," It's like, we're going to get a dictionary then."
2605.6,2607.6, I was still stuck on the beach.
2607.6,2609.6, I wanted to steal that.
2609.6,2613.6," But those are always the games that we would run like, like in company here is the big"
2613.6,2614.6, fun series games.
2614.6,2617.6, We'd always it was funny because we'd give by the very name of the game.
2617.6,2621.6, We'd give away our tactic to someone if someone was had played us before.
2621.6,2626.6," And before they patched it, you know, during one of the patch phases you could run."
2626.6,2627.6, I don't know.
2627.6,2633.6," With about 85% success rate, like a game where you can completely wipe out the access by getting,"
2633.6,2638.6," off half tracks, into their back base that had guns on them."
2638.6,2641.6," And before they had any AT stuff up, you know."
2641.6,2642.6, And you had the time to write.
2642.6,2648.6," You had to just go, all, I mean, you had to basically put your entire strategy into building these and getting them over in their back base as soon as you could."
2648.6,2651.6," But then like the whole time you, you know, ask of are you having big fun?"
2651.6,2652.6, How big is the fun?
2652.6,2653.6, How big is the fun you had?
2653.6,2654.6, That's so weird.
2654.6,2655.6, It's pretty big.
2657.6,2658.6, All right.
2658.6,2659.6, Now when else are you playing on?
2659.6,2660.6, You're playing one of the things.
2660.6,2663.6, I'm back up north of the rings on mine.
2663.6,2664.6, Yeah.
2664.6,2666.6, Which is what?
2666.6,2667.6, I'm not sure.
2667.6,2668.6, Yeah.
2668.6,2669.6, Are you still liking it?
2669.6,2670.6, Still fun.
2670.6,2671.6, Yeah.
2671.6,2672.6," I mean, I'm not really right."
2672.6,2673.6, I want my head.
2673.6,2674.6, I'm a guy.
2674.6,2675.6, Oh my god.
2675.6,2677.6, I'm not really playing the dirty.
2677.6,2680.6, I keep starting over with new advice and the kids.
2680.6,2681.6, Who's your new guy now?
2681.6,2682.6, What's his name?
2682.6,2683.6, He was Gallon.
2683.6,2685.6, Gallon of milk.
2685.6,2686.6, GALL.
2686.6,2687.6," Oh, then."
2687.6,2688.6, Nice.
2688.6,2690.6, He's working in the street.
2690.6,2692.6, That is sad.
2692.6,2693.6, Like the minstrel.
2693.6,2694.6, Really?
2694.6,2695.6, Yeah.
2695.6,2696.6, So what you do?
2696.6,2697.6, You like saying to heal people?
2697.6,2698.6, That right?
2698.6,2699.6, Who like you?
2699.6,2700.6, You're playing your loot.
2700.6,2701.6, So far.
2701.6,2702.6," Oh, that's the class that does that."
2702.6,2703.6, You're saying that people to help or.
2703.6,2704.6, Yeah.
2704.6,2706.6," So it's like, do you're going to fight in Europe on the hill?"
2706.6,2707.6, You're all doing.
2707.6,2708.6, You're all doing.
2708.6,2710.6, You're all getting stronger.
2710.6,2711.6, Good books for that.
2711.6,2712.6, Yeah.
2712.6,2715.6, That's pretty much what you do.
2715.6,2718.6, Do you think that's your mic while you're.
2718.6,2719.6, Standard card.
2719.6,2720.6, Standard card.
2720.6,2721.6, To Bard.
2721.6,2722.6, Yeah.
2722.6,2724.6, I'm not going to be an awesome mechanic.
2724.6,2726.6, If you could actually use voice chat to do that.
2726.6,2727.6, That's the DS version.
2727.6,2728.6, I'm feeling good.
2728.6,2729.6, For 12.
2729.6,2730.6," Oh, I jumped."
2730.6,2731.6, I'm a.
2731.6,2732.6," No, well, the."
2732.6,2733.6, The.
2733.6,2734.6, The.
2734.6,2737.6, We're going to move on to the.
2737.6,2738.6," Yeah, yeah, that's."
2738.6,2741.6," That they hurt the monsters, but then they also do something beneficial."
2741.6,2742.6, Wow.
2742.6,2743.6, You're singing heard people.
2743.6,2744.6, The monsters.
2744.6,2745.6, Yeah.
2745.6,2750.6," They're, like, well, and their loot, the monster would be like way over on the other side of the."
2750.6,2751.6, You know.
2751.6,2752.6, Yeah.
2752.6,2753.6, So it's like.
2753.6,2754.6, Whaleing un-leewed.
2754.6,2755.6, You like that?
2755.6,2756.6, Concept.
2756.6,2757.6, Yeah.
2757.6,2758.6, I'm.
2758.6,2760.6, You know.
2760.6,2763.6, Do you imagine songs in your head as your.
2763.6,2765.6, you're attacking him with your flu.
2765.6,2766.7999999999997, There should be downloadables.
2766.7999999999997,2768.6," I said, loot, not slew."
2768.6,2772.6," Sorry, fellas, what's the right?"
2772.6,2773.6, I guess.
2773.6,2775.6, Either downloadable songs.
2775.6,2777.6, I know.
2777.6,2778.6, What is this?
2778.6,2783.6, You've some system within the game where you can make music to the movie degree.
2783.6,2784.6," Oh, I can make it."
2784.6,2787.6," If you could destroy galaxies, that was awesome."
2787.6,2788.6," Yeah, that's right."
2788.6,2789.6, You can learn that.
2789.6,2791.6," What is love on your, on the movie?"
2791.6,2792.6, That's true.
2792.6,2794.6," Well, this is the word that, right?"
2794.6,2798.6," Since he's been gone, yeah, you could just start, you know, Boston happy."
2798.6,2799.6, That wasn't.
2799.6,2800.6, I never get annoying.
2800.6,2804.6, What's such haters?
2804.6,2808.6, I only see the bad potential on anything.
2808.6,2810.6, That's why you worried.
2810.6,2811.6, That's why we hired you.
2811.6,2812.6," No, we just had to fart."
2812.6,2814.6," I mean, what are we going to say?"
2814.6,2816.6," Dude, it's just so good."
2816.6,2818.6, You're a minster.
2818.6,2819.6, I'm out in the fields.
2819.6,2820.6, Yeah.
2820.6,2823.6," And, you know, there are like, Zargadil bears come in."
2823.6,2825.6," Which are like the normal bears, except their blue."
2825.6,2826.6, Right.
2826.6,2828.6," But these guys, you know, they're like little 20."
2828.6,2829.6, So I get up on the crest.
2829.6,2830.6, Yeah.
2830.6,2832.6," And I just like launch into, you know, you're the wind beneath my wings."
2832.6,2834.6," My teammates, you can see them."
2834.6,2836.6," Like I could tell in, they were a team speak."
2836.6,2839.6," But even if they weren't, I could tell that I was a blifting of, that they were becoming"
2839.6,2840.6, more powerful.
2840.6,2842.6," And that, therefore, they had a great enhance."
2842.6,2844.6," Like, they had a beating those bears."
2844.6,2845.6, I was doing slash.
2845.6,2846.6, Slash fits.
2846.6,2847.6, Why?
2847.6,2848.6, That's great.
2848.6,2851.6, So do you get like famous token songs like in your collection?

2854.6,2856.6," Is the, hey, a loothian bitch?"
2856.6,2858.6, Is that a real token song?
2858.6,2859.6, It's on my phone.
2859.6,2860.6, It's my case.
2860.6,2861.6," I'm from Tom Bombadil, song."
2861.6,2862.6, Yeah.
2862.6,2864.6," When I say the Dargadil Hills or something, I've made a recommendation."
2864.6,2865.6, I'm not a Dargadil.
2865.6,2866.6, I'm not a Dargadil.
2866.6,2867.6, I'm not a Dargadil.
2867.6,2869.6," You're a psycho-video, fucking."
2869.6,2870.6, Well.

2880.6,2882.6," I'm, I went back to volume."
2882.6,2885.6, So that I got to the loothian level.
2885.6,2888.6," Soon as I got, I got my exclude and I could spam people with it,"
2888.6,2891.6," then I was like, it's just the same as any of these names."
2891.6,2894.6, But you've never made a past any reasonable level.
2894.6,2895.6, I did.
2895.6,2896.6, I ascended.
2896.6,2898.6," I got to level 20, the guild ors."
2898.6,2899.6, Did you?
2899.6,2900.6, Yeah.
2900.6,2901.6, I think that can't count.
2901.6,2902.6, That's a name scenario.
2902.6,2905.6," And level 20, the guild ors of courses like the,"
2905.6,2907.6," as high as it goes, the cap."
2907.6,2908.6, Right.
2908.6,2909.6," I can't, the cap."
2909.6,2910.6, I've been corrected.
2910.6,2912.6," I apologize to you, Sean."
2912.6,2915.6, I'm very excited to kind of write a song about you.
2915.6,2918.6," I apologize to you, Sean."
2918.6,2919.6, Alien.
2919.6,2920.6, Right.
2920.6,2921.6, And we're all just healed.
2921.6,2922.6," Yeah, you can-"
2922.6,2923.6, No way.
2923.6,2924.6, I don't know what to do.
2924.6,2926.6," I don't know where to live, but it makes me feel."
2926.6,2929.6," Right, we're, we're, we're just kind of hitting our deadline deadline."
2929.6,2932.6," Ryan, you had real quick before you go, you had some leader."
2932.6,2933.6, Questions?
2933.6,2934.6, Listener.
2934.6,2936.6, We want to talk about the one shadow and thing.
2936.6,2939.6, Does this happen just yesterday online?
2939.6,2941.6, I will talk about it if we want to talk about it.
2941.6,2943.6," No, we get busted when we do that."
2943.6,2944.6," No, go."
2944.6,2945.6," All right, there was a crack."
2945.6,2946.6, Drop it.
2946.6,2947.6," No, we're not going to talk about that."
2947.6,2948.6," No, talk about it."
2948.6,2949.6, Drop it.
2949.6,2950.6, Drop it.
2950.6,2951.6, I just couldn't.
2951.6,2952.6, You're using that cooling go on.
2952.6,2953.6," Okay, yeah."
2953.6,2955.6, I will drop some knowledge on you.
2955.6,2958.6, This is bad as an adult or bad as an adult.
2958.6,2960.6, Drop it.
2960.6,2962.6, Shadow run.
2962.6,2967.92," Apparently, somebody found out that if you just take a few files out of the directory, the ones"
2967.92,2970.6," that say like, this is this to only."
2970.6,2973.6, You now suddenly have a non-vist to only game.
2973.6,2975.6, Now it's suddenly the game can run on XB.
2975.6,2976.6, Right?
2976.6,2978.6, Just kind of a walls sort of moment.
2978.6,2984.6, It's just confirms what we do is that the game doesn't necessarily need the X10 or whatever.
2984.6,2985.6, Right.
2985.6,2986.6, Right.
2986.6,2987.6, But it needs to simply.
2987.6,2988.6, They need the game to self-ista.
2988.6,2989.6, Right.
2989.6,2991.6, But it does still need this.
2991.6,2992.6, It needs to play.
2992.6,2993.6, Right.
2993.6,2994.6, Right.
2994.6,2996.6," Which is the only way to play the game, right?"
2996.6,2997.6, But it doesn't technically.
2997.6,2999.6, It doesn't need that that sort of decision too.
2999.6,3000.6," Well, yeah, that's there."
3000.6,3002.6, It's going to be an extent of done without that obviously.
3002.6,3004.6, But an that's there decision for that game.
3004.6,3005.6, Yes.
3005.6,3009.6, But I just realized that I almost revealed something I know about some other games that
3009.6,3011.6, are going to be on games for Windows Live.
3011.6,3012.6, I'll spell it you tease.
3012.6,3013.6, No.
3013.6,3015.6, You don't want to be spilled with stuff.
3015.6,3016.6, But we'll come back.
3016.6,3017.6," Don't it, Shadow."
3017.6,3018.6, A few weeks from now we will.
3018.6,3020.6, And there's evidence that.
3021.6,3023.6," Oh, I hate when people do that."
3023.6,3024.6, I do too.
3024.6,3025.6, I honestly didn't mean to do it.
3025.6,3026.6, I wasn't I wasn't doing that.
3026.6,3027.6," So we'd be like, buy our bags."
3027.6,3028.6, Buy our bags.
3028.6,3029.6, Buy our bags.
3029.6,3030.6, We saw it first.
3030.6,3032.6, It's a bar that's a menstrual song.
3032.6,3033.6, We got this was the first.
3033.6,3034.6, We saw first.
3034.6,3035.6, We went on.
3035.6,3036.6, That is.
3036.6,3037.6, We saw before anyone.
3037.6,3038.6, First.
3038.6,3039.6, All right.
3039.6,3040.6," So yeah, it's just a."
3040.6,3041.6, It's just one of those things.
3041.6,3042.6," So it's like, okay."
3042.6,3044.6," Well, you know, like, I."
3044.6,3046.6, I never got around to saying it.
3046.6,3047.6, I'm running this to it.
3047.6,3048.6," Oh, no."
3048.6,3049.6, And I like you.
3049.6,3050.1," Yeah, you do like it."
3050.1,3051.1, And you're a conference.
3051.1,3052.1, It's done me good.
3052.1,3053.1, I like it.
3053.1,3054.1, For windows.
3054.1,3055.1, No problems.
3055.1,3056.1," Yeah, no problems with that."
3056.1,3057.1, So you're wondering the whole time.
3057.1,3059.1," It's like, you guys are just a crust still faster."
3059.1,3060.1, So you're always afraid of change.
3060.1,3061.1, I see.
3061.1,3063.1, I know you're now you're being that way.
3063.1,3068.1, Or maybe you got burned by in the past in ways by new operating systems where I had to have.
3068.1,3069.1, I have.
3069.1,3070.1," So I can say, okay, we'll call that."
3070.1,3071.1, That's that don't make you crusty.
3071.1,3072.1, And rightfully so.
3072.1,3073.1, And what I said.
3073.1,3076.1, Outside of the problem with creatives drivers.
3076.1,3078.1, And that's definitely a problem with creative.
3078.1,3082.1, And she all the hate directed toward them on their because they what actually fixed it was three
3082.1,3086.1, dudes put together some piecemeal thing that worked better than their driver.
3086.1,3088.1," But everything else, it's nice."
3088.1,3090.1, It's cool to use.
3090.1,3092.1," And you know, it's just like in OS."
3092.1,3095.1, You don't really notice that much of a difference until it just creeps in your life.
3095.1,3098.1, And then you go and I come to the office and I use XP.
3098.1,3100.1, And like it's feels kind of ghetto.
3100.1,3101.1," Yeah, you know."
3101.1,3103.1, You know what I'm even doing on the machine here is pretty.
3103.1,3104.1, It's pretty.
3104.1,3107.1, I think Microsoft contacted Sean Elliott behind my back.
3108.1,3112.1," Yeah, we're thinking you might make a better editor and chief Sean Elliott."
3112.1,3114.1, We're just getting on there.
3114.1,3115.1, We're talking this stuff.
3115.1,3118.1," You know, we spent so much time and we're so vocal with our skepticism."
3118.1,3122.1," I think it would be only fair to come back after all that down in the day like hey,"
3122.1,3125.1, like I have nothing bad.
3125.1,3127.1, I don't know the single bad thing to say about it.
3127.1,3129.1," And you know, that's cool."
3129.1,3131.1," Well, I mean, I, we've talked about this before."
3131.1,3133.1, I think we all assume we are going to be on this day.
3133.1,3136.1," Yeah, I'm ready for the equivalent of service pack one basically."
3136.1,3139.1, Right when when those XP were not really enough.
3139.1,3143.1," Like for example, I'm not getting in line for a freaking iPhone this week."
3143.1,3147.1," Yeah, let's let all the other suckers spend their 500 bucks."
3147.1,3149.1, And I'm going to all wait for a version two.
3149.1,3151.1, All the bugs that they worked out.
3151.1,3152.1, Exactly.
3152.1,3153.1, They're going to look like some.
3153.1,3155.1," Ryan, you have a way to lie for an iPhone?"
3155.1,3156.1," Oh, no."
3156.1,3158.1, Darren will.
3158.1,3161.1, Probably already got like five.
3161.1,3164.1, I was waiting to see who said that.
3164.1,3165.1, I got that job with you.
3165.1,3167.1, I'm going to be selling him on eBay.
3167.1,3168.1, All right.
3168.1,3170.1," No, no, doesn't dare in all these."
3170.1,3171.1, We love you.
3171.1,3172.1, Darren.
3172.1,3174.1, And the kids is that a ride.
3174.1,3178.1," Ryan, you got some questions."
3178.1,3183.1," We, we read our questions and then we're going to read our questions."
3183.1,3184.1, Read the one about you.
3184.1,3186.1," I didn't, I didn't print that one."
3186.1,3191.1," But, but I will read questions from this same guy who we're at that one about me."
3192.1,3194.1, He's PC load better.
3194.1,3195.1, And nice.
3195.1,3196.1, I like that.
3196.1,3197.1, PC load better.
3197.1,3198.1, Asked.
3198.1,3202.1," But, could you guys perhaps have made sense and talked about PC games and limit the bull"
3202.1,3206.1, crap to say maybe one through the podcast versus the 90% level with that now?
3206.1,3207.1, No.
3207.1,3208.1, Next question.
3208.1,3209.1, Question.
3209.1,3211.1, I think we have 80%.
3211.1,3213.1, And we talked about PC games this week.
3213.1,3214.1, Okay.
3214.1,3215.1, The next question.
3215.1,3216.1," You're happy now, load letter."
3216.1,3218.1, Get off our back.
3218.1,3223.1, The next question is not really a question but I can't skip it.
3223.1,3224.1, I got to read this in a way.
3224.1,3225.1, It's some crisis.
3225.1,3227.1, Captain Spears.
3227.1,3230.1, And reading this as it is written.
3230.1,3236.1," Hey, you guys can't really say anything about those animals like Cabo Hotel and those other"
3236.1,3238.1, one without playing them yourself.
3238.1,3243.1," Hey, I bet you guys each 20 bucks for you guys to try it."
3243.1,3244.1, Okay.
3245.1,3247.1," That's not a challenge, is it?"
3247.1,3248.1," Oh, this fucking way."
3248.1,3249.1, Go to the best.
3249.1,3250.1, What do you have on the table?
3250.1,3251.1, What's your betting on?
3251.1,3253.1, It's the NES 20 bucks for a play.
3253.1,3254.1, Yeah.
3254.1,3256.1, I'll take that bet.
3256.1,3257.1, There I played it.
3257.1,3259.1, I'll play it right after this.
3259.1,3260.1, Okay.
3260.1,3261.1, You're going to have an A box.
3261.1,3263.1, I think that was Cabo himself.
3263.1,3265.1, Stay where I was having a good time.
3265.1,3266.1, Where are you going to do my whole day?
3266.1,3268.1, I am a hobo.
3268.1,3271.1," You know, nothing about this game at all."
3272.1,3273.1, Yeah.
3273.1,3274.1, It's true.
3274.1,3275.1, I want to know.
3275.1,3277.1," Um, anyone question?"
3277.1,3280.1, I thought this was a question that's down the bed.
3280.1,3283.1, A Kim Slayer in the F.
3283.1,3285.1," Well, will a time name?"
3285.1,3286.1, That's good.
3286.1,3287.1, And you knew the reference.
3287.1,3288.1, I did know it.
3288.1,3289.1, I've admitted that.
3289.1,3290.1, What's the will of time?
3290.1,3292.1," Oh, shitty science."
3292.1,3293.1, Fantasy series.
3293.1,3295.1, I still have that stuff.
3295.1,3297.1, You have a retoken.
3297.1,3298.1, This is like a.
3298.1,3300.1, This is talking like.
3301.1,3302.1, Like a fine.
3302.1,3303.1, It's absolutely.
3303.1,3304.1, Yeah.
3304.1,3305.1, Anyway.
3305.1,3306.1, Yeah.
3306.1,3310.1, So he says one genre that has not crossed over between platforms.
3310.1,3313.1, Consoles in PC is the.
3313.1,3314.1, The.
3314.1,3315.1, The.
3315.1,3316.1, The.
3316.1,3317.1, The.
3317.1,3319.1, You think it has to do with a perceived platform bias.
3319.1,3322.1, Are we're hearing or got a bit like a focus.
3322.1,3323.1, Testing.
3323.1,3324.1, Also do you find it.
3325.1,3326.1, And so.
3326.1,3327.1, I think that.
3327.1,3329.1, I think that would be good.
3329.1,3330.1, And.
3330.1,3333.1, I think that would be good.
3333.1,3334.1, And.
3334.1,3335.1, And.
3335.1,3337.1, And that would be.
3337.1,3338.1, So.
3338.1,3340.1," So he's basically saying, like why I said,"
3340.1,3341.1, what?
3341.1,3342.1, What does.
3342.1,3343.1, We have to the bra.
3343.1,3345.1, A bra is not a fighting.
3345.1,3346.1, Right.
3346.1,3347.1, A bra.
3347.1,3348.1, And thinking.
3348.1,3349.1," You know,"
3349.1,3350.1, Don't drag in.
3350.1,3351.1," Yeah, or."
3351.1,3353.1," Oh, just that kind of game where you go around and you just keep"
3353.1,3355.3399999999997, and you just keep punching the same dude in the junk at K-D-Mitch.
3355.3399999999997,3356.54," You're fucking over, no, we're getting punched."
3356.54,3359.8199999999997," Now, then you take up a knife, every other level,"
3359.8199999999997,3362.8199999999997, you might get like a gun with three rounds in it.
3362.8199999999997,3364.1, Or a lot of two.
3364.1,3366.14, You need to start delaying for help.
3366.14,3369.42, And that's like all that's born in the arcade
3369.42,3370.7799999999997," and the transition to console,"
3370.7799999999997,3372.54," but we'll see kind of, you know,"
3372.54,3373.3399999999997," brainer on that, but I mean,"
3373.3399999999997,3375.62, do you really want the bouncer on PC?
3375.62,3377.7," You know, no, I don't."
3377.7,3378.98, I want to build that.
3378.98,3381.42, Got a game tap?
3381.42,3384.7000000000003, I think a couple of fighting games in the past
3384.7000000000003,3389.94, have had PC boards and they failed utterly.
3389.94,3391.78, Mainly because it's a social thing.
3391.78,3392.62, It's very interesting.
3392.62,3395.9," Now that they're getting online to work with fighting games,"
3395.9,3398.2200000000003," with respectable fighting games where, you know,"
3398.2200000000003,3400.58," every frame absolutely counts, you know?"
3400.58,3401.42, Yeah.
3401.42,3403.54, So it's been about sitting next to someone doing it.
3403.54,3404.86, There's the interface to talk about.
3404.86,3406.5, It's just now that we're control or passing.
3406.5,3408.1," You know, you know, yeah."
3408.1,3410.66, They're quite a few reasons for it.
3411.62,3414.42," And now I mean, like, control is becoming more and more."
3414.42,3416.42, They had to be more fan of the PC.
3416.42,3416.7799999999997, Right.
3416.7799999999997,3418.8199999999997," But now it's also, I guess you think they haven't been"
3418.8199999999997,3419.66, at a so-called parent.
3419.66,3421.66, And it's a lot of the on that's coming out from PC
3421.66,3423.74," as well as consoles basically a brawler,"
3423.74,3425.94," not a fighting game, but where you go around"
3425.94,3426.8199999999997, and you just imagine.
3426.8199999999997,3427.3399999999997, You come home.
3427.3399999999997,3428.18," I mean, there's some combos."
3428.18,3430.1," When you go around hitting the button to,"
3430.1,3431.54, to you need to shoot out of it.
3431.54,3434.8199999999997," I guess a brawler, ultimately, what a,"
3434.8199999999997,3436.22," a God of Warriors, right?"
3436.22,3437.62," You know, I mean, that's kind of like the,"
3437.62,3438.58, that's the heritage.
3438.58,3440.14, That's what happened to double-draft.
3440.14,3442.3399999999997," I mean, basically, that's what happened when you take a game."
3442.3399999999997,3444.8599999999997, That used to consist of no more than hitting A
3444.8599999999997,3447.3799999999997, and you turn it into hitting A.
3447.3799999999997,3450.1," And occasionally, but you know,"
3450.1,3452.06," there's always like the big and never ending,"
3452.06,3454.14," you know, discussions of like, well,"
3454.14,3456.8599999999997, Devil May Cry is so much deeper and slicker than the other.
3456.8599999999997,3459.3399999999997," But yeah, I mean, I've played both, but,"
3459.3399999999997,3461.94," and you know, it is, it is, you know,"
3461.94,3463.58, there are more options with combos and stuff
3463.58,3464.54, that would grab a lot of work.
3464.54,3465.94," Yeah, you could go and beat it."
3465.94,3468.58," And just do nothing by hit A if you wanted or X or O,"
3468.58,3470.66, whatever it is in the PlayStation show.
3470.66,3473.06," Whoa, aha, aha, 80."
3473.06,3475.54, I hope a compliment to his question.
3475.54,3479.36," Hmm, most of the games that Jonor asked anyway,"
3479.36,3481.2999999999997," there's like, what, what did I review?"
3481.2999999999997,3483.2599999999998," Seven Samurai, 20 XX."
3483.2599999999998,3484.2599999999998, Oh God.
3484.2599999999998,3486.18," That was a game where I did like,"
3486.18,3487.14, I reviewed it for E.J.M.
3487.14,3489.1," and after like I had finished at once,"
3489.1,3492.72," just like Scooter who worked at a PlayStation magazine,"
3492.72,3494.68, we were just like messing around and I would play it.
3494.68,3496.58, And I would beat levels and bosses
3496.58,3498.18, with like without looking.
3498.18,3500.86," Oh, I mean, I turned around and talked to someone"
3500.86,3503.02, and just like spin the analog stick around
3503.02,3504.5, and just keep matching the tag button.
3504.5,3506.74, And I turned around later when I knew the dialogue guy.
3506.74,3507.74," Yeah, one."
3509.02,3510.46," So was there a button to make a chorus,"
3510.46,3512.2999999999997, our spin in his grave?
3512.2999999999997,3514.98," No, but there's a lot for the spinning in a great joke though."
3514.98,3518.2599999999998," Oh, wait, was that actually like,"
3518.2599999999998,3520.94, it's based on the actual movie?
3520.94,3521.94, It's like a mess of one.
3521.94,3524.18," It was a son who was like,"
3524.18,3526.2999999999997, or who trolls the estate.
3526.3,3527.46, That hurts me.
3527.46,3529.1400000000003," It was one of those, yeah, I don't know."
3529.1400000000003,3530.26," I mean, everyone will forget it."
3530.26,3531.94," They're like, hey, whatever."
3531.94,3534.5800000000004," Like, this shit will be forgotten until some people"
3534.5800000000004,3535.5800000000004, are going to podcast.
3535.5800000000004,3538.38," You're gonna go, two years from now."
3538.38,3540.82, We had to think of all the other classical porn films
3540.82,3542.42, that they could make a game out of.
3542.42,3544.46, They could be bicycle thieves.
3544.46,3546.6200000000003," Are there any others that have,"
3546.6200000000003,3548.9, maybe some Bergman films would make great games?
3548.9,3551.0600000000004," Prize and whispers, the video games."
3551.0600000000004,3554.2200000000003," There's, and they all, they should all be that game,"
3554.2200000000003,3555.78, basically.
3555.78,3558.6200000000003," That's the most, yeah, just for the case of it."
3558.6200000000003,3560.2200000000003, Just press the button to the pot shed.
3560.2200000000003,3564.0600000000004," Seven seal, brawl death to the death."
3564.0600000000004,3566.02," Okay, I'm man, I only got a hundred blocks."
3566.02,3567.98, Sweetest into my humor.
3567.98,3569.38," Oh, oh."
3569.38,3570.9," Park, Park, Park, Park."
3570.9,3571.7400000000002, Hi.
3575.1400000000003,3576.1800000000003, Next question.
3576.1800000000003,3577.9," Yeah, I'm a log."
3577.9,3578.7400000000002," Oh, we got more."
3578.7400000000002,3580.7400000000002, I just signed with it.
3580.7400000000002,3582.34," Okay, live radio here."
3582.34,3585.78," Oh, good."
3585.78,3587.6600000000003," Good, well, we're here, fine."
3587.6600000000003,3590.7400000000002, This is from the literature.
3590.7400000000002,3593.6200000000003," And he says, it seems like steam will be doing everything"
3593.6200000000003,3596.2200000000003, that the TFW light promises to do except for a clock
3596.2200000000003,3597.34, on fire.
3597.34,3599.1000000000004, It will remain one hundred percent free.
3599.1000000000004,3601.94," That's four hundred percent games, including on a steam game."
3601.94,3604.38," They're the closest TFW light to the support games,"
3604.38,3605.82, but they're all feature ports that are now
3605.82,3608.58," and they're really, really aware of it."
3608.58,3611.06, And likely nothing for the rest of the year.
3611.06,3613.34, I'm also interested in hearing what the TFW games can
3613.34,3614.18, just say about that.
3614.18,3615.98," So, especially the comments on how they can steam."
3615.98,3618.58, I'll take a live on steam.
3618.58,3620.22, We have talked about it more.
3620.22,3624.2999999999997," And whenever we bring up, I came to Swindows Live."
3624.2999999999997,3626.58, And we ask about the price point thing.
3626.58,3628.46," For people assuming you don't already,"
3628.46,3632.1," you already a gold subscriber, who are you in 360, nice box."
3632.1,3634.58," It's like, yeah, exactly what this guy says."
3634.58,3635.62, You've got steam.
3635.62,3636.54, It's got friends list.
3636.54,3638.74, It has so much functionality to it.
3638.74,3641.74, It's a virtual store.
3641.74,3642.8199999999997, It's excellent in that.
3642.8199999999997,3646.9399999999996, It even has features that even.
3646.9399999999996,3647.7799999999997, It's been around longer.
3647.7799999999997,3648.62, It should have.
3648.62,3650.7, But it has several features that games Swindows Live
3650.7,3651.8599999999997, is not offering yet.
3651.8599999999997,3653.2999999999997, It's not even saying it's going off.
3653.2999999999997,3657.02," I love the fact that when you buy something on there,"
3657.02,3658.7, you're free to uninstall it and reinstall it.
3658.7,3659.74, It's made in times of the point.
3659.74,3661.7799999999997," I've gone through so many computers this past year,"
3661.7799999999997,3662.8599999999997, every single time.
3662.8599999999997,3664.3799999999997, It's great within an hour.
3664.3799999999997,3666.66," I got once you turn on the thing in the OS,"
3666.66,3668.22, it's like open up steam.
3668.22,3669.7799999999997," Oh, we got all these games back again."
3669.7799999999997,3672.14, I don't have to dig out the codes and all that stuff.
3672.14,3673.18, And that's just the least of it.
3673.18,3676.66," Steam every like four or every three or four months,"
3676.66,3679.2999999999997, they do something to it and it gets better.
3679.2999999999997,3683.5, You can even more value for the one you're not paying.
3683.5,3684.54, Unless you're buying stuff on there.
3684.54,3687.62," But yeah, they're bringing more and more games"
3687.62,3689.4199999999996," under your developers under their umbrella,"
3689.4199999999996,3691.66, publishers that are on board.
3691.66,3693.3399999999997, And that's the big thing.
3693.3399999999997,3696.5," They have to, James Swindows Live is going up against that."
3696.5,3697.7, There's no doubt about it.
3697.7,3699.4199999999996," And Valve is a track that you know,"
3699.4199999999996,3701.8199999999997," it's like, you guys are making our payment,"
3701.8199999999997,3703.2599999999998, they're making the cross and then stuff.
3703.2599999999998,3704.4199999999996," I mean, and it goes that way too."
3704.4199999999996,3706.14," They're like, hey, do you want to make your game"
3706.14,3708.18, and make it available or are things?
3708.18,3710.06, Where you're suddenly adding all this value
3710.06,3714.14, to your potential audience customers.
3714.14,3715.06, And you're not having to charge
3715.06,3716.8199999999997," anything more for, you know,"
3716.8199999999997,3718.58," you're not having to prove that people like this,"
3718.58,3720.4199999999996," we've already done that, you know?"
3720.4199999999996,3721.5," I mean, yeah, you've got to do,"
3721.5,3724.58," you've got to come in and do something to say,"
3724.58,3725.9399999999996," like, we're serious about this."
3725.94,3728.06, And that's a serious threat.
3728.06,3728.9, There's no doubt about it.
3728.9,3730.7000000000003, Steam right now is kick ass.
3730.7000000000003,3731.54, Yeah.
3731.54,3732.38, Taking that into consideration.
3732.38,3733.66, Though everyone's steam came out.
3733.66,3736.1," Everyone's like, what the hell is this shit?"
3736.1,3736.98, And they're all pissed off.
3736.98,3738.78, And you guys gave it the poster of the year awards.
3738.78,3739.62, We did.
3739.62,3742.5, So that also goes to show you that things can change.
3742.5,3743.34, And it's a great job.
3743.34,3746.18," Public opinion can change the quality, the service can change."
3746.18,3747.98," And hey, who's to rule out the game's for"
3747.98,3748.82, this life?
3748.82,3750.26," It's not going to seem like this incredible,"
3750.26,3751.34, no brainer a year from now.
3751.34,3753.18," We're like, God, how did we get by without this?"
3753.18,3754.02, Right.
3754.02,3755.18, We're the way that always go about steam now.
3755.18,3757.8999999999996," Well, it still has a lot to prove."
3757.8999999999996,3759.8199999999997, That was a great question from that guy.
3759.8199999999997,3760.18, Yeah.
3760.18,3762.62," And yeah, right now, steam's kicking its ass and moves out."
3762.62,3765.02, But see.
3765.02,3766.7, One last question.
3766.7,3767.94, And then we did out.
3767.94,3768.94, We're right.
3768.94,3773.1, And I'm divided up into the food and dumb.
3773.1,3773.8199999999997, Did he read it?
3773.8199999999997,3775.1, He's going to bring us out of the one that's
3775.1,3776.58, one or a good one.
3776.58,3778.7799999999997, I'm going to put that one on the other.
3778.7799999999997,3780.1, That was very harsh.
3780.1,3780.94, That was great.
3780.94,3782.18, Now those sea segments can stop.
3782.18,3783.18, That was a lot of trauma.
3783.18,3785.1, That was great.
3785.1,3786.1, All right.
3786.1,3788.1, So don tell us what's category.
3788.1,3789.1, This is a good one.
3789.1,3793.9," This is from James Kron, who says,"
3793.9,3796.9, who games like Halo 2 last plant and eventually
3796.9,3799.2999999999997, gears a board coming to PC a year or two after their
3799.2999999999997,3802.1," console release, do you think it would be more beneficial"
3802.1,3804.54, for coming to these both versions on the same date.
3804.54,3806.5," And in your opinion, we're just having negative effects"
3806.5,3809.02, on the PC games landscape because the comfort
3809.02,3810.8199999999997, port is coming more of the features that makes
3810.8199999999997,3812.98, these new experience today.
3812.98,3814.98, Are you sure you want more of a few reports?
3814.98,3816.98, Talk to the front page.
3816.98,3818.98," Oh, why don't you bring up these questions?"
3818.98,3820.98, Would take half an hour to answer.
3820.98,3823.98, I'm trying to get out of here.
3823.98,3824.98, Jerk.
3824.98,3825.98, Bring them out.
3825.98,3826.98, Lots.
3826.98,3827.98, That's a good question.
3827.98,3829.98, I'd like to have the option.
3829.98,3830.98, I'd like the app.
3830.98,3833.98," If Microsoft did, like a day and date release,"
3833.98,3836.98," Halo 3, PC and Xbox."
3836.98,3839.58," Well, some of these, we have talked about this on"
3839.58,3840.58, long-starts sales.
3840.58,3843.98, I personally do not believe that releasing something
3843.98,3848.38, simultaneously on PC would hurt console sales.
3848.38,3849.58, Maybe I'm a dumbass.
3849.58,3853.38," I just feel like, you know, all that you're probably really"
3853.38,3856.38, going to do is get PC guys who would normally not buy
3856.38,3858.7799999999997, the game at all because they don't have the console.
3858.7799999999997,3860.18, Look at the jump on board.
3860.18,3862.7799999999997," Recent examples, Elder Scrolls 4 of Libyan, you know,"
3862.7799999999997,3863.2799999999997, exact.
3863.2799999999997,3864.2799999999997, That came out for both.
3864.2799999999997,3866.38," It had some of the issues where you're like, okay,"
3866.38,3869.7799999999997, they did these aspects of the game reflect the fact that
3869.78,3871.38, exists on two platforms.
3871.38,3872.38, It came out the time.
3872.38,3873.38, The game did well.
3873.38,3876.5800000000004," But it was like, it did well on both and I chose to play it on PC."
3876.5800000000004,3880.1800000000003, So I was finding out what I was happy with that.
3880.1800000000003,3883.38," Whereas I, if that game had come out at the same time,"
3883.38,3885.38," if it came out a year later, I would have already"
3885.38,3886.38, a play on the game.
3886.38,3886.5800000000004, Yeah.
3886.5800000000004,3888.5800000000004," What I got, what I said to you, you're probably less so up."
3888.5800000000004,3892.38, But I would have found a less appealing if it came out later on
3892.38,3893.38, for a game.
3893.38,3895.5800000000004," Yeah, I'm interested in I'm going to go play it."
3895.5800000000004,3896.78, It's how it is.
3896.78,3898.98," Sometimes the simultaneous, I mean,"
3899.38,3902.98," having a non-symotainee shift for multiple platforms,"
3902.98,3905.78, doesn't guarantee that the game's going to be any more adapted
3905.78,3908.58, better adapted to the PC platform anyway.
3908.58,3910.18," Look, it doesn't evil in this game."
3910.18,3910.78, Right.
3910.78,3913.58," You know, it depends on what I was doing it clearly."
3913.58,3917.78," But yeah, hopefully the simultaneous release would be more"
3917.78,3919.78, really a thing of the future.
3919.78,3924.18," And that won't be the big, Brecken thing about that."
3924.18,3927.58," I mean, maybe Microsoft and everybody else will"
3927.58,3930.38," get over that notion that these games,"
3930.38,3932.38, they need these games to drive the console.
3932.38,3935.34," So I mean, who the hell who has an F-R-System system is not"
3935.34,3936.7799999999997, going to buy here?
3936.7799999999997,3937.38, I'm going to buy it.
3937.38,3938.38, We're all going to buy it.
3938.38,3938.7799999999997, Right.
3938.7799999999997,3939.38, Yeah.
3939.38,3940.58, How would you buy it?
3940.58,3942.58," Well, you don't care."
3942.58,3943.58, OK.
3943.58,3946.18, But OK.
3946.18,3950.18," But maybe I'm blowing this analogy, because if it came out on,"
3950.18,3952.58," if Halo 3 came out on PC at the same time,"
3952.58,3954.18, you get the controller for you to get the controller.
3954.18,3955.58, It's a bit trauma to get it.
3955.58,3956.38, I get the 360.
3956.38,3957.38, Which is why I would.
3957.38,3958.38," For that, I'm a game."
3958.38,3959.38, It's a very specific game.
3959.38,3962.78," But for a blivion, like you guys said, I had the choice."
3962.78,3963.98, I received both for free.
3963.98,3966.1800000000003, And I chose to play the PC version on purpose.
3966.1800000000003,3967.98, And it's hard to generalize too.
3967.98,3969.78, Call duty for modern warfare.
3969.78,3970.78, It's coming out to both.
3970.78,3971.98, That's one of getting on PC.
3971.98,3972.78, I would play that on PC.
3972.78,3977.86, Even though it's because Halo is so specifically tuned for a
3977.86,3978.38, controller.
3978.38,3979.38, Yeah.
3979.38,3984.58," And for playing on their TV and stuff, whereas it's finnitty war."
3984.58,3986.58, And so the quality was born on PC.
3986.58,3987.58, So that's a chicken in the world.
3987.58,3988.58, So that really does tell.
3988.58,3990.58, So they could put it on PC.
3990.58,3992.58, They could put Halo 3 on PC simultaneously.
3992.58,3993.58, But they're still going to sell it.
3993.58,3995.58, They develop all these games on PC.
3995.58,3997.58, So they'll sell their games on PC.
3997.58,3999.58, Here's a warning about what you see.
3999.58,4000.58, Right.
4000.58,4001.58, That's kind of a chicken in the X.
4001.58,4004.58," In the scenario, like with Halo 3, because it's not going to go to PC."
4004.58,4007.58," They're designed specifically only for a console, really."
4007.58,4010.58, And then they don't really take the PC into consideration.
4010.58,4013.58," But at the point, if they're, though, is Microsoft wants to"
4013.58,4016.58, differentiate its product across the platforms.
4016.58,4020.58," They don't want it to just be like, hey, look, here's, you know, you have these two"
4020.58,4022.58, and it's your choice or whatever.
4022.58,4024.58," I mean, like, ideally, they want you to be playing both."
4024.58,4025.58," I mean, that's right."
4025.58,4026.58, Master plan.
4026.58,4029.58, That's why you have this unified live account across both.
4029.58,4032.58," But to do that, they need to have like, it would have been a no-brent, right?"
4032.58,4036.58," Instead of giving us Halo 2 Vista, what if, when live launched, what if Halo"
4036.58,4038.58," Wars, and then come out, and it was a PC game."
4038.58,4042.58," You're like, hey, PC, mouse keyboard works great on symbols, a PC development."
4042.58,4043.58, Let's do this.
4043.58,4045.58," But instead, you get to this weird shit."
4045.58,4049.58," Like, again, like, quite, I mean, if Halo Wars is on a console first, then we find out"
4049.58,4053.58," it's coming out in another eight months later, and I mean, then it's, then that's when"
4053.58,4055.58," it's like, what's the deal?"
4055.58,4056.58," No, care about us."
4056.58,4057.58," Oh, yeah, yeah."
4057.58,4058.58, Yeah.
4058.58,4061.58," It's a, it's a good wish."
4061.58,4062.58," It's a wonderful, yeah."
4062.58,4063.58, That would be.
4063.58,4066.58, Imagine there's no platforms.
4066.58,4076.58," I see, see, see, see, I know on those."
4076.58,4084.58, There's a lift for a mouse.
4084.58,4087.58, And we.
