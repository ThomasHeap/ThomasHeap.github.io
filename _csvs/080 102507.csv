132.6,134.6, I'm 136 pounds.
134.6,136.6, That's a fucking skinny man.
136.6,138.4, But that's up from you said a year ago.
138.4,139.4, Is that what's close on?

150.84,152.84," Yeah, you've got to go with that."
152.84,154.84, Like you could you could have been like I'm trying to keep it down.
154.84,156.84, I got to get back to one ten.
156.84,160.84, I got about two weeks left of training subways sandwiches.
160.84,165.84," Yeah, I don't think I ever hit 120 until well after high school."
165.84,166.84, Wow.
166.84,167.84, So.
167.84,169.84, But I love I love how for for a for a woman.
169.84,174.84, It would be terrible for someone to say that they weighed over 130 pounds.
174.84,177.84," But for a guy, it's like 130 pounds."
177.84,178.84, Yeah.
178.84,179.84, Weekland.
179.84,180.84, Yeah.
180.84,183.84, I can't do anything to get under 175.
183.84,185.84, Nothing I do.
185.84,187.84, I like not eat for two weeks.
187.84,190.84, I'll be like jogging every day and then I'll find the get on the scale.
190.84,191.84," And I'm like, this is it."
191.84,192.84, I did it.
192.84,194.84," It's like, why want you gained five."
194.84,195.84, Wow.
196.84,201.84, Did it make you sad that I could eat anything all day forever and not gain a pound?
201.84,205.84," No, but see a it determines your life span your metabolism."
205.84,208.84, So if your metabolism is pop pop pop pop pop pop pop.
208.84,209.84, That's it.
209.84,211.84, I'm a mosquito you're going to die in like five years.
211.84,212.84," Oh, true."
212.84,215.84," So if you get the slow metabolism, you might be big."
215.84,217.84," But if you can avoid the diabetes, you could be for a long."
217.84,218.84, Right.
218.84,221.84, Actually part of the wing wing story that you cut me off on.
221.84,222.84, Yeah.
222.84,223.84, I can't get back to it.
223.84,227.84, I actually had a lot of people write me saying that they wanted to hear the full story of wing wing wing wing.
227.84,232.84, And I had many others offered to edit stealth edit the Wikipedia entry on wing wing.
232.84,237.84, But the other the thing about him is that he doesn't sleep much like a hummingbird.
237.84,240.84," He doesn't sleep, but on he he hibernates nightly."
240.84,242.84, So there you go.
242.84,243.84, Full on.
243.84,244.84, I'm waiting.
244.84,245.84, What's the difference between?
245.84,246.84, Yeah.
246.84,247.84, What's much deeper.
247.84,248.84, It's much deeper.
248.84,249.84, And it allows you to conserve.
249.84,250.84," I mean, sleep."
250.84,255.84, You use up a lot more calories and energy than you would while hibernating hibernates like near comma state.
255.84,260.84000000000003," So you know, your pulse and everything slows down radically."
260.84000000000003,266.84000000000003," So yeah, hummingbirds are actually much the state that they're in on a nightly basis as much closer to hibernation."
266.84000000000003,268.84000000000003, So Ryan's like a hummingbird.
268.84000000000003,269.84000000000003, Yeah.
269.84000000000003,270.84000000000003, Stop aging.
270.84000000000003,280.8," You know, I saw an article on the front page of the SF Chronicles website yesterday front page news article that said that there were new studies that linked to"
280.8,284.8, the fact that there was a lot of people who had a lot of sleep to irritability.
284.8,285.8, Really.
285.8,286.8, Wow.
286.8,287.8, How much you get paid for that study?
287.8,288.8, Is that the onion?
288.8,289.8, Yeah.
289.8,291.8, You are kidding me.
291.8,293.8, I sent that article to everybody.
293.8,294.8, You're not going to believe this.
294.8,297.8," If you don't sleep, you're going to be irritable."
297.8,300.8, But lots of money poured into research in the obvious these days.
300.8,301.8, Yeah.
301.8,308.8, I saw a new story recently that was some study that proved that that guys tend to go for a attractive women.
309.8,311.8," Oh, I saw that article too."
311.8,312.8, Right.
312.8,313.8, And then a conversation.
313.8,317.8," Yeah, a person to go for signs of wealth."
317.8,318.8, I saw that same thing.
318.8,319.8," It's like, wow."
319.8,320.8, That's really inside.
320.8,321.8, Really?
321.8,322.8, Thank you.
322.8,323.8, Like wealthy guys.
323.8,324.8, Yeah.
324.8,326.8, Women are so shallow.
326.8,328.8, Hmm.
328.8,330.8, It's a week of say that there's nobody.
330.8,331.8, No females.
331.8,332.8, Some of this podcast.
332.8,333.8, They're probably one or two.
333.8,334.8, You think?
334.8,335.8, Probably.
335.8,336.8, Do anything.
336.8,339.8," If you're female, I knew listen to this podcast."
339.8,341.8, Start starting in dignet forums.
341.8,344.8," Send me a personally, male."
344.8,350.8," If you're female and you listen to this podcast, I'm sorry."
350.8,351.8, Sorry.
351.8,352.8, Just to follow.
352.8,355.8, Robert Apodas is on behalf of all men.
355.8,357.8, Do we have anything to talk about this week?
357.8,359.8, We're just going to ramble.
359.8,360.8, Plenty of games.
360.8,361.8, We have talk about the game.
361.8,363.8, What we're doing talking about weight.
363.8,364.8," Yeah, Sean's like an off the skusted."
364.8,366.8, He's going to rip off his mic.
366.8,367.8, Wait.
367.8,368.8, Wait.
368.8,369.8, Wait.
369.8,370.8, Wait.
370.8,374.8, Can I point out though that you've made a very strong policy over all the time.
374.8,379.8," If none of you, and how many years that is now, of never wearing."
379.8,380.8, Never wearing.
380.8,384.8," You know, one day he said like, this body is not for sale."
384.8,385.8, I didn't say like that.
385.8,386.8, Yeah.
386.8,387.8, Yeah.
387.8,389.8, And that's what I was trying to pay you.
389.8,392.8, And today you were in a team for just two shirt.
392.8,393.8, What's that about?
393.8,394.8, I got it.
394.8,395.8, I got it.
395.8,397.8, One of the few game shirts I've ever worn.
397.8,402.2," You know, the usually what happens when you visit a studio or something or a studio visits"
402.2,403.8," us here, they'll bring a shirt or so."
403.8,405.8, Hence the joke about certain people.
405.8,408.8," You know, in the industry who's closets are filled with nothing button."
408.8,410.8, A different game shirt for each day of the week.
410.8,411.8, That is a cool shirt.
411.8,413.8," And I tried to, yes, I tried not to rock name brands."
413.8,414.8, That's how I said it.
414.8,417.8, I didn't say this body is not for sale.
417.8,419.8, I tried not to build board.
419.8,421.8," So if you talk about it, I'm pre-empting you."
421.8,422.8, If we talk about team for two.
422.8,423.8," Because on the side, look at there's nothing."
423.8,424.8, It doesn't say anything.
424.8,426.8, There's just a nice illustration.
426.8,427.8, Nice illustration.
427.8,429.8, Now look at the full shirt even if you didn't know.
429.8,434.8, But I like that you picked the spy one because I can tell you picked it not because of
434.8,437.8," its aesthetic qualities, but because you identify as a spy."
437.8,438.8, So I am.
438.8,443.8," That's how that's how a whole part of picking those classes and how, you know, like people,"
443.8,445.8," you know, usually refer people to our magazine."
445.8,450.8, But I hope they do get to read the the verses in story and the current issue.
450.8,453.8, That's the issue with borderlands and brothers norms on it.
453.8,454.8, Because we have some fun.
454.8,457.8, I'll now talk in about 499.
457.8,459.8, What sorts of people pick each class?
459.8,460.8, Yep.
460.8,461.8, Yeah.
461.8,465.8," So if we talk about this today, I'm going to feel like, you know, you're talking about it because"
465.8,466.8, Valve gave you that.
466.8,468.8, Gave you the shirt otherwise.
468.8,469.8, Yeah.
469.8,470.8," Because you know, it was crazy."
470.8,473.8," Like if you look back a few weeks ago, I had nothing to say about it."
473.8,476.8," But it'll, if anything, about team foragers too."
476.8,478.8, And as soon as I got the shirt.
478.8,480.8," With this shit on my back, I want to talk."
480.8,481.8, That's why I didn't want to hear about your weight.
481.8,482.8, I don't care.
482.8,483.8, I'll fuck a much away.
483.8,485.8, I got to tell you about how good the spy classes.
485.8,487.8, You've got a t-shirt to say it.
487.8,488.8, I do.
488.8,491.8," No, it's funny because you're not the first to point it out."
491.8,493.8, Everyone's because I make a lot of things.
493.8,496.8, You do make a bunch of shirts are fucking hideous because they are like the ones
496.8,497.8, Ryan usually.
497.8,499.8, They have like a wraparound image.
499.8,500.8, It's the old.
500.8,501.8, It's a right.
501.8,502.8, It's on.
502.8,503.8, It's on.
503.8,504.8, It's on.
504.8,506.8, There's the shirt I got on.
507.8,508.8," That's a game, isn't it?"
508.8,510.8," Yeah, it's a shirt for WTF."
510.8,512.8, We're time for a cool shirt.
512.8,513.8, That's a cool shirt.
513.8,516.8, I'm just impressed that the mic picked up the saddenes.
516.8,517.8, That was awesome.
517.8,520.8," Just for the record, that was a sweatshirt."
520.8,521.8, I know.
521.8,523.8, That's later.
523.8,524.8, That's later.
524.8,526.8, That's for the brain.
526.8,530.8," I thought you're, you're also taking care of the note that you why you're"
530.8,531.8, wearing a sweatshirt.
531.8,532.8, You're not wearing sweatpants.
532.8,535.8, It's just a sign of class.
535.8,536.8, That's a sign of class.
536.8,537.8," I was like,bian."
537.8,539.8," I mean, I knew this kid in high school, where every day he had a different,"
539.8,542.8," what the fuck man was it, Mega Death?"
542.8,544.8," Yeah, he had a different Mega Death."
544.8,545.8," No, a testament."
545.8,547.8, He had a different test plan for every day of the week.
547.8,549.8," And a different color sweatpants, but I was like, you know, grey,"
549.8,552.8," dark grey, grey, maybe to match the different yeah."
552.8,555.8," So, every day of the week it would be as uniform would be a pair of sweatpants"
555.8,557.8, and a testament.
557.8,558.8, Yes.
558.8,561.8," But those those are like the nasty, well, especially,"
561.8,563.8," you know, if you get a shirt and there's like just some big loud"
563.8,568.8, loud graphics and they wrap around the size and it all goes back to the hot topic silks
568.8,572.9599999999999, you know pseudo silk things where you got spider manner Todd McFarland's dragon
572.9599999999999,578.0, kind of reaching around the broad swath of your your hairy back and breathing flames
578.0,579.8, out your other arm.
579.8,582.8, That's dressed to try to.
582.8,583.8, I want to.
583.8,584.8, I want to.
584.8,585.8," No, I think of it."
585.8,586.8, I got what does it say?
586.8,587.8, You're logging camp.
587.8,588.8, Yeah.
588.8,590.8, East Vail logging camp.
590.8,591.8, It's a wild shirt.
591.8,595.8," Oh, I thought that was just like some thrift, the kind of thing you get in a thrift store."
595.8,596.8, I would like.
596.8,598.8," Well, you know, it's just a outer shirt."
598.8,601.8," Actually, that's that's what I'm sure that I'm wearing is from a thrift store."
601.8,606.8," Well, no, nowadays they took that whole thrift store like mindset, you know, kind of like when"
606.8,610.8, when you came popular and you go to Target and have shirts with it's supposed to be ironic
610.8,611.8, prints on.
611.8,612.8," Yeah, yes."
612.8,614.8," The same way you see people wearing like chairman mousher, it's a shit."
614.8,615.8, Right.
615.8,616.8," You know, like to even know what the fuck that is."
616.8,618.8, I think there's nothing ironic or funny about that.
618.8,620.8, Like that's a piece of shit on your shirt.
620.8,621.8, You think it's funny?
621.8,623.8, I totally want to tell people that.
623.8,625.8," You know, and then, oh, I got to Target."
625.8,626.8," He, he, he's funny."
626.8,628.8," Like I got this, I'm sure at the hammering sick one."
628.8,631.8, You should hand in the little red book to really rate this.
631.8,632.8, Yeah.
632.8,634.8," You know, like, to talk about the cultural revolution."
634.8,636.8, I didn't know you're such a fervent anti-communist.
636.8,637.8, Yeah.
637.8,638.8, Did this not anti-communist?
638.8,640.8, Do like to like the Nixon of one up.
640.8,647.8," Although, you're, I'm glad to see you approach politics with the same console"
647.8,648.8, or mentality.
648.8,649.8, Yeah.
649.8,651.8, It gets dictators actually.
651.8,661.3," It killed millions of people with their, I feel like, it was the console war stuff and politics"
661.3,662.3, have a lot in common.
662.3,666.54, Just the way that people approach it and the way that they fight each other about it in ridiculous
666.54,667.54, and stupid ways.
667.54,668.54, I think so.
668.54,669.54, It's kind of right.
669.54,670.54, Yeah.
670.54,674.18," Take a look on any, on any message boards, such as the what is it now?"
674.18,676.78, 10 page thread on one up forms were.
676.78,677.78, Yeah.
677.78,678.78, I really like that.
678.78,684.78, I really do like that now that the PS3 Xbox 360 war is so heated that PC we're just
684.78,685.78, kind of out of it.
685.78,690.02, It used to be kind of like PC versus console in general and that's still around.
690.02,693.42, But the bigger war definitely to me feels like it's those two consoles.
693.42,694.42, Right.
694.42,698.02, I think those people can't get along with the Wii coming in there or two at times.
698.02,700.02, It's very nice to be.
700.02,701.02, We're just sort of on the side.
701.02,703.02," Oh, it's kind of laughing at everyone."
703.02,705.54," Because we'll play, we'll play console."
705.54,706.54, It seems weird.
706.54,710.8199999999999," I know there are people who just play PC and play PC exclusively, but it always seems"
710.8199999999999,715.98," such an easy move to say, hey, there is an entire variety of game experiences of"
715.98,721.3, a long consoles that you can't get on PC and get a console and play those too.
721.3,723.06, But we don't see so much of that.
723.06,724.3, We used to have the internal thing.
724.3,727.2199999999999, Is it AMD or Intel or I'm an ATI or an Nvidia.
727.2199999999999,732.4599999999999," There's people always find some point of difference to identify themselves with, and to build"
732.4599999999999,734.4599999999999, identity around.
734.62,737.3000000000001," The chat, I mean, like Robert, you were in this thread."
737.3000000000001,739.22," Well, it wasn't just one thread."
739.22,741.22," For some reason this week, I don't know."
741.22,744.46, You ever have one of those days where you look at the message boards.
744.46,749.1," And after about 10 minutes, you're about to have a fucking heart attack from all the stupidity"
749.1,750.1, on your way.
750.1,751.74, That's known as rage stroke.
751.74,752.74, Yeah.
752.74,754.46, Something about reviews this week.
754.46,761.22," People just freaked out, specifically ratchet and clank for PlayStation 3 of all things."
761.3000000000001,765.6600000000001," But because of all things, because it's an exclusive platform exclusive game."
765.6600000000001,771.1800000000001," Yeah, but I just from a best-selling series, you know, and it's rightfully regarded,"
771.1800000000001,774.6600000000001," you know, it's being, it's being Apple's at the little first one and I loved it."
774.6600000000001,778.46," But the fact that it's a Sony exclusive, I think, has something to do with."
778.46,782.74," Yeah, well, but people were freaking out over an 8.5, I guess."
782.74,784.26, Which is phenomenal score.
784.26,785.26, That's being out too.
785.26,786.46," That's being, yeah, way too low."
786.46,787.3000000000001, Really?
787.3000000000001,789.1," Way to, you know, art score, one up that comment."
789.1,790.1," Yeah, yeah."
790.1,794.4200000000001," And then I guess a game's book, give it a 7.5 and that sent people into some sort of"
794.4200000000001,795.4200000000001, death spiral.
795.4200000000001,796.4200000000001, Yeah.
796.4200000000001,798.14," So you decide, watch on, but I'll put it on."
798.14,799.14, Yeah.
799.14,800.14, Awesome.
800.14,804.78," But I just don't understand why people develop these like hardcore pre-perceptions,"
804.78,807.38, pre-conceptions of what a game is going to be like.
807.38,812.5," So without having a read these reviews or this thread, let me guess, people felt we scored"
812.5,815.1, it low because we're anti-somely biased.
815.1,816.1," Yeah, a lot of people."
816.1,817.1, Probably some of that.
817.1,818.1," Yeah, a lot of people."
818.1,824.7," But a lot of it was just, you know, rage about, you know, this review doesn't get it or"
824.7,827.7, why didn't they post one of the higher reviews from EGM or blah blah.
827.7,829.5, Who reviewed it?
829.5,831.5, Who was the one up review?
831.5,834.1800000000001, Do we believe that was my follow it?
834.1800000000001,835.5400000000001," Joe, were you back in that one?"
835.5400000000001,836.5400000000001, I think you're right.
836.5400000000001,837.5400000000001," Yeah, that's right."
837.5400000000001,839.1, Who used to work for a official PlayStation Max.
839.1,840.1," Oh, yeah, that kind of know."
840.1,842.4200000000001," Yeah, he's a really, he's a really anti-somely."
842.4200000000001,843.4200000000001, Yeah.
843.4200000000001,844.4200000000001, Yeah.
844.4200000000001,846.7," And if you, yeah, I do believe, you know, not saying one way or the other."
846.7,852.1," I mean, he has a record for being, especially fun of games for Sony systems."
852.1,858.1," I mean, if you do look at, you know, I'm comparing like the OPM scores to EGM scores or"
858.1,860.7, like directly any GM when you have all three of them.
860.7,864.5400000000001," I mean, as I recall, he would, you know, very often be the one to give the highest score."
864.5400000000001,866.3000000000001, He has a Sony tattoo on his ass.
866.3000000000001,867.7, But I'm not saying that one.
867.7,868.7, Not for you.
868.7,869.7, Is that for you?
869.7,870.7, No.
870.7,871.7," Yeah, I've seen it."
871.7,874.7," I'm just a make a, I just snorted for it."
874.7,877.7, I'm just trying to tell where the circle of the X.
877.7,878.7," Oh, yeah."
878.7,879.7, I don't know.
879.7,888.1, I just get really frustrated when I imagine that the audience doesn't really like give a shit about anything
888.1,890.7," you're writing, that all they care about is the number."
890.7,891.7, Validating.
891.7,892.7, Yeah.
892.7,893.7, What was going to happen?
893.7,897.7, You could bring up any of the points in the texture where they was all just focused on the number.
897.7,900.7," I mean, a few people were, and there was definitely some fighting in the thread from"
900.7,902.7, people who were thinking that it was ridiculous.
902.7,904.7," It was just a lot of, you know, freaking out over the number."
904.7,911.7," And the gaff thread was, if somebody posted like an EGM score thread, and that was the ultimate sort of if you want to."
911.7,915.7," It had, you have W scores too, but let's point out that no one even gives shit."
915.7,917.7, No one said a word about our scores.
917.7,919.7, That's because our scores were just perfect.
919.7,920.7, That was not that.
920.7,925.7," And I think the, the people, the conversation is really coming from the points of contention, you know,"
925.7,930.7," and it's like they go in and you say, there's, and of course, it was just the scores."
930.7,932.7," You know, there was no text to accompany it."
932.7,934.7," And you, and they go in and say, these are good scores."
934.7,935.7, Or these are bad scores.
935.7,939.7," And you know, that doesn't mean, hey, an 8.5, that's a, that's a good score as an"
939.7,940.7, positive score.
940.7,942.7," That's, that's a high score."
942.7,944.7," What that means is, I approve of this score."
944.7,945.7, Or I don't approve of it.
945.7,950.7," And it almost all instances, these are scores for games that are available to the public."
950.7,951.7, So right.
951.7,956.7, How they're determining whether or not they approve of the scores is a mystery.
956.7,957.7, Right.
957.7,958.7, Yeah.
958.7,962.7," And it's a good part of the mystery we're trying to get to, you know, we're trying to resolve right now."
962.7,967.7," And just, yeah, then, but as a sideline, more, that stuff is, it's just there."
967.7,971.7," It's, you know, it's kind of one of the things in life you shake your head out and say, wow."
971.7,974.7," But they've, they've opened up these discussions that are more interesting."
974.7,976.7," I think on, thanks, Ryan."
976.7,980.7, On the nature of reviews and what people expect from reviews.
980.7,983.7," And I think there's more to be said there because it's not us to sort of, you know,"
983.7,988.7," what, what, and our finger and stick in it in the year and trying to figure out why people act."
988.7,991.7," I don't know, why people sound like they're ready to fight."
991.7,996.7," They're ready to fight you over, you know, parking lot of the, the Raiders' Coliseum over."
996.7,997.7, Yeah.
997.7,1000.7," It's one thing, it's one thing if you're the developer, right?"
1000.7,1001.7, And you're pissed.
1001.7,1003.7, And you have a vested interest in their view.
1003.7,1009.7," But it is incredible to see people get so angry about our view that, why do they care so much?"
1009.7,1010.7, Right.
1010.7,1012.7, And especially if they haven't played the game yet.
1012.7,1014.7," Yeah, that's a kind of a weird thing."
1014.7,1016.7, They're like validating your system.
1016.7,1017.7, Yeah.
1017.7,1019.7," Well, when it's when this fanboy is involved, it's obvious."
1019.7,1026.7, It's just like an 8.5 or whatever you perceive as low is obviously a blow against the system that you're supporting no matter what.
1026.7,1031.7, It's damaging your system and ruining its chances in this horrible horrible console war that's going on.
1031.7,1033.7," So that's, that's where that comes from."
1033.7,1034.7, If it is right.
1034.7,1038.7," But I often wonder, do reviews even really have that big of an impact on sales,"
1038.7,1042.7, especially like a one up dot com review of a game is that people argue that they do.
1042.7,1044.7," Hey, I'll point out again."
1044.7,1048.7," Like if reviews, if review scores or whatever, if limit sales,"
1048.7,1050.7, the games like like psychonauts or whatever.
1050.7,1051.7, Right.
1051.7,1053.7, And then much more popular.
1053.7,1054.7," Oh, comedy, what a solid beginning."
1054.7,1055.7, I'm sure.
1055.7,1060.7," At the same time, though, it's hard to say again, their game is like bio shark or something."
1060.7,1066.7," And you could sort of want to think that the uniformly positive, glowing reviews might have contributed that."
1066.7,1072.7," But I think what's more though is just the discussion word of mouth people telling friends, you know, what's going on now."
1072.7,1077.7, Or they don't even ask it's unsolicited when someone comes to you and starts talking about a game.
1077.7,1080.7," And you haven't even asked them say, hey, tell me something to play this week."
1080.7,1083.7," Then it's just contagious. You say, oh, okay, I want to play that, you know,"
1083.7,1089.7, or you go online and every other thread is about bio shark or every other thread is about whatever portal.
1089.7,1092.7," Then you then you just say, I, hey, I want to get in on it."
1092.7,1093.7," So I think that yeah, the review scores no matter."
1093.7,1101.7," We know that they matter to an extraordinary extent to PR people and publishers, right?"
1101.7,1106.7," And they're just actively doing everything they can to get the highest job critic high score, you know,"
1106.7,1111.7," recommending to reviews editors who should review the game, what the qualifications are."
1111.7,1122.7, But this is completely tied into certain facts like that the PR people themselves will get bonuses based on how the game does on a site like Metacritic.
1122.7,1124.7," Right, many not all of them. So we're not all."
1124.7,1130.7, But it's not a blank any publishers PR teams do receive bonuses based on the Metacritic score for the game.
1130.7,1136.7," We've talked about that before we said it's insane because it, this assumption there is that the PR person is influencing the score."
1136.7,1140.7," Because it's like if it's a reward, you have to be rewarded for something you did."
1140.7,1144.7," Well, of course, we don't want to think that they had anything to do with the scores, you know, and of course,"
1144.7,1147.7," when they recommend who reviews things, we just ignore that."
1147.7,1152.7, A side effect of that is a lot of people talk about how we want a fair review.
1152.7,1153.7, We want the best review.
1153.7,1156.7, We want the review from someone who just loves this series or this game.
1156.7,1160.7," And this is why you always hear this talk about fans of the genre and this and that, you know, in these reviews."
1160.7,1162.7, And think about that for a minute.
1162.7,1169.7, The downside is that your line of thought is entirely in line with the desires of a PR team and a marketing team.
1169.7,1173.7," Because they very much say, hey, get make sure, you know, just do us a favor."
1173.7,1176.7, And make sure whoever reviews this just loves this series.
1176.7,1177.7, They love the last one.
1177.7,1182.7," They love, you know, movies that are similar and content and scope to this thing."
1182.7,1189.7," And so by saying that, you do, for whatever, for better or worse, you want the exact same thing as the marketing team."
1189.7,1195.7," Another thing to keep mind is that if someone reviews the game and they might disagree with you,"
1195.7,1198.7, I don't think that that should be threatening to you.
1198.7,1210.7," Personally, don't believe we should look at reviews and say this had better confirm, you know, this had better be provide further ammunition for me in the arguments I have online with other people that don't agree with me."
1210.7,1214.7," So I can say, well, look, guys, if you agree with me, what do you say about that?"
1214.7,1216.7," Well, what if we totally disagree with you?"
1216.7,1226.7," But we make it very clear why we disagree with you and in reading that and listening to that, you can say, hey, at least I understand their point of view."
1226.7,1231.7," Kind of like arguing with the spouse or something, you know, it's like, hey, we agreed to disagree, but I at least understand where that's coming from."
1231.7,1241.7," But then you also know, by reading that, you know, we often talk about the difference between consumer important critique, but I think a good critique will have a recommendation implicit in it."
1241.7,1247.7," In the same way that if, you know, if you're really thinking through something and talking about it and you're, you know, you're engaging it thoroughly."
1247.7,1253.7," It's going, you're going to read it and say, hey, if this person's point of view seems similar to my own,"
1254.7,1259.7," it's going to recommend itself to you, you know, and that's like a critic in any any entertainment form."
1259.7,1268.7," Exactly exactly, that's the thing is like this whole notion that games, there's always this talk, what's the game, what's what's the game journalism be or what should, you know, in this case, it's criticism."
1268.7,1271.7," The two are very different journalism is not, you know, revealing, right."
1271.7,1276.7," What should it be and I don't, it's kind of puzzling to me at times when we have these big, you know,"
1277.7,1284.7," these chin stroking discussions on them because it's like, well, why don't we ever just look at what works elsewhere and maybe, and I think it does work the same."
1284.7,1293.7," I don't think we have to rewrite the playbook, you know, and instead of just writing these lists of, you know, here's a list of good things and here's a list of bad things about the movie."
1293.7,1297.7," A good movie reviews never like that, you know, game reviews are almost always like that."
1297.7,1304.7," And the differences is those, those are worthwhile, I think if someone says, hey, this is hot, this is hot, this is not, and then those would be, you know,"
1304.7,1306.7, the graphics compelling gameplay.
1306.7,1312.7," These are all, and these are all, you know, cliches, I want to come back to that in a minute because I have something to say about that."
1312.7,1322.7," But these are things that your friends can tell you. These are things that you can find on message boards, or just, you go to a game specific thread and it's going to be full of these items, you know."
1322.7,1330.7," But I think, on the other hand, if you're a reviewer and you can put together some sort of like coherent, you know, something that represents a coherent thought process with, you know,"
1330.7,1340.7," of a thesis almost, you know, we're like here, here, I'm going to focus on some aspect of this game and then explain to playing it and put it together in such a way that when you read it, you think differently about the game, you know,"
1340.7,1355.7," and then I'll tell you a world changing stuff here, but you'll let's, you appreciate some other way, and again, if you disagree, it doesn't matter because, you know, if you could still buy it, if you heard 16,000 other people tell you this game is incredible and you trust them more than go do it,"
1355.7,1361.7," but then maybe I can tell you, maybe I can get you to think about it in some other other way, so you at least when you talk about it."
1361.7,1364.7," And you'll understand your own point of view more, too, by the contrast."
1364.7,1370.7," I'd actually rather see a, other forms of entertainment being right there reviews more like game reviews."
1370.7,1377.7," I'd like to see the New York Times have movie reviews with like a pro-cons thing at the end, you know, pros, good, great."
1377.7,1379.7," Yeah, excellent lighting."
1380.7,1395.7," I don't know, I think a long lens of a shons thing, like a really great review should be this kind of starting point for a conversation between the audience and the, and the writer and the people writing and posting on message boards and talking to each other."
1395.7,1406.7," It shouldn't be this like from a pie, I think a lot of people negatively react to scores because they get the sense that it's somebody who's had the opportunity to play the game for anyone else and they get to say,"
1406.7,1419.7," this game sucks and it, you know, it feels very like authoritarian, whereas a great review should feel more like someone coming up with insightful things to talk about and inspire other people to talk about the game."
1419.7,1420.7, Exactly.
1420.7,1421.7, Exactly.
1421.7,1426.7, I'm the final word on this and it's absurd that some people still think that they're ever in a position to do that.
1426.7,1430.7, And the sad thing is I think that all the semifzists on scores just makes reviews worse.
1430.7,1436.7," I mean, it's not like everyone shouldn't kidn admit, I think the game reviews are not fantastic right now."
1436.7,1446.7," People are trying, but you know, they're definitely failings and there isn't much room to experiment though because the audience is so focused on scores that if you, that if you go off on a tangent,"
1446.7,1456.7," all in the score doesn't match up with what they're saying, then they're just going to freak out that you haven't gone through all the pros and the cons, all the bullshit that you have to cover your ass with,"
1456.7,1460.7, to make sure that you've done and appropriate reviews.
1460.7,1470.7," They can never do anything interesting without it's, you know, I actually had sort of like a post review discussion with someone at EA, they wanted to get my perspective on Melavon or airborne."
1470.7,1476.7," And this is not a case of them challenging my review or anything, but they just wanted to supplement their understanding of it."
1476.7,1483.7," And what was funny is they looked at every line I could tell and it started to seem clear that they're like, what you talked about this or that, you know,"
1483.7,1490.7," and I was like, wait a minute, are you reading this in relation to the score where every single negative sentence is like, okay, so if a game is like,"
1490.7,1495.7," hypothetically, this isn't Melavon or any more benefit game is a eight."
1495.7,1501.7," And there's only two comments that are explicitly negative, then each one of those must cost a point or something."
1501.7,1509.7," Maybe if they look hard enough to find eight positive things, you said, I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, because we're back out of that for a minute, you know, and then,"
1509.7,1513.7," where there's numbers, there's math, and I do math, that's where it's crazy."
1513.7,1515.7, That's what people are imagining.
1515.7,1522.7," One thing I do with like movie reviews or book reviews that I noticed I do less frequently with game reviews is if I've already played, I mean,"
1522.7,1526.7," scene of movie or read a book, I will seek out reviews after that."
1526.7,1527.7," Yeah, right."
1527.7,1530.7," Which I don't necessarily do with much frequency with games, like if I was."
1530.7,1531.7, Right.
1531.7,1532.7, Because we're still immersed in games.
1532.7,1536.7," Well, but also because it has, because they lack the insight that you're talking about,"
1537.7,1540.7," like you would go back and I agree with you, Sean, that's what I do."
1540.7,1548.7," Like I'll go back and read a book review of a book I really like say, because I'm hoping that they're going to articulate maybe better than I could think in my own head."
1548.7,1550.7, Why I actually liked it.
1550.7,1551.7, Right.
1551.7,1552.7, Or what I do.
1552.7,1558.7, The very best ones will come out of left field and the hits you with possibilities of initiating the movie in ways that you hadn't even crossed your mind.
1558.7,1559.7, Right.
1559.7,1564.7," I want to give a shout out to one movie critic who I really love, who's Michael Sal at the San Francisco Chronicle."
1564.7,1571.7, I have to say I used to hate this guy because he would quite often like totally dismiss movies that I thought were awesome like the matrix.
1571.7,1575.7," But then I realized over time like then I like then I realized so at first I was like,"
1575.7,1579.7, Any review that Michael said any movie he likes I hate.
1579.7,1584.7," Yeah, that was my first take, but then he would write one and it would be an awesome review of a movie I like."
1584.7,1586.7," So I'm like, oh shit, I can't predict this guy's taste."
1586.7,1593.7," And then after a while I realized, no, he just writes what he thinks every time and he doesn't give a fuck what the popular, you know,"
1593.7,1597.7, whatever way you can tell they're supposed to feel about a movie.
1597.7,1601.7, But in every case he always makes me think about it.
1601.7,1606.7, Like I can totally disagree with him and it'll piss me off that he's not validating my opinion.
1606.7,1611.7," But even if he hates it, he'll there will always be at least two or three points where I go,"
1611.7,1614.7, Ah fuck in the review like he's right.
1614.7,1615.7, Yeah.
1615.7,1616.7, It did do that.
1616.7,1617.7, Yeah.
1617.7,1621.7," There's this thing about, you know, when you watch a great movie, you read a book that you're really into."
1621.7,1623.7," After you're done with it, it doesn't leave your head."
1623.7,1628.7, And so I'm always going when that happens to me to look at reviews and people talking about it.
1628.7,1632.7, And it's a way to like further your enjoyment of it and continue to think about it.
1632.7,1636.7, Keep your head in that space and how often do we ever do that in our own history?
1636.7,1637.7, I do it.
1637.7,1638.7, I do it.
1638.7,1642.7, I try at least all the time when you play something and you know your first reaction is always like emotional level.
1642.7,1644.7, This was great or this was bad.
1644.7,1645.7, And then we'll why though.
1645.7,1647.7," I mean, trying to figure out why."
1647.7,1649.7, And here's to go back to the cliche thing I think I'm going to bring it back now.
1649.7,1654.7," I mean, we we we you can make fun of the language that reviews are written in all you want."
1654.7,1656.7," Ultimately, I don't think it's that important."
1656.7,1665.7," So, but I think what's the problem the problem with the clichés and stuff is that they're indicative of of a mindset that that operates within the confines of clichés."
1665.7,1669.7," And so that's the difference between someone saying something interesting or saying, you know what they say."
1669.7,1670.7, This is compelling or something.
1670.7,1672.7," You know, you say that so many times."
1672.7,1674.7," And if you look around that specific word for example,"
1674.7,1678.7," at it now in the past few months, that's the equivalent of good or whatever."
1678.7,1679.7, Compatible and you'll see it.
1679.7,1680.7," Yeah, you'll see over and over again."
1680.7,1687.7, Do some do some work out there and you'll see to the point where I don't think you'll ever look at the word the same way.
1687.7,1694.7," But the problem then is, you know, when you look at the game and you're like, okay, I'm just and you're just evaluating it by this boiler plate."
1694.7,1698.7," You know, checklist, you know, this this really simplistic rubric of does it do this?"
1698.7,1699.7, Does it do this?
1699.7,1701.7, And you're not even really aware of your own.
1701.7,1704.7, You're not even aware of how your criticisms tune.
1704.7,1709.7," It's just like, I mean, you should really stop and think, what is it that I like about games or something?"
1709.7,1714.7, And this is the other subject of this is the difference between subjective reviews.
1714.7,1720.7," And then this this chimera, this like illusion of the objective review that you see a lot of people talk about."
1720.7,1722.7," This came up in the threads as well, you know, and it's like, well,"
1722.7,1726.7," X next website does the objective reviews and you know, it's fine."
1726.7,1729.7, It's just different strokes for different folks and you do the subjective ones.
1729.7,1743.7," And I was rather say, no, you're you're blowing smoke up your own ass and as well as your audiences ask when you even say there's such a thing as an objective evaluation of a word of a piece of entertainment."
1743.7,1751.7," Tell me, like, thank you for example of an objective and yet a value of statement that you can make that about a video game interview."
1751.7,1753.7, That's ultimately going to be helpful.
1753.7,1757.7," So if you were to say, the graphics look great, that's a subjective statement."
1758.7,1769.7," The notion of what looks good is going to differ to everyone if you're used to playing, you know, say if someone just got done spending week playing crisis and they're they move over and they play, you know, whatever unreal or something."
1769.7,1775.7," Or the other guy just got done reviewing, you know, some game that doesn't look anywhere near as good as you."
1775.7,1782.7," I mean, there are frames, you're perspective is always going to be influenced by the things that, you know, are going into it."
1782.7,1796.7," It's all about those cliches you're just talking about, I mean, all the things that we've talked about in video game since magazines in the 80s graphics game play, AI, these sort of bullet points that we hit on all the time."
1796.7,1806.7," They've been around for so long that I think a lot of people come to think of them as objective, simple things that you can evaluate that anyone can evaluate."
1806.7,1815.7," And it happens all the time that people are you over it like AI is something that people are you about all the time because how the fuck do you say, you know, this is good AI or bad AI."
1815.7,1821.7, There are a few statements that you can make that are objective that some people would take.
1821.7,1827.7," It's like it has six it works in 60 frames per second to someone like that might be a value to a statement is like, right."
1827.7,1829.7," Yeah, that's really, really. Right. Right."
1829.7,1830.7, Or the resolution.
1830.7,1835.7, You don't have that with books in movies. You never hear those kind of fact.
1835.7,1837.7," Well, it has 48 pages."
1837.7,1841.7, I think they don't be don't have it because they're on the same technical problems.
1841.7,1842.7, Right. Right.
1842.7,1843.7, We're not watching that with that.
1843.7,1845.7," Yeah, you don't watch a movie and say it's all in focus."
1845.7,1846.7, Yeah. Exactly.
1846.7,1854.7," Some people also about subjectivity which scares people is that you assume, oh, it's kind of like, you know, moral relativism or something."
1854.7,1859.7, That means everything flies. That means you can go and be a Hitler or you can be a mal and do whatever.
1859.7,1865.7," It's in the games. It's like, well, that means someone's going to say that, you know, what's a piece of shit game."
1865.7,1868.7, What's our red rock? What's red rock arts? Yes.
1868.7,1869.7, The greatest game ever.
1869.7,1874.7," But the thing is we all as people even though we have differences, we have a lot more."
1874.7,1877.7, We all have a lot more in common with one another and our taste.
1877.7,1879.7," Then we ever have, you know, a part."
1880.7,1883.7," Then we ever have a, you know, a difference in opinion."
1883.7,1888.7," And that just keeps things in this framework, you know. So there's a discussion of good AI and bad AI."
1888.7,1890.7, It's a really narrow window you're talking about here.
1890.7,1895.7," It's not like someone's going to come out and say, well, the AI and pack man's the most impressive thing I've ever seen."
1895.7,1900.7," And then say that it's like non-existent in whatever, you know, in Halo or something."
1900.7,1906.7," But the other thing is if you take, if you have pretensions of objectiveism in reviews specifically,"
1907.7,1910.7," or not objectivism, sorry, objectivity, very different."
1910.7,1912.7, And there's a connection with it.
1912.7,1914.7, There's my bio chakra.
1914.7,1915.7, Another one.
1915.7,1918.7, And you try to dress it up in this newter sterile language.
1918.7,1923.7," And you can convince, you could do some people into thinking that, oh,"
1923.7,1928.7," if you sound like Star Trek's data, then you're being objective."
1928.7,1931.7, We have scientifically calculated that this game is an 8.8.
1931.7,1932.7, Right.
1932.7,1938.7," Yeah. Like hey, data, I heard you lost your virginity last night in the under a full moon."
1938.7,1939.7, What was that like?
1939.7,1943.7," Well, the unit, the male unit entered the female unit at this,"
1943.7,1946.7," oh, point in time, 17.8 seconds."
1946.7,1949.7," And it's like, this again gets me hot over here."
1949.7,1955.7," Yeah, this, for one again, these are, you know, this is, this might seem like an over,"
1955.7,1957.7, a really academic discussion.
1957.7,1959.7," And ultimately, they just want to say, hey, but these are games."
1959.7,1960.7, They're supposed to be fun.
1960.7,1963.7," And that's what we're talking about fun, but why things are fun, you know?"
1963.7,1964.7, Yeah.
1964.7,1968.7, And there's no objective answer for why things are fun.
1968.7,1971.7," So I challenge anyone that really thinks that, you know,"
1971.7,1974.7," and I know who some of the proponents of that are, you know, like over game spawn stuff,"
1974.7,1979.7, think that they were honestly believed that they do objective reviews.
1979.7,1983.7," And that's maybe that's a debate we could have on some of the third party form,"
1983.7,1984.7, a gamma suture.
1984.7,1987.7," I'd love to, I'd love to argue it though."
1987.7,1991.7, But I think it also comes from that dichotomy of the fact that there are games out there.
1991.7,1997.7," Now that are pretty unknowable vague things that are pretty hard to quantify,"
1997.7,2003.7, whereas there are still plenty of games that aren't very story-centric that are kind of old school
2003.7,2009.7," that you can just point out and say, you know, this is a product, like a Coke or a bag of chips"
2009.7,2011.7, that was made for the specific purpose.
2011.7,2015.7, And I think because games are so many different things there.
2015.7,2021.7," So the Ryan harder to, yeah, there's some conflict there."
2021.7,2025.7," Between, you know, Bioshawk and Pac-Man."
2025.7,2027.7," Anyway, since?"
2027.7,2034.7," Anyway, on the same pack, so pack me, pack me this fucking awesome and pack me in,"
2034.7,2036.7, Ryan just won't do it.
2036.7,2039.7," Yeah, I think I'm also to noise there."
2039.7,2042.7, I'll put yourself together in their man's.
2042.7,2044.7, If you're a microphone up.
2044.7,2045.7, Yeah.
2045.7,2049.7," Ryan's taking, I mean, Robert's taking a cookie break there, Ryan."
2049.7,2052.7, Just let your sludge him chew for a moment.
2052.7,2055.7," It's good, yeah. Okay, now he's from talking."
2055.7,2058.7, So were you saying Pac-Man has bad AI?
2058.7,2061.7," Oh, it's not AI."
2061.7,2064.7, But neither is what we call AI.
2064.7,2069.7," If you want to go to that direction, what we call AI in video games is not really artificial intelligence."
2069.7,2071.7, Let's talk about the mall.
2071.7,2072.7, The mall.
2072.7,2077.7, I had actually one last thing just back about when we were talking about the console thing.
2077.7,2079.7," It's just, this is an all point."
2079.7,2085.7," But the thing that bothers me when I see all the 360 versus PS3 stuff or whatever,"
2085.7,2089.7," it's like, if you take one step back out of this industry,"
2089.7,2092.7, nobody else in the whole world even knows what you're talking about.
2092.7,2095.7, You're all just like loser geeks to everybody else.
2095.7,2099.7," It's so to me, it feels so much like a dividing conquer."
2099.7,2101.7, And mine's better than yours.
2101.7,2107.7, It's like ants fighting on an ant hill and then a big foot just going to come down and kill them all.
2107.7,2108.7, Right.
2108.7,2109.7, You're all just guling.
2109.7,2110.7, You're all just guling.
2110.7,2113.7," I'm just going to put perspective on anything we do,"
2113.7,2115.7, then it looks kind of bad.
2115.7,2118.7," Yes, yes."
2118.7,2123.7," I mean, I think of all the people in my life who don't know the difference between who still think I make games."
2123.7,2128.7," You know, for the PlayStation, what is that job you do?"
2128.7,2130.7, Do you work on the Wii?
2130.7,2131.7," You know, they don't know anything."
2131.7,2135.7," So what, you know, listening, you know, they would have no clue what you're talking about."
2135.7,2137.7, That one game system means more than another.
2137.7,2140.7," I mean, but I do feel like, I mean, that's a mundane point,"
2140.7,2147.7," but I do feel like it's tied into the idea of these reviews that we can't ever get past this like rubric of,"
2147.7,2150.7," you know, of data points to look at."
2150.7,2157.7," Rather than being able to experience something as an art form and just take it for what it is, not focus on technical details."
2157.7,2160.7," Don't platform details, whatever."
2160.7,2164.7," I mean, like, like, to me, portals the most recent game that was just a phenomenon,"
2164.7,2172.7, like it was so great that everyone could just stop arguing for for 10 minutes and not give a shit about what platform it was on.
2172.7,2175.7," Not really give a shit while some people would give a shit about how long it was,"
2175.7,2178.7," but for the most part, everyone was just like, wow, that was awesome."
2178.7,2181.7," Like, then it just became why is portal awesome?"
2181.7,2186.7," And describing what was awesome about portal rather than just going through this thing,"
2186.7,2192.7," like proving why PC is great or proving why mouse keyboard is great or whatever everyone could just go,"
2192.7,2199.7," wow, we as gamers have this shared experience of this fucking amazing new thing coming in our life and let's talk about it."
2199.7,2205.7," I think that's the deal. Like, okay, game developers just make a whole lot more portal-like games,"
2205.7,2207.7, and then we'll all shut the fuck up.
2207.7,2210.7, There's Robert's solution. Yes. Please.
2210.7,2212.7, Make more portal. I'll take one next week.
2212.7,2218.7," Here's something about this subjectivity thing, like about, um, this is connected to portal, where, uh,"
2218.7,2223.7," saying something, it's like, you shouldn't be blab, I don't believe you should be blabbing about yourself,"
2223.7,2228.7," but at some point, it makes sense to put the cards on the table, so to speak and say,"
2228.7,2232.7, here are some of key things that inform my perspective.
2232.7,2236.7," And, um, and so when you read this, you know, it's worth keeping this in mind."
2236.7,2242.7," And now already, I find that the orange box games are already changing my perspective in that when I look at,"
2242.7,2249.7," when I play other games, I'm looking at them through a lens that's been modified by having played portal, you know."
2249.7,2253.7," So, that's a name names, but the length thing, you get to other games,"
2253.7,2258.7," and as soon as you find big sections and you realize that they're actually diminishing the quality of the overall game,"
2258.7,2261.7," yeah, I'm just like, wow, why didn't they just cut this out?"
2261.7,2265.7," You know, and it's like, and you really start to see, like,"
2265.7,2268.7," sometimes less is more, not not the game is need to be that length,"
2268.7,2271.7," but even if it's a difference between say a seven hour and eight hour games,"
2271.7,2275.7," sometimes having a bad hour, it's very much, you know, like cinema again,"
2275.7,2279.7," there would be a direct-your-scut, maybe there's like five versions of a apocalypse, you know."
2279.7,2284.7," And if you see the wrong one first, your whole notion of it will be changed differently,"
2284.7,2288.7," even though the great parts are still great, the bad parts, like,"
2288.7,2291.7," yeah, bring it down, bring it down sometimes, you're like, wow,"
2291.7,2293.7, now I know why they cut out all that shit.
2293.7,2299.7," Yeah, yeah, and in fact, last week and we rented the first born movie,"
2299.7,2304.7," born identity, I guess, and I put the DVD in and there were two choices."
2304.7,2308.7," It was the extended extra extended edition, didn't say director's cut,"
2308.7,2311.7, actually extended edition and then theatrical release.
2311.7,2315.7," And a warning screen comes up, or not a warning screen, and in post screen, whatever,"
2315.7,2320.7," it comes up before the extra value, extra extended version, what do you pointy"
2320.7,2321.7, get my ugly socks?
2321.7,2324.7," No, and you're like curling your toes in our faces and stuff,"
2324.7,2326.7, Robert's bag of chips.
2326.7,2328.7," I'm done with my chips, okay."
2328.7,2330.7, And you keep your feet up there.
2330.7,2334.7," I'm not offended, Sean's just a total obsessive computer."
2334.7,2336.7," All right, that's gross."
2336.7,2338.7," That's where the, that's true."
2338.7,2341.7, Like I post people like eating feces on the website.
2341.7,2343.7, But I don't watch people do it.
2343.7,2344.7, Like that's what I'm making up.
2344.7,2345.7, Look at it.
2345.7,2347.7," Extra very, very, very clean."
2347.7,2349.7," I bet what you mean, you don't watch people do when it."
2349.7,2353.7, You have sent me the grossest shit I've ever received on the internet.
2353.7,2359.7," I just opened up an I am window and there'd be a link, and then it's some video of a girl"
2359.7,2360.7, taking a dump in a hot tub.
2360.7,2365.7," I know, every come on, every web link from Sean, you have to pause your mouth button and go."
2365.7,2367.7, I really want to come on.
2367.7,2368.7, All right.
2368.7,2370.7, So I was talking about watching the board night.
2370.7,2377.7," Okay, so, yeah, I just want to think that before you start the extra extended thing,"
2377.7,2383.7, there's a disclaimer comes up that says the director had nothing to do with this version.
2383.7,2386.7," You know, and it's with me as exactly what you're talking about."
2386.7,2388.7," It's like, oh man, they just bloated it up."
2388.7,2389.7, Yeah.
2389.7,2391.7," And the director probably said, fuck that."
2391.7,2394.7," I, you know, I edited this movie for a reason."
2394.7,2396.7, So we didn't watch that one.
2396.7,2397.7, Yeah.
2397.7,2403.7," I actually had had a similar experience though, because I finished episode to Half Life and Portal."
2403.7,2409.7, And then went on to go and finish heavenly sword for the PlayStation 3.
2409.7,2412.7," And that came as the worst, just, you know,"
2412.7,2416.7, section after section of stupid shit for you to do.
2416.7,2419.7," Just like, here's eight more guys to slice up."
2419.7,2421.7, Shoot these guys in the head.
2421.7,2425.7," Well, it was just to extend the, yeah, it was like, it was like reverse porn."
2425.7,2430.7," So instead of, instead of having like stupid, you know,"
2430.7,2432.7," story around the money shots, okay."
2432.7,2436.7, They would have this big elaborate story that they spent a lot of money in time on.
2436.7,2440.7," And that I was sort of interested in, but then they'd put you in the game."
2440.7,2448.7," And it would be this insulting, repetitious, just boring thing that you have to do over and over again"
2448.7,2450.7, into the next section.
2450.7,2452.7, That's just because you're a PC guy.
2452.7,2455.7," No money, all porn story."
2455.7,2457.7," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
2457.7,2459.7, And it was really a porn story.
2459.7,2460.7, I'm trading.
2460.7,2463.7," Ah, that's porn, that's forward."
2463.7,2466.7," Yeah, I tried, I tried to finish it."
2466.7,2468.7, I just stopped there.
2468.7,2470.7, There are some sections where you have to run around as the
2470.7,2472.7, Twing Twang Girl.
2472.7,2474.7, I don't know if you guys are playing this at all.
2474.7,2475.7, Shawness.
2475.7,2476.7, No.
2476.7,2477.7, Okay.
2477.7,2481.7, There's a section where you're this character who shoots arrows.
2481.7,2483.7, And at first you start out in your stationary.
2483.7,2486.7, So it's just first person and you're shooting around.
2486.7,2488.7, But then later in the game you start running around.
2488.7,2489.7, She's in having a turn.
2489.7,2490.7, She's a turn.
2490.7,2491.7, So yeah.
2491.7,2492.7, Hold on.
2492.7,2493.7, Hold on.
2493.7,2498.7, But later in the game you have to run around like Resident Evil 4 style and change to an aiming view.
2498.7,2505.7," But with the, sometimes the cameras out of your controls, you'll just sort of run into a corner and hope that you're looking at the right person."
2505.7,2508.7, Turn in the first person mode and then shoot.
2508.7,2514.7," But most of the time when you turn in the first person mode, you're looking at a wall and then you have to swivel around and there's a guy like acting you."
2514.7,2516.7, So you have to go out of third person swivel around.
2516.7,2517.7, Yeah.
2517.7,2518.7, Yeah.
2518.7,2519.7, Go back and hold it.
2519.7,2528.7," And then after you shoot you use the the the six axis thing, which you can turn off whatever, but it's very convoluted and very just insulting."
2528.7,2529.7, Okay.
2529.7,2531.7, You're confirming my suspicion because I had played the demo.
2531.7,2532.7, Yeah.
2532.7,2535.7, So I've got that last four minutes and I decided from that.
2535.7,2537.7, I just did not want any part of this game.
2537.7,2541.7, And I'm a star for PS3 content like every other PS3 owner.
2541.7,2544.7, That's that's strictly for Shane Shane Bettenhausen.
2544.7,2546.7, I came right there.
2546.7,2547.7, I only a shame.
2547.7,2548.7, I could love that game.
2548.7,2549.7, I was just playing.
2549.7,2556.7, I wish I wish that I could just watch the cutscenes because the game had nothing to do with the cutscenes like 90% of the time anyway.
2556.7,2559.7, And I was interested in watching them and they really well done.
2559.7,2561.7, I was like the villain in the game a lot.
2561.7,2566.7, He's I guess he's played by the the golem guy whatever from Lord of the Rings.
2566.7,2567.7, You know this.
2567.7,2569.7," You know, I've watched circus and he's circus."
2569.7,2572.7, Just wife and I wife.
2572.7,2573.7, That's me.
2573.7,2575.7, That's from the end of fucking hallway man.
2575.7,2576.7, I know that's me.
2576.7,2577.7, I called her.
2577.7,2579.7, I called my wife.
2579.7,2580.7, I called my wife.
2580.7,2582.7, I'm sorry.
2582.7,2584.7, How's out.
2584.7,2585.7, I'm such an issue.
2585.7,2587.7, She's just your precious.
2588.7,2589.7, That's right.
2589.7,2591.7, Thanks for the same.
2591.7,2592.7, Yeah.
2592.7,2593.7, My precious.
2593.7,2594.7, That's what I mean.
2594.7,2595.7, It was just a mixed metaphor.
2595.7,2597.7, Sorry honey.
2597.7,2603.7," Yeah, but I wanted to watch the rest of the movies, but you have to play the game to watch the rest of the movies to fuck it."
2603.7,2604.7, You can't just watch.
2604.7,2605.7, You can't get the.
2605.7,2606.7," No, then."
2606.7,2607.7, That's probably a lot.
2607.7,2608.7, Good movies you haven't seen.
2608.7,2609.7, I would recommend one of those.
2609.7,2610.7, Yeah.
2610.7,2612.7, Tell me about that six acts as part of it.
2612.7,2613.7, Because that's interesting.
2613.7,2614.7, What do you.
2614.7,2630.7, You just got you shoot you you aim a little bit with in the first person mode and then when you hold down the button you go into like a slow mode drive the arrow thing which is actually when it's early in the game I found it kind of fun and I like motion control I like we stuff.
2630.7,2631.7, I'm not there's a difference.
2631.7,2643.7, I know there's a difference and and I'm not even opposed to the kinds of games that break from like traditional joystick to some motion control here and there even though I know a lot of people find that annoying and crazy.
2643.7,2656.7, But later on the game it just gets to be ridiculous when you're doing these really elaborate scenes where you got to shoot someone right in the head you know and they're 10 feet away from you and it's just it's just a pain.
2656.7,2657.7, Your guide knit with the.
2657.7,2661.7," Yeah, your guide knit with the motion control you can change it at least the give you the option."
2661.7,2664.7, I feel that that controls the worst thing to happen to be a.
2664.7,2667.7, I mean of all the bad things to happen to be a story that that's probably the worst.
2667.7,2670.7, It's it seems pretty unresponsive compared to the we.
2671.7,2677.7, And just for the fact that it's there and that like instances like where where you know people just feel obligated to something.
2677.7,2682.7, I think you have the past certain hope I do and I've played it for about three or four hours since I bought it.
2682.7,2684.7, I'm hoping the lesson you get every day shooter.
2684.7,2685.7, That's hot.
2685.7,2687.7, I have to that is a good game.
2687.7,2688.7, Do you have that?
2688.7,2690.7, I do not have that get that game.
2690.7,2691.7, Fantastic.
2691.7,2693.7, Johnny we're saying what the lesson learned is what.
2693.7,2694.7," Well, I hope."
2695.7,2701.7, The player has you know the experience of the layer is taught developers that just because it's there doesn't mean you can make it a blague of.
2701.7,2704.7, I hope it's a quickly learned lesson is all.
2704.7,2705.7, Yeah.
2705.7,2709.7, The one one last thing about having this sort it had the ultimate sin.
2709.7,2713.7, It will make you watch a movie section over and over again if you die.
2713.7,2716.7, So even though you see no one and you can't skip it.
2716.7,2717.7, Oh God.
2717.7,2722.7," It's I mean to me it's annoying enough that you can't skip it if you want to anyway, but you can't even skip it after."
2722.7,2725.7," You know, 1000 and seven does that function not make it into a game."
2725.7,2727.7," Yeah, you need to have that."
2727.7,2730.7," That's like that's hubris or like, oh, it's total here."
2730.7,2732.7, Varragance or stupid stupidity.
2732.7,2737.7," I would now knowing what we do speaking with developers here in there, it's got to be it's just vanity."
2737.7,2738.7, Uh-huh.
2738.7,2739.7," Yeah, it made this a lot of watch it."
2739.7,2740.7," But like, I can."
2740.7,2743.7, I think they just want that that was the point of the game.
2743.7,2744.7, It's like why is it the point of the game?
2744.7,2747.7," We paid this CG studio, you know,"
2747.7,2749.7," $400,000 for these."
2749.7,2750.7, Yeah.
2750.7,2754.7," I mean, I mean, I think that you should be able to skip it no matter what, even the first time."
2754.7,2756.7, But there's no excuse after the first time.
2756.7,2758.7," Yes, we watched your great movie."
2758.7,2759.7, Fine.
2759.7,2763.7," We know now that Princess Domassia, you know."
2763.7,2768.7, It has fallen out of the tower and you got to go get it at the crystal.
2768.7,2769.7, Whatever the fuck.
2769.7,2772.7," I think it's the, you got some beef with sprues."
2772.7,2776.7, I think it's the first time you got a beef with sprues.
2776.7,2780.7, You got some beef with sprues.
2780.7,2781.7, You do?
2781.7,2783.7, Like the person or not.
2783.7,2785.7, Peter Parker himself.
2785.7,2786.7, Are you calling him out?
2786.7,2787.7, Yeah.
2787.7,2790.7," Oh, god."
2790.7,2792.7, Do we really want to get into this?
2792.7,2793.7, Yes.
2793.7,2794.7, Tell us.
2794.7,2797.7," Otherwise, I'd just be telling you about the new lef or dead level I played and known as other stuff."
2797.7,2799.7, No one cares about that.
2799.7,2801.7," Hey, you're about Ryan's fight with sprues."
2801.7,2802.7, What do you mean?
2802.7,2803.7, Here we go.
2803.7,2804.7, Let me feed you.
2805.7,2806.7, What's up with spider maddo?
2806.7,2809.7, What the fuck did they do to him this week?
2809.7,2810.7, All right.
2810.7,2817.7," Well, I would just tell him showing about this dumbass story line I've been hearing about in the current spider man comic."
2817.7,2819.7, Which comic?
2819.7,2820.7, I don't know.
2820.7,2824.7, There's like an amazing spider man and just a pen this awesome spider man.
2824.7,2825.7, It's a matter.
2825.7,2827.7, It's a completely retarded spider man.
2827.7,2828.7, It's slightly dickish spider man.
2828.7,2829.7, Yeah.
2830.7,2846.7, There's some huge storyline going on right now that I guess the ending was apparently leaked where spider man's anime gets shot and she gets fresh to the hospital and he doesn't want her to die.
2846.7,2848.7, So he makes a deal with the devil.
2848.7,2851.7," Yeah, Satan with I don't know."
2851.7,2852.7, I don't know.
2852.7,2853.7," Yeah, some reals above."
2853.7,2856.7, He knows he's a real character in a Marvel Universe.
2856.7,2857.7," Yeah, I don't know."
2857.7,2858.7," Yeah, I don't know."
2858.7,2872.7," And so the devil agrees to bring his old Aunt made back to life make make make it sure she doesn't die whatever, but they they alter reality so the spider man never met Mary Jane and got married."
2872.7,2875.7," Oh, that's so the other red cunning."
2875.7,2876.7, Yeah.
2876.7,2878.7, So okay.
2878.7,2882.7," Well, like I said, this is a huge spoiler for two issues that have not come out now."
2882.7,2883.7, So sorry.
2884.7,2885.7, Okay.
2885.7,2888.7, I don't think it's because I said it after the death.
2888.7,2889.7, I said it.
2889.7,2891.7," I said before I launched it, they got leaked."
2891.7,2893.7," So yeah, to the assume."
2893.7,2894.7, That shit is so sad.
2894.7,2898.7," But um, I don't understand what's the point of doing that."
2898.7,2899.7, Like why would they do that?
2899.7,2905.7," Well, I mean, it's basically there business who like dialing spider man back to like where he was you know whenever."
2905.7,2908.7, I think a lot of people complain that when he married going.
2908.7,2911.7, Mary Jane and all went that was when I jumped the charcoal.
2911.7,2912.7," Like well, that's undo that."
2912.7,2913.7, So we're longer jumped the shark.
2913.7,2915.7," There's enough like, I don't know."
2915.7,2917.7, Sharks have been job like that.
2917.7,2920.7," Hey, if it's going home, back over the other way."
2920.7,2921.7, Going in circles.
2921.7,2922.7, I stupid.
2922.7,2925.7, I actually want to read about like spider man in married life.
2925.7,2928.7, That sounds a lot cooler than like the sort of puppy loves to reliance.
2928.7,2929.7, I want to see spider.
2929.7,2930.7, That be cool.
2930.7,2932.7," Come home from work and his wife is like,"
2932.7,2936.7, Can you ever do a single fucking dish right?
2936.7,2940.7, He comes from he's taken off his mask and he's sitting there like all resentful of him.
2941.7,2942.7, Sorry.
2942.7,2944.7, I was just trying to take down Green Goblin.
2944.7,2946.7," You know, you've got important things to do."
2946.7,2947.7," Okay, power great response."
2947.7,2948.7," Oh, that's great."
2948.7,2949.7," Well, meanwhile."
2949.7,2953.7," You know, you know, the lawn could have some of your amazing superpowers."
2953.7,2956.7, There was so much that he bows on the fritz again.
2956.7,2960.7, There was I was showing Sean this some some awful awful statue.
2960.7,2964.7, They made of like like Mary Jane like Ben and over to his spider man's lawn.
2964.7,2966.7, Here's something terrible.
2966.7,2967.7, That's you.
2967.7,2969.7, The problem though is that after he told that story.
2970.7,2976.7," No one stopped to say, okay, the devil says spider man."
2976.7,2981.7," You can have your grandma, but I don't want you in this relationship."
2981.7,2988.7," Well, it's like when is the fucking you know, that fisto doctor feel."
2988.7,2990.7, That's not okay.
2990.7,2992.7," Okay, but no, if you get enough,"
2993.7,2995.7," you know, men grow test men babies and birds."
2995.7,3000.7," To, uh, basically say scream like he can't be married."
3000.7,3001.7, And I don't understand this.
3001.7,3006.7," There was once a time where you could say you could paint with, you know, with broad strokes and say,"
3006.7,3012.7," Well, people who read spider men don't want spider men married because they married and they can't relate."
3012.7,3018.7," But ever since the advent of Yahoo person, I believe that 90% of spider man readers are now married."
3018.7,3019.7, Not happily.
3019.7,3021.7, Maybe that's the reason.
3022.7,3024.7, Maybe that's why the devil came in.
3024.7,3025.7, But here's what I'm saying.
3025.7,3032.7," I quit reading comic books many, many years ago now, but for a long, long stretch including in my adulthood,"
3032.7,3033.7, I was reading them.
3033.7,3036.7, I was buying super hero comics every Wednesday.
3036.7,3044.7," And, you know, hearing the story from Ryan after being out of the universe long enough that I don't know what the fuck's going on with any of these people anymore."
3044.7,3047.7," Like why, like they're always retconning."
3047.7,3049.7, Everything's been turned around 800 times now.
3049.7,3055.7, Why is another new one even a controversy isn't at this point like it just assumes that they're going to fuck with it all right.
3055.7,3057.7, At the time they do something unpopular. They're going to undo it.
3057.7,3058.7, Yeah.
3058.7,3061.7," Oh, this guy whose dad is like, isn't how Jordan alive again now."
3061.7,3062.7," Yes, he is."
3062.7,3063.7," See, he was dead last time I read it."
3063.7,3065.7, You know how he's alive.
3065.7,3066.7, The story.
3066.7,3068.7, Why can't they just come up with a new comic book?
3068.7,3069.7, I don't know.
3069.7,3070.7, You didn't ask.
3070.7,3072.7, Why does it get to be spider men all the fucking time?
3072.7,3074.7, Like you had to be somebody else.
3074.7,3076.7," Sean, that last man."
3076.7,3077.7, I don't come on.
3077.7,3078.7, I'm sorry.
3078.7,3080.7, That's all good. Go on.
3080.7,3081.7," Oh, no."
3081.7,3083.7," Oh, there's a sad moment on the podcast."
3083.7,3085.7, Sean's giving me a guilt trip right now.
3085.7,3088.7," No, just I was trying for I've been trying to get some name for fast 20 minutes."
3088.7,3091.7," So I'll get man, you never get the talk on this podcast."
3091.7,3093.7, But I got a good one.
3093.7,3094.7, Do you still remember?
3094.7,3096.7," No, you just so forget it now."
3096.7,3097.7, No.
3097.7,3098.7," All right, moments passed."
3098.7,3099.7," All right, my mistake."
3099.7,3100.7, It was a tight podcast.
3100.7,3101.7, It was a tight podcast.
3101.7,3102.7, It was a tight podcast.
3102.7,3104.7, It was a tight podcast.
3104.7,3105.7, It was a tight podcast.
3105.7,3106.7, I know.
3106.7,3107.7, Now we can just make it.
3107.7,3109.7, We can we can deduct what you are going to say.
3109.7,3110.7, Yeah.
3110.7,3112.7," That they totally that yeah, you could watch it."
3112.7,3115.7, You could leave a set of soap opera for six years and come back.
3115.7,3117.7, It's either the same plot line or the plot line.
3117.7,3119.7," No, no, no, no, no."
3119.7,3120.7, So I'm being the same.
3120.7,3121.7, You're going to say.
3121.7,3124.7, So your plot was what that.
3124.7,3125.7, Just it.
3125.7,3130.7, I don't think.
3130.7,3134.7," I just like if you have to tell, I don't any of the people that write those stories."
3134.7,3139.7," If you have to tell the same story, basically, for 30, 40 experiments been around"
3139.7,3141.7," at least like 35 years, you get into that."
3141.7,3145.7, The same problem is soap opera season one.
3145.7,3151.22," Like do kids, girlfriend season two, like bitch gets married season three as"
3151.22,3153.2999999999997, whole gets divorced season four.
3153.2999999999997,3154.2999999999997, Someone's reincarnated.
3154.2999999999997,3156.2999999999997, The devil comes in and the zombies attack.
3156.2999999999997,3157.8999999999996," You know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's so"
3157.8999999999996,3161.54," far worse like, right, if you go into anyone moment, you have these assumptions."
3161.54,3165.34, And you think it's going to be a bunch of people like crying or kissing once in a while
3165.34,3170.34, and like some old step mom coming in and yelling at someone and then her making out
3170.34,3171.34, with stepdad.
3171.34,3175.62, But then now and then you flip through the channels and there's like a ghost or
3175.62,3176.62, some kind of shit on there.
3176.62,3177.62," Yeah, and that's the same."
3177.62,3178.62, That's the same.
3178.62,3179.62, That's the same.
3179.62,3183.5," That's why that's what that's when the devil comes in to tell Spider-Man, who"
3183.5,3186.54, he's who he's supposed to be tapping and who he's not.
3186.54,3189.82, That's why I think the British TV is better than American TV because they're much more
3189.82,3196.02," inclined to like take an idea, a storyline and ended after they'll just do like,"
3196.02,3198.2200000000003, we're going to make this show be six episodes.
3198.2200000000003,3200.02, That way the thing just stays pure.
3200.02,3202.06," They tell a story they get in, they get out."
3202.06,3206.86," Whereas with American TV because I want to keep it on you after year, I mean, the"
3206.86,3212.86," the just as it relates to a running comic book or a running soap opera, even if just like"
3212.86,3216.26," a six or seven season TV series, you're going to run out of ideas."
3216.26,3219.38, You're going to run out of what made this thing great in the first place.
3219.38,3224.1400000000003, And then you're going to start adding the ghosts or the reincarnation or actually he wasn't
3224.1400000000003,3225.1400000000003, really dead.
3225.1400000000003,3227.94," Oh, yeah, it's got to be impossible for like a TV writer to like know the beginning of"
3227.94,3232.2200000000003, the story and like the end of the story and not how long they're going to be forced to
3232.2200000000003,3233.2200000000003, drag that out.
3233.2200000000003,3235.2200000000003, Because most cases there's like 40 writers too.
3235.2200000000003,3238.2200000000003," Yeah, we're seeing it on heroes already in the second season."
3238.2200000000003,3240.26, But I made Shark Jump.
3240.26,3245.3," I mean, in America, we don't stop anything that has any money making potential."
3245.3,3247.1400000000003, We don't close down the ATM.
3247.14,3250.3399999999997," It's like, do you really think there's not going to be another Star Wars movie?"
3250.3399999999997,3251.3399999999997, Give me a fucking break.
3251.3399999999997,3254.3799999999997," You know, there's money to be made."
3254.3799999999997,3255.3799999999997, There will be one.
3255.3799999999997,3258.66," Oh, it was so part of the PR plan to say there isn't going to be one."
3258.66,3259.66," Yeah, sure."
3259.66,3260.66, Yeah.
3260.66,3261.66, Spring it on him.
3261.66,3262.66," Oh, look, I changed my mind again."
3262.66,3263.66, I've heard that.
3263.66,3266.06, They'll make that stuff until people stop showing up.
3266.06,3270.74," We'll tell you, like, with comics and stuff, it's like monthly, you know, serialized storytelling."
3270.74,3273.5," But it, well, they're, so nothing ever moves forward."
3273.5,3274.5, We check our hands.
3274.5,3277.1, How about these characters die and you make new characters.
3277.1,3278.7799999999997," And that's, yeah, they can't do that, right?"
3278.7799999999997,3281.86," I mean, they can't make some die because it's what Robert Singh."
3281.86,3282.86, It's this.
3282.86,3283.86, I got a lot of games.
3283.86,3285.3399999999997, He used to the new characters.
3285.3399999999997,3287.18, We treat our entertainment video the same way.
3287.18,3288.14, We treat our environment.
3290.14,3291.14, Wow.
3291.14,3292.74," That is, yeah."
3292.74,3294.62, It's got another dollar there.
3294.62,3295.46, You keep going.
3295.46,3298.3399999999997, It doesn't matter how bad it is.
3298.3399999999997,3300.7, You go to the last penny.
3300.7,3303.58," So we're going to, okay, yeah, we're going to take a break."
3303.58,3305.18, We're going to be back in a moment.
3307.3399999999997,3311.42, The Star Wars battlefront entertainment pack includes all new limited edition
3311.42,3315.66, lighter slimmer white PSP with Darth Vader art and Star Wars Battlefront
3315.66,3317.2599999999998, Renegade Squadron game.
3317.2599999999998,3320.66, Play on widescreen LCD or on any TV with video out.
3322.7799999999997,3326.7799999999997, This is the second time I've heard this claim in about a week or so.
3326.7799999999997,3329.62, And I met a loss as the where it comes from.
3329.62,3333.06, I could likely find plenty of pictures of him dirty and are sweating.
3333.06,3336.86, But does anyone got any reference for this whole Superman doesn't need to go
3336.86,3338.6600000000003, to the bathroom or sweat thing?
3340.6600000000003,3344.7000000000003, I seem to recall that Mark Schultz when said in Wizard that one of the things he
3344.7000000000003,3348.94, most wanted to do was make Superman able to sweat or to urinate.
3348.94,3354.1, Apparently he wrote a scene that had Superman sweating and editorial wrote back
3354.1,3355.78, that Superman doesn't sweat.
3359.54,3363.2200000000003," I'm sure I've seen him sweat, but then again, even if he has sweat glands,"
3363.2200000000003,3366.26, nothing on earth should make him exert himself to do it.
3366.26,3368.42, And he can punch right into the sun.
3368.42,3371.2200000000003, So no temperature on earth should make him that hot.
3371.2200000000003,3373.0600000000004, It's actually interesting to think about.
3373.0600000000004,3375.5400000000004, Oh yeah.
3375.5400000000004,3381.0600000000004, One of Burns changes in the Superman revamp was how Superman now uses 100% of
3381.0600000000004,3385.94," whatever he ingest for energy and therefore doesn't create waste, including sweat,"
3385.94,3387.94," feces, etc."
3387.94,3392.1000000000004, Why he felt this topic needed explicit address he was beyond me.
3392.1,3400.18," And remember, reading somewhere on time ago that Superman doesn't have to eat"
3400.18,3401.18, so on your right.
3401.18,3402.18, It makes sense.
3402.18,3406.18, He gets everything he needs from our yellow sun.
3406.18,3411.22, I guess this wouldn't be why he doesn't need a urinate or do do.
3411.22,3417.42," Under the yellow sun, his digestive system completely breaks down the food which he chooses"
3417.42,3419.62, to eat and leaves no waste.
3419.62,3426.62," Under a red sun, I'm sure he could and we do all of the same stuff that we have to do."
3426.62,3428.62, I don't know.
3428.62,3435.7, That whole nose wedding thing could play hell on a secret identity.
3435.7,3442.66," Supposed metropolis is hit with a heat wave, not the feeling heat wave, but a real"
3442.66,3443.66, wave.
3443.66,3449.66," I would clerk me able to explain away, not sweating."
3449.66,3454.8199999999997, He could just explain it as his body being really good at regulating temperatures.
3454.8199999999997,3462.74," I mean, I know people who don't sweat at all in conditions that make me sweat gallons."
3462.74,3470.74," Superman doesn't sweat because if he doesn't feel here cold when he unges powers, he'll"
3470.74,3471.74, just go back right.
3471.74,3477.74," I just conflated fucking Earl Vesta, the man hungry man hungry for the written word."
3477.74,3485.62," When he has his powers, it's simply because the fact is that cause people to biologically"
3485.62,3489.02, sweat don't affect him nearly as much.
3489.02,3493.14," When he loses his powers, all bets are off."
3493.14,3498.8999999999996," The idea that he doesn't have to use the bathroom, however, is absurd."
3498.9,3505.9, We all used the bathroom evenly.
3505.9,3507.9, That's from a comic book forum.
3507.9,3510.3," You're like, you're like a white Eddie Murphy."
3510.3,3512.3, You could play like a little more characters.
3512.3,3514.3, He's telling me to keep his mouth shut.
3514.3,3516.54," He's like, that's some up in the tubicum one."
3516.54,3521.46, Let's get shot in a fat suit.
3521.46,3523.34," Unfortunately, I'll say it for next week."
3523.34,3526.58," There's a very, very killer hero of the web."
3526.58,3530.46," I didn't know how this one would go over his last minute, but I couldn't find it like"
3530.46,3533.62, right before we ran in here and we'll bring it back to you.
3533.62,3534.62, Teaser.
3534.62,3535.62, So what do you guys think?
3535.62,3536.62, Does he sweat?
3536.62,3537.62, Does he shake?
3537.62,3539.62, I think he doesn't exist.
3539.62,3548.2999999999997," Oh, why are comic, like you'd never catch like a video game player doing this shit with"
3548.2999999999997,3552.46," like Master Chief, like, have a red hero's of the web."
3552.46,3556.38," Like comic book characters, we just hit the red one about Mad."
3556.38,3561.38, I was in it on the job.
3561.38,3563.9, I'm happy to see it once a week.
3563.9,3565.14, Where I'm not in on the job.
3565.14,3567.14, I'm stupid.
3567.14,3571.98," What was the one where, oh yeah, the team fortress too."
3571.98,3576.06," If you look closely on the document's case on the papers, you'll see the names of"
3576.06,3577.46, maps and they ruined it.
3577.46,3581.62, Despite the fact people still wrote in asking me what resolution they needed to see
3581.62,3585.54, it and what if I could just tell them the names of the maps.
3585.54,3588.58, And it was like that was in the context of the old nerds tale discussion.
3588.58,3592.18," People don't do this with other people, but no one ever asked, does Mary Tyler more"
3592.18,3593.18, take a shit?
3593.18,3594.18, Right.
3594.18,3595.18, Mary Tyler more.
3595.18,3596.18, I'm sure.
3596.18,3597.18, You could look to her to know.
3597.18,3598.18, Have you ever liked someone?
3598.18,3601.06, Mary Tyler more forums because the internet didn't exist back then.
3601.06,3602.06," Well, okay."
3602.06,3604.06, For why Fred Flintstone has a separate bed.
3604.06,3606.06, Have you ever looked at the time?
3606.06,3608.2599999999998," Hey, I saw an urban dictionary."
3608.2599999999998,3611.22," I was, but he just reminded me about Flintstones."
3611.22,3614.4599999999996," Urban dictionary, Flintstone is now a verb."
3614.4599999999996,3621.62," To Flintstone is to move your desk when you're sitting at desk at school, at desk with"
3621.62,3624.3799999999997," a chair, when you move it without getting up."
3624.3799999999997,3627.3799999999997, So like you just lifted up and walked with your feet.
3627.3799999999997,3630.8599999999997, That's why I just Flintstone over the jaw to pick up my pencil.
3630.8599999999997,3635.8199999999997," I'm so glad that what I was saying is as far as people being like this about movies,"
3635.8199999999997,3638.22, if you guys ever looked at the IMDB message boards.
3638.2999999999997,3643.2999999999997," Yes, and God, the specific actors pages because there are some fucking crazy people there."
3643.2999999999997,3646.14," Like, it's just as insane."
3646.14,3648.8199999999997," Okay, so, but just being an egg general."
3648.8199999999997,3650.66," Yeah, I think it may be a trend."
3650.66,3651.66, We need to do a mix.
3651.66,3653.06," Yeah, here is the web."
3653.06,3657.8199999999997, I got one more urban dictionary thing that I just remembered from the same day.
3657.8199999999997,3659.7, Because it relates to this podcast.
3659.7,3664.18," It's when a bunch of guys get together to hang out and talk, you can now call that a"
3664.2599999999998,3665.02, Brodio.
3667.3799999999997,3668.62, This right here is a brodio.
3668.62,3670.62, We're having a Brodio.
3670.62,3673.62," So we could change our name, actually, to GFW Brodio."
3673.62,3674.62, There's another one.
3674.62,3676.62, That's a great circuit.
3676.62,3678.62, Why not?
3678.62,3679.8999999999996," That's actually, yeah."
3679.8999999999996,3681.22," Brodio, what is catchy?"
3681.22,3682.22, Brodio work.
3682.22,3686.66, And we need something we constantly talk about the possibility of renaming our podcasts
3686.66,3691.1," so that we can get people who don't just listen, who aren't just PC gamers."
3691.1,3692.3399999999997," Yeah, but GFW is still there."
3692.34,3696.26," If you got GFW Brodio, because you got the GFW part."
3696.26,3697.26, How about GFW?
3697.26,3698.26, Just Brodio.
3698.26,3699.26, Yeah.
3699.26,3704.86, It kind of has that ring of an FM radio rock station as another name.
3704.86,3708.06," 97.5, the Brodio."
3708.06,3716.86," That is cut in with like an example from a, the talent is intersand man or something."
3716.86,3718.26, I think that's a good idea.
3718.26,3720.38," Okay, here's another urban dictionary thing."
3720.38,3721.38, Is that a crill?
3721.38,3722.2200000000003, That's what I introduced myself.
3722.22,3724.22," Yeah, that's just a crack cocaine."
3724.22,3727.9399999999996," But, uh, like, what do you laugh at it?"
3727.9399999999996,3728.9399999999996, That's not funny.
3728.9399999999996,3731.18, But now by the reason I brought it up was on my mind today.
3731.18,3732.4599999999996, I had the reason I had a crill on the brain.
3732.4599999999996,3735.74, It's because one of the game videos guys comes over and he was talking to asking if
3735.74,3738.9399999999996, I'd been playing the review copy of Gears of War for PC.
3738.9399999999996,3739.9399999999996, Yeah.
3739.9399999999996,3740.9399999999996, And he was talking about ran.
3740.9399999999996,3741.9399999999996," I mean, he's way into it."
3741.9399999999996,3746.22," Jason Bertrand is like, he's a fiend for like years of war on this PC specifically."
3746.22,3747.22, Just a general.
3747.22,3748.22, He's playing it again.
3748.22,3751.54," He was like talking about, he was asking me why, why ram?"
3752.34,3757.82," Doesn't just, to the fuck I'm getting babbling about why ram the end boss doesn't"
3757.82,3761.7, just keep wearing his crill coat because you know the crills are just flying things out of
3761.7,3762.7, my fight the boss.
3762.7,3765.42," Um, spoiler alert, I guess."
3765.42,3767.42, You're not shooting.
3767.42,3772.42," Shoot the crill, the crill protect him and he's like, well, dude, the crill, the"
3772.42,3773.42, crill protect him.
3773.42,3774.42, Why did they ever leave her?
3774.42,3778.58, He could just stay alive forever if he kept them because then he couldn't finish the game
3778.58,3779.58, dummy.
3779.58,3780.58, It's all the way.
3780.58,3786.06," Yeah, that he was like, that the crill was just like a euphemism for for for for crack cocaine"
3786.06,3789.2599999999998, and that he gets ripped up and that all the that's how he gets all the underlings and
3789.2599999999998,3790.74, that came to like do his bidding and stuff.
3790.74,3795.14," They're all like, Jones and for like he does that really nice."
3795.14,3796.14," Well, I started playing this."
3796.14,3798.22, Explain in the extra games are one for the PC.
3798.22,3799.8199999999997, Just to turn it into it.
3799.8199999999997,3800.8199999999997, Yeah.
3800.8199999999997,3801.8199999999997, So gaming discussion.
3801.8199999999997,3802.8199999999997, Okay.
3802.8199999999997,3803.8199999999997, But I'm not that far into it.
3803.8199999999997,3806.8199999999997," And so far, I don't know."
3806.8199999999997,3807.8199999999997, Really.
3807.8199999999997,3808.8199999999997, Yeah.
3808.82,3809.82, I don't know.
3809.82,3817.42," I have to say upfront, I have not made it out of the very first area of the game."
3817.42,3819.1400000000003, So we're talking super early.
3819.1400000000003,3822.3, I just have to say that my gut reaction and this is a game that I want it.
3822.3,3823.3, I am playing.
3823.3,3825.3, I want to play perhaps it'll get better.
3825.3,3830.5, So this is just a gut reaction and the gut reaction was and I played years or more on XO
3830.5,3833.5, 360 all the way through and I liked it a lot.
3833.5,3841.54, But I had a huge disconnect in my gamer brain when I turned this game on and started
3841.54,3846.78, and was playing a shooter with the keyboard and mouse and I couldn't run unless I pressed
3846.78,3850.54, a button and then the button didn't let me run freely.
3850.54,3853.74, The button took takes me into cover.
3853.74,3854.74, Right.
3854.74,3856.06, That's the conceit of gears of war.
3856.06,3857.06, Right.
3857.06,3858.06, Yeah.
3858.06,3859.06, You don't run.
3859.06,3860.42, You're like creeping from area to area.
3860.42,3861.42, But then you can run for cover.
3861.42,3863.46," I'm trying to, I'm just trying to figure out why it was different."
3863.46,3866.2200000000003," Because if you're used to playing Halo, it still just is odd."
3866.2200000000003,3867.2200000000003, Right.
3867.2200000000003,3868.2200000000003, I don't know either.
3868.2200000000003,3870.2200000000003, I'm bringing this up because I couldn't figure out what you're talking about.
3870.2200000000003,3873.98," The roti run thing and then it'll, like if you're doing it around cover, then it'll"
3873.98,3874.98, put you in the cover.
3874.98,3875.98, Yes.
3875.98,3878.58, It feels weird on the PC to me.
3878.58,3881.86, I accepted that game conceit on the 360.
3881.86,3885.46," On the PC now, I'm feeling like I don't have any freedom here."
3885.46,3889.5, What if I just want to run to cover and I want to run right here in this place and
3889.5,3891.1, I want control of the run.
3891.18,3895.86," I don't want the button make, I don't want the button doing the run for me."
3895.86,3896.86, I see what you're saying.
3896.86,3897.86, They can solidate with actions.
3897.86,3900.46, I show where I was on a keyboard.
3900.46,3902.66, You could have had like a secret of the options.
3902.66,3903.66, Right.
3903.66,3904.66, Yeah.
3904.66,3905.66," The running in there, I don't know."
3905.66,3906.66, You get used to it.
3906.66,3910.94," It is like your saying, it's like NASCAR where if you play multiplayer, you have this mindset"
3910.94,3914.54," where you want to rush and get the weapons first, pick up the grenades or whatever it is."
3914.54,3919.54," So the trick is to run into avoid the obstacles, which will make you stick to them,"
3919.54,3920.54, like cover.
3920.54,3925.02, So you kind of anticipate the corner again in an ASCAR or you prep for the perfect curve
3925.02,3926.2599999999998, and go around it.
3926.2599999999998,3927.2599999999998, It's just different.
3927.2599999999998,3932.74," But yeah, I mean, I'm more worried about at this point if the game was it kind of like"
3932.74,3934.74, it had its time last year.
3934.74,3940.2," And now with all these other experiences, the one note nature, you know, because"
3940.2,3943.14," gears, I believe hits that one note so very well."
3943.14,3946.14," But just hits that one note over and over again, if that's really going to."
3946.14,3947.14, Yeah.
3947.14,3951.06," Playing it after I hate to say it because we keep using this comparison, but playing"
3951.06,3954.46, it after the orange box stuff by a shock and all these.
3954.46,3955.46, And by a shock.
3955.46,3959.46," Yeah, I just felt like, oh my god, you know, it's just, yeah, I did this."
3959.46,3962.8599999999997," I mean, it's hard to say because I did play it all the way through already on another"
3962.8599999999997,3963.8599999999997, platform.
3963.8599999999997,3967.66," So maybe if you're a PC gamer who's never experienced this, this is going to feel really"
3967.66,3968.66, cool to you.
3968.66,3970.06, I can't judge that yet.
3970.06,3971.06, Right.
3971.06,3972.06, So it's possible.
3972.06,3973.06, I'll try the multiplayer.
3973.06,3977.1," The other thing I didn't like, which is just whatever."
3977.1,3979.3399999999997, I was talking about this before we podcast.
3979.3399999999997,3983.18," It is, if you go to the, you know, they have a chief men, just like they do on the PC,"
3983.18,3989.74," but you need to be connected to Windows Live, the PC version of Xbox Live to get the"
3989.74,3994.74, achievements and to do other things to connect in multiplayer.
3994.74,4000.22," But the interface screen for, for even doing things like connecting to Windows Live or"
4000.22,4005.98," for checking your achievements, they've got the Xbox Live language up there on the screen."
4006.06,4011.1," You know, if you want to press B, you know, the red B, press A, they're using the actual"
4011.1,4016.3," controller button on the screen, some selves, which that's fine."
4016.3,4017.7400000000002, We've seen that before in games.
4017.7400000000002,4021.06," And we know that you can use this game with the control and in fact, of course, they"
4021.06,4022.06, can use a controller.
4022.06,4023.06, Why you're just playing it.
4023.06,4024.34," Yeah, it's like all's like, I'll be for you."
4024.34,4025.34," But it is like, I'll be for you."
4025.34,4029.06," Yeah, I do find it offensive because they've gone out of their way to make a big deal"
4029.06,4032.22," about, you know, the cross platform capabilities."
4032.22,4033.7400000000002," In fact, that this is now a PC game."
4033.9799999999996,4037.54, So don't put your fucking controller language on the on the game.
4037.54,4039.3399999999997, Autotect when you put the USB.
4039.3399999999997,4042.02," Yes, it's my controllers connected, which it wasn't."
4042.2599999999998,4043.58, Then you can have that on there.
4043.58,4045.14, But I did not have that in there.
4045.14,4046.58, So don't tell me to press B.
4047.2999999999997,4047.9399999999996, You don't get it.
4047.9399999999996,4050.7799999999997, Is that the PC is the Xbox 720.
4052.22,4055.02," Oh, that's a nice fun."
4055.02,4055.8199999999997, I did.
4055.8199999999997,4059.4199999999996," Yeah, it's the it's the years of war a year later with that extra."
4059.5,4061.8199999999997, Some extra degrees of a gratitude in it.
4062.06,4062.54, Right.
4062.62,4064.58, But I just wanted them to remove that stuff.
4064.62,4067.94," I wanted them to say hi, PC gamer."
4068.58,4071.7, We're bringing this game that was out on another platform to you now.
4071.7799999999997,4074.2599999999998, We want you to have this great PC shooter experience.
4074.2599999999998,4074.86, So here you go.
4074.86,4077.38, We have custom tailored this to be for you.
4078.02,4083.06," So therefore, we are going to assume you're using a keyboard and mouse, like 99% of PC gamers"
4083.2599999999998,4085.06, and not talk to you about those other things.
4085.06,4090.62," Unless we detected on your machine, you know, that was it's not it was particularly offensive with"
4090.62,4091.62, the shot.
4091.62,4096.74," I mean, that's one reason why Shadow and Bomsal that on PC is it's like it was so clearly"
4096.74,4101.0199999999995," made for not just the interface and everything, but it was so clearly made for people"
4101.0199999999995,4102.0199999999995, on 360.
4102.0199999999995,4103.0199999999995, Mm-hmm.
4103.0199999999995,4108.38," And it was like, you can launch this initiative with that Halo 2 with these console games."
4108.38,4109.38, Yeah.
4109.38,4113.18," And then like I said, you know, even the bigger nuisance there was to say, well, this"
4113.18,4118.9," is your chance to pit console players against, you know, PC ones and see how it falls into"
4118.9,4119.9, the place.
4119.9,4122.66, We slanted toward the console people.
4122.66,4123.66, Yeah.
4123.66,4124.66," Okay, wait a piss off."
4124.66,4131.879999999999," Oh, by the way, if you haven't seen it yet, we've now, I've now posted that famous photo of"
4131.879999999999,4136.339999999999," the PC Shadow Run players that was in the newest of our magazine, you can now find it"
4136.339999999999,4141.98," up on my blog and the folks over at, you know, Gaff, have it on the GFW thread there."
4141.98,4147.62, So if you want to see a great photo of happy PC gamers playing Shadow Run go and check
4147.62,4148.62, it out.
4148.7,4149.62, It was nice.
4149.62,4150.62," Now you know, we're making fun of it."
4150.62,4151.62, Yeah.
4151.62,4154.18," It was funny because it right before the podcast, I found like an old penny arcade where"
4154.18,4157.78, they were making fun of an ad where someone was playing the box art to work referee.
4157.78,4158.78, Yeah.
4158.78,4159.78, Right.
4159.78,4160.78, It was awesome.
4160.78,4161.78," Awesome, buddy."
4161.78,4164.0599999999995," It was awesome, buddy."
4164.0599999999995,4167.46," Any of you guys play, uh, you T3 demo since last time we met?"
4167.46,4168.46, Not now.
4168.46,4169.46, I had.
4169.46,4170.46, No one.
4170.46,4173.0599999999995, Nens caught the end of the game.
4173.0599999999995,4176.099999999999," What do you got to say about it, Sean?"
4176.099999999999,4177.74, Do you like it a more hate and a more?
4177.82,4178.74," Uh, I'm not liking."
4178.74,4179.74, It's about the same.
4179.74,4183.54," It was one of those cases when I first turned it on, I realized that wasn't that into"
4183.54,4184.54, it.
4184.54,4185.74, But I didn't know why.
4185.74,4188.98," In the more time I spent with it, the closer I think I'm getting."
4188.98,4194.38," But before that, there's just some like general like corny cheesy things about it, which"
4194.38,4196.0199999999995, isn't necessarily so bad.
4196.0199999999995,4200.179999999999," But for some reason, every time I put the game down, that's greed."
4200.179999999999,4202.74," Which is like, gross and weird."
4202.74,4203.74, Gross and weird.
4203.74,4204.74, This is Sean's new.
4204.74,4206.74, I knew we're real in the game.
4206.74,4207.74," That's really, yeah."
4207.74,4209.74," That's greed, man."
4209.74,4212.26," Um, no, but part of it is so ridiculous."
4212.26,4217.86," You get in, um, these characters and people are hitting the taunts and you hear, and"
4217.86,4219.74, that's not me censoring myself.
4219.74,4220.74, That's what it's like.
4220.74,4221.74, Yeah.
4221.74,4222.74, Yeah.
4222.74,4223.74, And then you hear off.
4223.74,4225.74," Whoa, I'm on fire."
4225.74,4228.74," And then, uh, but you'll feel that one in a moment."
4228.74,4229.74," It's like, what the fuck is that?"
4229.74,4231.74," I wouldn't be doing that in that series like, forever."
4231.74,4232.74, That's it.
4232.74,4234.74," And it's very, like, much like Mortal Kombat."
4235.74,4237.74," For some reason, this voice actor, I now hate you."
4237.74,4239.74, You hear him over and over again.
4239.74,4240.74, Yeah.
4240.74,4242.74," But then like, there's just this ridiculous joke."
4242.74,4246.26," You're, I mean, you just go around and you just mash that key the whole time and your"
4246.26,4248.74, face pops up in the corner and then you hear the taunt.
4248.74,4253.179999999999," So like, I'll get in there and just that, I'll bind it to a key that I can hit with"
4253.179999999999,4254.179999999999, my pinky all the time.
4254.179999999999,4255.179999999999," Like, shit."
4255.179999999999,4257.179999999999, And so you just unleash this constant.
4257.179999999999,4260.179999999999, And then I'm on fire.
4260.179999999999,4264.179999999999," And, uh, in addition to that, the people really get mad."
4264.18,4265.18, Yeah.
4265.18,4266.18," Like, shut up."
4266.18,4269.58," And then they eventually, because there's no like, for some reason, I have never been into"
4269.58,4271.5, a UT3 demo server with an admin.
4271.5,4272.58, No one can kick me.
4272.58,4275.1," And they eventually like, and it says it to both teams."
4275.1,4276.34," And they're like, I'm I'm out of here."
4276.34,4277.34, That's it.
4277.34,4278.34, I'm out of here.
4278.34,4279.34, And people get so mad.
4279.34,4281.54," But I tell them, like, this is, no, it's creating an emotional high point when I play."
4281.54,4284.26," And like, dude, you're not even doing it when you're getting a kill."
4284.26,4286.26, You just keep fucking pressing the button.
4286.26,4287.26," They're, they're just spots."
4287.26,4288.26, Yeah.
4288.26,4289.26, I'm not.
4289.26,4292.26, They're in people listening right now.
4292.26,4293.9400000000005," They're like, God, shun's an asshole."
4293.9400000000005,4297.34," You're like, going around, like, fucking with people today, review your game."
4297.34,4298.34, This is a new game.
4298.34,4299.34, Yeah.
4299.34,4300.34, Yeah.
4300.34,4302.34, Why did you put that in the game?
4302.34,4303.54, Do you at least get to select your taught?
4303.54,4304.54, Or is it to random taught?
4304.54,4305.54," Like, random taught?"
4305.54,4307.18," Like, it's like Target, which is the worst."
4307.18,4309.22, There's another default in there.
4309.22,4311.26, Whereas it's like text to voice.
4311.26,4314.820000000001," And if you have that on, anytime someone type something, you hear the Steven Hawking"
4314.820000000001,4316.74, voice come in and repeat it.
4316.74,4318.7," So the first time you play, not literally."
4318.7,4322.14," It's just this like, incest and torn of babbling"
4322.14,4323.14, computers.
4323.14,4324.14, What the hell is going on?
4324.14,4328.02," It's like, people talking about video play."
4328.02,4329.02, People talking about video play.
4329.02,4330.02, How?
4330.02,4332.38, It creates an emotional high point.
4332.38,4332.780000000001, F.
4332.780000000001,4333.38, Yeah.
4333.38,4334.38, But it's high point.
4334.38,4337.5," And you just like, so you spam that and you double up with the text."
4337.5,4338.860000000001, That actually sounds really fun.
4338.860000000001,4339.860000000001, That does sound fun.
4339.860000000001,4345.700000000001," I remember when I was playing Team Fortress 2 with you, I guess it was a couple"
4345.700000000001,4346.700000000001, of East Gun now.
4346.700000000001,4349.660000000001," And you and I were both, we kept just, run the whole level."
4349.660000000001,4351.860000000001," We weren't, you and I weren't even talking about how we were going to do it."
4351.86,4352.86, We were just about doing it.
4352.86,4354.46, We kept hitting the medic key nonstop.
4354.46,4355.46," Medic, medic, medic."
4355.46,4356.82, That's not even as bad.
4356.82,4359.54, I got yelled at because I was doing it.
4359.54,4360.7, And this was after you left.
4360.7,4361.7, And I wasn't medic.
4361.7,4366.66," So I kept doing that and then some guy goes, you asshole, you are a medic."
4366.66,4368.9," And I said, yeah, I'm saying I am one."
4368.9,4370.9, I have a vagabelable.
4370.9,4372.9, That's why I'm doing this.
4372.9,4373.9, Medic care.
4373.9,4374.9, Medic.
4374.9,4377.62, It's ready to turn you to kill.
4377.62,4381.339999999999," So there's something, a few things I'm getting closer to figuring out what it is."
4381.34,4384.34, I've been mainly playing vehicle CTF.
4384.34,4386.5, And it seems kind of bloated to me.
4386.5,4389.9800000000005," Like they, someone comes up with an idea and they say, hey, this will be cool."
4389.9800000000005,4391.7, And it does seem like a cool idea.
4391.7,4393.66, And then they put it in and maybe it doesn't work.
4393.66,4396.900000000001, The way that it was proposed to work.
4396.900000000001,4400.38," And they leave it in and then they say, well, we can have to find some other solution."
4400.38,4401.54, And then they keep doing that.
4401.54,4405.66," So an example would be, you take the impact hammer and you say, let's give it an Altfire,"
4405.66,4406.900000000001, which would be hitting mouse too.
4406.900000000001,4408.1, Let's break it down for Robert.
4408.1,4410.1," He says, what the hell am I talking to?"
4410.1,4412.1, What is that?
4412.1,4413.1, Most two.
4413.1,4415.1, The impact hammer is your melee.
4415.1,4416.1, Is it me?
4416.1,4421.1, The impact hammer is your melee weapon.
4421.1,4427.1," And if you, you know, as in all unreal tournament games, you have a primary"
4427.1,4430.1, secondary and sometimes tertiary fire modes.
4430.1,4432.1," The second one, you talk in syllables."
4432.1,4433.1, Isn't it?
4433.1,4434.1, It.
4434.1,4438.1, It's like lots of them.
4438.1,4439.1, Yeah.
4439.1,4440.1, Okay.
4440.1,4441.1, So let me say this.
4441.1,4442.1, Let me say this thing.
4442.1,4443.1, Okay.
4443.1,4448.1," So the MP Altfire on it, supposed to eject someone from a vehicle."
4448.1,4452.6, But the problem is the majority of the vehicles fly so fast and hit you so quickly and
4452.6,4455.1, kill you so instantly.
4455.1,4457.1," That, like, there's no point to it."
4457.1,4460.1, There's no way you're going to hit anyone and knock them out.
4460.1,4464.1, Maybe it works for a tank or something if you're lucky enough to get up a side it and you can
4464.1,4465.1, eject them from that.
4465.1,4466.1, So it seems cool.
4466.1,4469.3," But then you're like, okay, what do you do against, they have this man to, you know, sort"
4469.3,4471.3, of a little flying skiff vehicle.
4471.3,4474.1, It's super lethal because it just runs everyone over.
4474.1,4477.1," Um, like, what do I do about this thing?"
4477.1,4479.1," It is, it's going to run me over instantly."
4479.1,4480.1, So there's a faint death key.
4480.1,4481.1," And like, hey, that's pretty interesting."
4481.1,4484.1," But of course, you're adding another layer of complexity to it."
4484.1,4485.1, So you faint death.
4485.1,4487.1, But then you realize he doesn't see that your name.
4487.1,4490.1, It doesn't say he killed you or anything or fake them out in that way.
4490.1,4494.1, So we just turns around and either shoots you or runs you over again in the second time by hitting
4494.1,4495.1, his all fire.
4495.1,4498.1, He lowers his vehicle to the ground and then he scrapes you off the sidewalk.
4498.1,4503.1, So what happens then is that the faint death key is basically bend over and spread your
4503.1,4504.1, cheeks for the medic.
4504.1,4508.1," Now it's like, here comes a med to what do you call it that."
4508.1,4510.1," Here's, I have a couple options here."
4510.1,4513.1, I let it run me over or do I lay down and let it run.
4513.1,4524.1," You know, then, you know, then, so to counter, you know, the the leethality of vehicles,"
4524.1,4529.1," they add rockets, the Avrilow rocket and it locks on by holding one button down."
4529.1,4532.1," And once you want to lock down to someone, it doesn't even, it's instant."
4532.1,4535.1," Lillin, you just press the button and if something's on the screen, it will lock to whatever"
4535.1,4536.1, vehicles on the screen.
4536.1,4540.1," And then you press fire as long as you kick the other one down, it will track it and blow it up."
4540.1,4543.1," There's very, very few circumstances where you can evade it."
4543.1,4545.1, There's no counter measures or anything.
4545.1,4547.1," And you ask people, what the hell are you supposed to do about that?"
4547.1,4550.1," And they say, you got to get out of the vehicle."
4550.1,4551.1, Like that's great.
4551.1,4552.1, What if you're flying?
4552.1,4554.1, There's no parachute in this game.
4554.1,4556.1," You know, you got to get out of the vehicle."
4556.1,4560.1," So, and then you add to that that this vehicle seat."
4560.1,4563.1," Yeah, and it's this very small map you're going back and forth."
4563.1,4566.1," And hey, the quick moving vehicles like mantis and stuff I understand,"
4566.1,4570.1," this seems like great, you know, in and out cap vehicles because,"
4570.1,4574.1," while you can't ride the vehicle while you have the flag, people can attach to it with the,"
4574.1,4577.1, this sort of tether line and follow you along on that seems great.
4577.1,4582.1," But then there's like, why is there artillery, your mobile artillery and the aircraft,"
4582.1,4583.1, and all these other things?
4583.1,4585.1, It just kind of seems like superfluous.
4585.1,4587.1," You know, it's like they don't see support vehicles."
4587.1,4589.1," But for cap in this flag across the map,"
4589.1,4593.1, it's basically there's one side and there's a blue flag and there's another.
4593.1,4596.1, And you just go across this bridge or beneath the bridge.
4596.1,4598.1," It just, I don't know."
4598.1,4600.1, It just doesn't work so well for me.
4600.1,4604.1, And then the other significant issue that I can put my finger on is that you never know what
4604.1,4605.1, killed you.
4605.1,4610.1," I mean, in general in games, you ask place shooters that, you know how annoying that is."
4610.1,4611.1, Yeah.
4611.1,4614.1," When it's just all of a sudden you're there, you have something, and then it's like your dad."
4614.1,4616.1, You look sideways on the ground.
4616.1,4617.1, Yeah.
4617.1,4619.1, And they don't zoom in on the guy you killed.
4619.1,4620.1, Do you have anything?
4620.1,4621.1," No, there's no death cam."
4621.1,4624.1," It'll say who did it, but you don't know what they killed you with or it."
4624.1,4625.1, That's hard.
4625.1,4627.1, It doesn't even have an icon of like what I mean.
4627.1,4628.1, Not that I'm able to see.
4628.1,4629.1, No.
4629.1,4632.1," And it's just like, wow, because that comes back to like doom and quake."
4632.1,4633.1, Right.
4633.1,4637.1," And so what happens, you kind of just feel like you don't build up this sense of rye."
4637.1,4639.1," Even for some reason, even though it says this name,"
4639.1,4647.1, I never build up this kind of rivalry in the gratification you get from playing multiplayer games.
4647.1,4651.1," It almost feels like I'm playing bots even though it's human, which is weird."
4651.1,4653.1, And that thing is all important.
4653.1,4656.1," I'm realizing for me, you know, when I play battlefield, if I'm a single infantry guy and I take"
4656.1,4660.1," out a whole squad, I feel like there's just that little oomph."
4660.1,4664.1," Like when you're playing sports or something, like yeah, or even if you're playing ping pong or"
4664.1,4667.1," a fuzball, you know, when you win, it feels good."
4667.1,4669.1, And it just don't get that ever.
4669.1,4673.1, Even when I go in like a crazy spree and kill like 14 dudes in a row.
4673.1,4676.1, Maybe it's like it's simulating what it's like to be a psychotic mass murder.
4676.1,4680.1," Yeah, just feel 18 people and I feel nothing."
4680.1,4684.1, All I feel is emptiness of my soul.
4684.1,4686.1, They need to keep for that.
4686.1,4688.1, I feel empty.
4688.1,4692.1, They might.
4692.1,4701.1," So that's, I'm still trying to figure out exactly what what it is."
4701.1,4704.1," It's causing that, but yeah, it's just not there."
4704.1,4706.1, And I've heard other people say the same.
4706.1,4710.1," They're like, yeah, I don't really feel like, don't feel that like, you know, suck it down when you"
4710.1,4712.1," you kill and then when you die, it's just kind of the sobacteria."
4712.1,4714.1," There's no spawn time, just there."
4714.1,4719.1," You are again and kind of roaming around and it's not horrible game, but it's just not."
4719.1,4722.1, It's not doing it for me for some reason.
4722.1,4724.1, I'm just a box quote.
4724.1,4726.1, I'm not doing it for me for some reason.
4726.1,4727.1," This is the beta, of course."
4727.1,4728.1, Right.
4728.1,4733.1," I'm not even playing beyond slot mode or, you know, the, I mean, the big new stuff that they put in the game."
4733.1,4737.1," But it remains to be seen, but they have some serious competition this year."
4737.1,4738.1, Yeah.
4738.1,4739.1," And it's, yeah."
4739.1,4742.1," They're, they're very few servers up for it's, surprisingly."
4742.1,4745.1," Compared to likes, they went to Fortress 2 beta came out."
4745.1,4748.1, How many occupied populated servers there are.
4748.1,4752.1," They're very, very few with these UT3 demo, which seems kind of."
4752.1,4756.1," What I'd like to know and I know we're running out of time this week is like,"
4756.1,4759.1," how, how popular, how many, how the,"
4759.1,4763.1, how the populated the enemy territories are right now.
4763.1,4768.1," Because yeah, they, a lot of it when I've been playing a little bit, a lot of,"
4768.1,4772.1, and I do like that game realizing I don't like it as much as battlefield 2.
4772.1,4774.1, It's a different game.
4774.1,4776.1, But I do like it a lot.
4776.1,4780.1, It's a lot of Australians and Brits and Germans and stuff.
4780.1,4782.1, So it seems like a lot of it's on North American.
4782.1,4785.1, Like it's doing well in other markets.
4785.1,4787.1," Yeah, we'll have to check that out."
4787.1,4792.1," I think that's a great game, but I do definitely like putting that,"
4792.1,4798.1," I so far I really prefer it to the demo, all those, the most fair comparison."
4798.1,4802.1," I mean, I think I just suffering from TF2 timing."
4802.1,4804.1," Yeah, man, I mean, territory."
4804.1,4805.1, Yeah.
4805.1,4807.1," So many games out right now, you know."
4807.1,4809.1, And also opposite to life.
4809.1,4812.1," Even other genres, it's like, I continue like now it's weird."
4812.1,4814.1, Like I still play opposing France a lot.
4814.1,4818.1, We had an awesome 4v4 game against some people that listened to podcasts other night.
4818.1,4821.1," Yeah, I want to give them a shout out here."
4821.1,4823.1, I forget their names.
4823.1,4825.1," This is near A, B."
4825.1,4826.1," Well, they kind of just joined."
4826.1,4830.1, I added a bunch of other friends list and maybe next time we'll set things up more.
4830.1,4834.1," Talking, I felt bad because some of the people on my team were talking shit."
4834.1,4837.1, Because there's this a treat it.
4837.1,4841.1," Like if you get in someone's back base and the moment you know you're going to win,"
4841.1,4844.1, you just get that giddy like now it's time to talk shit.
4844.1,4848.1," But a moment ago, you didn't dare say I think because there's a chance that like you go to backfire."
4848.1,4851.1," They would have been like, oh yeah, what do you say now, bitch?"
4851.1,4857.1," But so a couple of people, as soon as they get in that back base and they start the end game scenario stuff."
4857.1,4859.1," How do you, I'm so deep in you, how does it feel?"
4859.1,4861.1, How do you describe the feeling of this moment?
4861.1,4864.1," Is, are you having the game, of course, is called big fun?"
4864.1,4866.1," Yeah, how big is the fun that you had?"
4866.1,4869.1, She described this is a big fun.
4869.1,4871.1, I didn't think.
4871.1,4875.1," But so I, we're getting the time warning, but yeah, we're getting it."
4875.1,4876.1, Is it about that?
4876.1,4877.1, Left or dead?
4877.1,4879.1," Yeah, yeah, very, very, very please."
4879.1,4881.1, You guys interested in left or dead?
4881.1,4883.1, Definitely it should be left or dead.
4883.1,4885.1," Tell the fuck, yes you are."
4885.1,4887.1, Tell the fuck to let left or dead is.
4887.1,4888.1, In case they don't know.
4888.1,4890.1," Ryan, I think actually you would like it."
4890.1,4891.1, You would.
4891.1,4892.1, Ryan shut up.
4892.1,4893.1, Thank you.
4893.1,4894.1, I think you can join me.
4894.1,4896.1," It's like cooking on, but more Japanese."
4897.1,4898.1, Exactly.
4898.1,4901.1," Ryan, thanks for telling me more."
4901.1,4904.1, I don't like the direction this is going.
4904.1,4905.1, It's like Spider-Man.
4905.1,4907.1, It's up he's still married to Mary Jane.
4907.1,4908.1," Oh, so."
4910.1,4913.1," So you're, it's a four players cooperative game."
4913.1,4916.1, They also has some elements of a competitive game in it.
4916.1,4919.1, Made by by Valve and Turtle Rock.
4919.1,4922.1," Turtle Rock is, you know, it's code developed by the two."
4922.1,4927.1, Turtle Rock is the group who did the bots for Counter Strike.
4927.1,4930.1, Number of C.S. maps stuff like that.
4930.1,4933.1, They've had a long working relationship with Valve.
4933.1,4934.1," And, uh, chat."
4934.1,4936.1," As a chat, fellas, that's writing it."
4936.1,4939.1," He's, you know, one of the him and Eric will paw rope portal."
4939.1,4942.1," And, you know, dialogue for team fortress two stuff."
4942.1,4943.1, So.
4943.1,4947.1, It's a name that people are learning.
4947.1,4950.1, I was looking around everyone stared at me.
4950.1,4951.1, I know.
4951.1,4952.1," Okay, so we're just interested."
4952.1,4953.1," You have, all right."
4953.1,4954.1," So four players, your humans."
4954.1,4956.1, It's a zombie apocalypse.
4956.1,4959.1," It's up, of course, they're, they're called infected."
4959.1,4963.1," Um, they're, they've got some disease that makes them want to eat you."
4963.1,4965.1," And, uh, but they can't be killed."
4965.1,4969.1," So anyway, in, in, in the most simplistic sense,"
4969.1,4973.1," it's like having, you know, two to four people play this cooperative game."
4973.1,4976.1, Where zombies are attacking you in creepy environments.
4976.1,4979.1," But they are very fast, you know, it's the fast moving sort."
4979.1,4980.1, They're super agile.
4980.1,4982.1, There's almost really nowhere to hide in that.
4982.1,4984.1," If you climb something, they'll climb up after you."
4984.1,4986.1, They'll leap off to goals.
4986.1,4991.1," They come in, um, they're dynamically, you know, every time you play a campaign, which,"
4991.1,4994.1," therefore, they enter the environment in a different location."
4994.1,4995.1, But it's always a good.
4995.1,4997.1," It's like, you don't look somewhere and see a bunch of them just appeared."
4997.1,5000.1," Like, they come in through, like, there's pipes on the ceiling."
5000.1,5004.1," If there's a forest, which is, you know, one of the new levels I played, they just come out"
5004.1,5005.1," for, come out of the trees and stuff."
5005.1,5007.1, And now the dark parts of the forest.
5008.1,5013.1," So as you're playing from that point of view, you're thinking, you know, originally when I heard about it,"
5013.1,5015.1," it was like, okay, that sounds really simple."
5015.1,5018.1, And there's this other element of the game that sounded more promising.
5018.1,5019.1, And I'll tell you about that in a moment.
5019.1,5023.1," But when I, as soon as I played it, and here's one of those cases where, you know, when we talk about"
5023.1,5027.1," when we write previews and it's like, oh, you can't really be, you know, two of the value of the stuff."
5027.1,5030.1," It's like, one of those times where every time I played it, you're like, that's a great game."
5030.1,5032.1, This is going to be a great game.
5032.1,5035.1," I have no doubts about it because like, it was so much fun playing it."
5035.1,5040.1," If like, I just, I would have went and bought it based on the, based on, you know, the time I spent playing it."
5040.1,5047.1," And you can also see that like, yeah, I can give this to other, if I show other people, they're going to like looking at it and they're going to want to play it to."
5047.1,5053.1," So I know it'll be fun. Like Robert, I know, we'll be able to get some of us to all play it."
5053.1,5056.1, So it's kind of just the usual tense thing.
5056.1,5059.1," You know, zombies are running everywhere, coming and attacking you."
5059.1,5062.1, And you're sort of creating sectors of fire if you're smart.
5062.1,5066.1," So, you know, and always watching your back because, you know, because they can come from everywhere again."
5066.1,5069.1," If one of you goes down, there's the cooperative element where you can help them up."
5069.1,5073.1, You could share your health packs. You have a fine amount of them and stuff like that.
5073.1,5080.1," And then they mix it up by putting these, you know, sort of super types of zombies in that they call boss infected."
5080.1,5085.1," And one of them, for example, is this just bloated, you know, fat monsters, piece of shit."
5085.1,5088.1," And he, he pukes on you."
5089.1,5095.1," And if he pukes on you, you suddenly, it's like this fair moon that drives the rest of the regular zombies, like,"
5095.1,5099.1," Apshit. And they all just come running it out of the woodwork at you, you know, 15, 20 at a time."
5099.1,5104.1," That's another part that makes it so fun is that not only are they super fast, but they're so many of them."
5104.1,5108.1," It's like overwhelming. When you first see a rush of these things coming, you're like,"
5108.1,5112.1," Dude, there's no way I'm going to be able to kill all of these, like, they're totally going to get me."
5112.1,5114.1," So he'll do, he's up to that."
5114.1,5120.1," And he also blows up if he shoot him. So if he gets near you, or if he's like about to puk on your teammates,"
5120.1,5124.1," It's kind of a problem. Like, like, the shoot him, he's going to blow up and it's going to hurt my teammate worse."
5124.1,5130.1," Whereas the pukes not going to hurt him, but it's going to, it's going to potentially be even more disastrous by, you know,"
5130.1,5133.1, bringing in a whole bunch of other enemies to attack us when one of us is down.
5133.1,5137.1, And we still need to go pick him back up or one of us is over here healing.
5137.1,5140.1, So then you start getting in scenarios like that.
5140.1,5145.1," A second one is called a smoke or he's got the super long tongue. I mean, we've just, a lot of people know all this."
5145.1,5149.1," So but, you know, again, I'll try to go through the basics quickly. And then with that tongue, you can grab you,"
5149.1,5153.1," choke you if he's standing somewhere above you, it'll act like a news and he can pull you up."
5153.1,5156.1," Very slowly, of course, though. Not a more kill you instantly."
5156.1,5160.1, They almost like all incapacitate one of you in some way shape or form.
5160.1,5166.1," And that's to enhance the tension because every time one of the four, you know, the four becomes three or the three becomes two,"
5166.1,5172.1, it gets increasingly more difficult to the point where it's just like absolutely desperate to get your other guys back into the game.
5172.1,5176.1," And combo them, someone gets you at the tongue."
5176.1,5179.1," Then another guy goes, pukes my puk on you."
5179.1,5181.1, There's this big thing called a tank.
5181.1,5184.1," Just it's basically super strong, reviving environment through it."
5184.1,5187.1," Oh, I think."
5187.1,5188.1, Okay.
5188.1,5193.1," So, and then the twist is that those can all be, those can all be controlled by the CPU,"
5193.1,5198.1, but then another four human players can come in and play those roles.
5198.1,5203.1, Another fourth of the zombie boss effect is called Hunter and he has his own powers.
5203.1,5207.1," So, instead of, you know, when people look at it,"
5207.1,5210.1," it's not really complicated. It seems like it should be easy to explain,"
5210.1,5212.1, but people always assume zombie game.
5212.1,5217.1, There's people playing zombies. They must have been players that were humans that got bit and turned into the zombie players.
5217.1,5221.1," But rather, the humans are always on the human side and the zombies are always on their side."
5221.1,5225.1, And they come in and are basically trying to kill you.
5225.1,5227.1," And, but they're individually weak."
5227.1,5231.1," You shoot them a few times and they die and, so the zombies win."
5231.1,5234.1," The zombies can win, especially if you're effective."
5234.1,5236.1," And like, in the case when I played, so now to get into the new stuff,"
5236.1,5238.1, this new level is called corn field.
5238.1,5242.1," It starts off in a forest and it was absolutely, you know, creepy environment."
5242.1,5246.1," Stuff just, you know, coming out of everywhere and you're constantly looking around"
5246.1,5248.1," to flash light, checking behind you, you'll hear noise."
5248.1,5249.1, And they make great sounds.
5249.1,5253.1, You hear the boomer spewing.
5253.1,5257.1, Spewing vomit.
5257.1,5259.1, You'll hear him coming from somewhere and freak out.
5259.1,5263.1," And they throw in the usual, like, nightmare in El Street, music or whatever it is."
5263.1,5267.1, And so you're going through an eventually you go through this big corn field.
5267.1,5269.1, And you're on this farm and you're trying to get to the farmhouse in the middle.
5269.1,5271.1, And there's some barns and stuff.
5271.1,5274.1," And if dynamically if the zombies start attacking when you're in the corn,"
5274.1,5276.1, it's crazy because it's hard to see anything.
5276.1,5280.1," And they're just rushing, like right through you from all directions in this."
5280.1,5284.1," And so in the case when I played, we actually all ended up dying."
5284.1,5285.1, We didn't make it.
5285.1,5288.1, You're supposed to like hold out long enough for this truck to come and pick you up.
5288.1,5291.1, And you all hop in the back of there and it's got machines on it.
5291.1,5293.1," And we, the last, we started going down one by one."
5293.1,5296.1, So the tank basically incapacitated one of us.
5296.1,5298.1, Starts beating the shit out of them.
5298.1,5299.1, And then we're all freaking out like shoot the tank.
5299.1,5300.1, Get them off.
5300.1,5301.1, We got to save this guy.
5301.1,5304.1, But then the other guys exploit that opening.
5304.1,5308.1," So boomer comes up behind you when you're distracted, shooting the tank and he peaks on you."
5308.1,5310.1, Then you've got 20 more zombies attacking you.
5310.1,5312.1," And then next thing, two of us are down."
5312.1,5314.1, And then it's like you break and you freak out.
5314.1,5316.1, And then it like really fell apart.
5316.1,5317.1, So one of us ran into the barn.
5317.1,5319.1, There's a mini gun.
5319.1,5321.1," And we're like, okay, I'm going to at least get on this."
5321.1,5322.1, But then your back's exposed.
5322.1,5324.1," And without someone else there to protect your back,"
5324.1,5328.1, then other guys came down and nailed the person on the gun.
5328.1,5331.1, And in the last person was kind of running around in the house.
5331.1,5333.1, And the zombies are pouring through the windows.
5333.1,5336.1, Leaping up to the second floor and coming in.
5336.1,5339.1, Basically any place where there's an opening that they could fit through.
5339.1,5341.1, They're just rushing in into this house.
5341.1,5345.1, And the truck gets there and he's running outside at full tilt.
5345.1,5349.1, And they basically get him and take him down or he's like inches from the goal line.
5349.1,5351.1, And like the last zombie gets him.
5351.1,5354.1," And they're like, just, you know, people playing on that team are super excited."
5354.1,5355.1, Because it is more difficult.
5355.1,5357.1, It's far more difficult to do that.
5357.1,5361.1, To win as a as a zombie player.
5361.1,5366.1," So the extent that I was wondering if they're really just there to facilitate the enjoyment of the human players,"
5366.1,5370.1," you know, which seems kind of weird like that's why I asked if it's going to take like, yeah,"
5370.1,5372.1, is it going to take a special mentality?
5372.1,5375.1, And I think it's definitely they're not going to be for everyone.
5375.1,5378.1," I haven't played from that side of the equation in a while,"
5378.1,5383.1," but it was definitely, I had more fun on the human side."
5383.1,5386.1," But the thing is, is even though we lost there,"
5386.1,5388.1, it worked out in such a way that it was great.
5388.1,5389.1," I mean, that's particular thing."
5389.1,5390.1, They couldn't have planned it better.
5390.1,5395.1," And it would be like, here's the great horror movie that ends in disaster for everyone with the zombies ruling the earth."
5395.1,5399.1," And it was like, it worked out like perfectly in just in that scenario."
5399.1,5403.1," But it's like, it's just, I think it's going to be a great game that everyone's going to want to say,"
5403.1,5406.1," hey, let's just log in and play a campaign because you can play each one separately."
5406.1,5408.1, And they're in different environments.
5408.1,5411.1, Maybe you'll start messing with the infected later on.
5411.1,5415.1," And because of the dynamic, you know, spawned his system and things that that changed"
5415.1,5418.1, it up every time plus the element of having human players that are unknowns.
5418.1,5421.1," And you're always wondering, when you see a boss in fact type,"
5421.1,5423.1, you're always trying to figure out from the behavior.
5423.1,5426.1, Is that is that a human or is that a CPU?
5426.1,5432.1," And in most cases, you're going to be more fearful of it if it's human because they'll trick you like they'll run out."
5432.1,5436.1," And then, you know, they'll miss a pound to tack on purpose and you're like,"
5436.1,5437.1," oh, that bastard's mine."
5437.1,5441.1, I'll chase him and you chase him around the corner and there's an ambush that the other dudes waiting for you.
5441.1,5442.1, And they'll nail you.
5446.1,5447.1," So, someone's going on."
5447.1,5449.1," Okay, never mind, that's it, whatever."
5449.1,5450.1," Well, we're at the time."
5450.1,5451.1," Yeah, I know we're done."
5451.1,5452.1, Yeah.
5452.1,5454.1," But it's really, yeah, it sounds really cool."
5454.1,5455.1, Yeah.
5455.1,5456.1," I'd want one more question though, for you."
5456.1,5458.1, Can you play it by yourself?
5458.1,5459.1," Yeah, you can."
5459.1,5461.1, You can play all against bots and off-line if you want.
5461.1,5462.1, It's just certainly a lot more fun.
5462.1,5465.1," So, what do you have with you have bots on your side then?"
5465.1,5467.1, As humans or was it just be you against them?
5467.1,5468.1, I don't know about that.
5468.1,5470.1, I think maybe you can.
5470.1,5471.1, It's a present I didn't know.
5471.1,5473.1, I suppose you have all my eccentric game.
5474.1,5476.1," But like, hey, of course I'll play it with other people."
5476.1,5477.1, Right.
5477.1,5478.1, Town school.
5478.1,5479.1, Yeah.
5479.1,5480.1, I'm definitely going to have to do it.
5480.1,5481.1, That's genuine.
5481.1,5483.1," Like, you can hold me to this if it comes out and it's a piece of shit."
5483.1,5486.1," You can say, hey, he was on there giving the sales pitch."
5486.1,5488.1, But I've convinced it now.
5488.1,5489.1, It's been three times and I've played it.
5489.1,5491.1, Played through entire campaigns.
5491.1,5494.1," No, there's also one I want to be in the conf..."
5494.1,5497.1, They had it there when I went for that TF2 story.
5497.1,5499.1, Way back when it was awesome.
5499.1,5500.1, It was totally cool.
5501.1,5503.1, There was that resident evil game a while back.
5503.1,5504.1, Where it was online.
5504.1,5508.1, And it was like four people trying to survive a resident evil game.
5508.1,5510.1, And I wanted that to be so good.
5510.1,5511.1, Right.
5511.1,5512.1, And then it wasn't.
5512.1,5514.1," And like, this seems to be like what I wanted that game to be."
5514.1,5515.1, Yeah.
5515.1,5516.1, Just like a such a cool idea.
5516.1,5517.1, It's just super twitch.
5517.1,5519.1," You know, and that like that makes the difference."
5519.1,5520.1, Yeah.
5520.1,5521.1, Yeah.
5521.1,5522.1, Yeah.
5522.1,5523.1," Reson the evil did not lend itself to that, obviously."
5523.1,5524.1, I don't get one thing.
5524.1,5527.1," If you're on the zombie side and you dial the time, do you just respond like instantly?"
5527.1,5529.1," No, they have a bad spot on timer."
5529.1,5532.1, So they're trying to figure out that's part of the problem too.
5532.1,5535.1, As if you dial easily like if you mess up and you just run out is one of these guys.
5535.1,5538.1, They'll shoot you and they'll only a few bolts will kill you.
5538.1,5540.1, It's always about like ambushes.
5540.1,5542.1, All that's counter-striping run stuff.
5542.1,5544.1," Yeah, for them for those guys."
5544.1,5546.1, And that's the problem with counter strike.
5546.1,5547.1, Yes.
5547.1,5549.1, It's brutal if you're new to the game.
5549.1,5552.1, So they're putting in these options where you're still able to move around.
5552.1,5553.1, Because here's the thing.
5553.1,5556.1," When you plan that point of view, you can see through walls."
5556.1,5559.1, You can see the silhouette of the human players.
5559.1,5562.1, And that's what helps you ambush and equalize things.
5562.1,5565.1, It's like so you can kind of plan your attack and advance and know they're about to come through.
5565.1,5568.1, That way you know right when to jump on or something.
5568.1,5573.1, It also letting you sort of move around and decide where I'm going to come in from and whom I'm going to be.
5573.1,5576.1, But just something I definitely do believe they need to give you something to do.
5576.1,5579.1, So if you get caught in the bad end of the loop right as it's rewinding.
5579.1,5580.1, Some set of five seconds.
5580.1,5582.1, You got to wait 20 seconds which is an eternity.
5582.1,5585.1, When you see a bunch of humans running around and having fun.
5585.1,5590.1, You're sitting there waiting for the spot names and other fat boomers.
5590.1,5594.1, You're good to regenerate.
5594.1,5595.1, Hmm.
5595.1,5597.1, Okay.
5597.1,5600.1, I guess that is it for us video game.
5600.1,5603.1, We have time for this week or at a time video games.
5603.1,5604.1, Video games.
5604.1,5605.1, What about them?
5605.1,5606.1, I don't know.
5606.1,5607.1, Video games.
5607.1,5608.1, Okay.
5608.1,5609.1, Alright.
5609.1,5610.1, Mr. Toretz over here.
5610.1,5611.1, Video games.
5611.1,5612.1, Okay.
5612.1,5614.1, Thanks for waiting for us all week.
5614.1,5617.1, This week kids maybe we'll be back earlier next week.
5617.1,5620.1, You get two in quick succession now.
5620.1,5621.1, Hopefully.
5621.1,5622.1, You're for on time.
5622.1,5625.1, And so we'll talk to you next week.
5625.1,5626.1, Good bye.
