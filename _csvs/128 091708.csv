0.0,6.48, Take on the fight as the Vodasal Sergeant Psycho Sikes in a new parallel story taking place
6.48,8.48, during the events of crisis.
8.48,12.16, Psycho Secret Mission will take him to the other side of the island on a ruthless pursuit
12.16,15.84, of a North Korean general help him to obtain path to technology.
15.84,17.44, Are you Psycho enough?
17.44,23.44, Crisis warhead is in store September 18.
30.0,31.0, Be man!
31.0,35.0, Get Shuffin out!
35.0,37.0, We need video data.
37.0,44.519999999999996, We were just saying that the Shuffin out in an expression I was used in the podcast previously
44.519999999999996,48.44, that we would like to make a video of montage of someone shoving it out.
48.44,53.879999999999995, Someone working out and doing Taekwondo and getting beefed up and facing life's challenges.
53.88,60.88, See that's the name of Anthony Smavskat site.
60.88,64.44, Hello and welcome Jeff Green.
64.44,69.44, We'll always be with us but he's not with us right now.
69.44,72.2, This is the final GFW.
72.2,74.4, We're going to be no Gallos humor.
74.4,77.24000000000001, We're just giddy and we're singing.
77.24000000000001,79.96000000000001," Chuffin out, let's get to the way right now."
79.96,83.39999999999999, That's a random point on the podcast.
83.39999999999999,86.0, Bob Edo said that he would wear a shirt that's a chuffin out.
86.0,89.6, So today he's wearing a shirt that says chuffin out.
89.6,92.52, Alan B. from Ireland.
92.52,94.52, From Blarnie Ireland.
94.52,98.83999999999999, He basically made this awesome image of Anthony with the lightsaber.
98.83999999999999,101.39999999999999, Although some people put some kind of Picassoesque abstraction.
101.39999999999999,106.6, Some people pointed out that like you got like a down syndrome on the right side.
106.6,111.11999999999999, It looks fantastic and says chuffin out and says the brodo.
111.11999999999999,113.08, Ninety-seven point five beneath it.
113.08,116.64, My favorite thing about this shirt though and I want to know where he got it is that
116.64,118.64, it's a medium and it fits me really well.
118.64,120.39999999999999, I want to know where that came from.
120.39999999999999,124.19999999999999, I feel like so good about myself that I'm wearing a medium.
124.19999999999999,125.39999999999999, Either things must be true.
125.39999999999999,126.88, It's made for gamers.
126.88,128.4, Their gamer size.
128.4,129.88, I'm a medium size gamer.
129.88,130.88, That's true.
130.88,134.4," When I saw that I've been there, I was assuming that it must be for Anthony or something."
134.48000000000002,135.24, It's like a man.
135.24,136.24, Robert.
136.24,140.0, And Anthony we should say we should tell him be the Anthony's bum that he couldn't
140.0,142.84, wear shirt with himself with the picture himself as a Jedi on it.
142.84,143.84, He got me.
143.84,144.84, You gotta wear it.
144.84,147.48000000000002, Look at how the legs are so skinny but then he still did me justice with you.
147.48000000000002,148.48000000000002, Get a punch.
148.48000000000002,149.48000000000002, Yeah.
149.48000000000002,152.48000000000002, I thought the earring was a good detail.
152.48000000000002,154.48000000000002, I thought that was a good eye.
154.48000000000002,155.48000000000002, He got him both.
155.48000000000002,156.48000000000002, That's how you got him both.
156.48000000000002,160.52, But that's how like what a caricature artist do reduce people to their most like recognizable
160.52,161.52, features.
161.52,162.52, Right.
162.52,167.96," The caricatures he's basically like an Afro and two earring, two gold hoots."
167.96,170.08," If you get that right, you gotta have to be gone."
170.08,171.08, Yeah.
171.08,172.08," Well, Analite Savor."
172.08,173.08, Of course.
173.08,174.08, Yeah.
174.08,179.32000000000002, So first thing I have to apologize for I posted a blog today.
179.32000000000002,181.84, And I probably shouldn't have had said I was leaving.
181.84,184.60000000000002, And that was just more.
184.60000000000002,185.60000000000002, More.
185.60000000000002,186.60000000000002, A dumb joke.
186.60000000000002,187.60000000000002, More grease.
187.60000000000002,188.60000000000002, Wasn't really funny.
188.60000000000002,190.0, Did anyone but myself?
190.0,194.76, I've cried wolf so many times now that I don't know I understand if people can't
194.76,195.76, forgive me.
195.76,196.76," Oh, so."
196.76,197.76, You cried so many people.
197.76,199.76, How scary is it when you cry?
199.76,201.24, Let's just turn it off right there.
201.24,203.24, Fuck that guy then.
203.24,205.24, On the podcast before.
205.24,206.24, So I don't know.
206.24,208.52, We were all against this jik.
208.52,211.04, And I'm going to eat one of these peanut butter flavored corn pops.
211.04,212.04," Well, you eat that."
212.04,214.32," We're going to have, we have new technology here in the office."
214.32,219.48, We've got the ability to receive Collins from listeners and from our friends.
219.48,224.76, So from 4.30 on we're going to be basically having people join us that are calling in
224.76,228.56," some of us or like, like, it's a friends people that worked with us before."
228.56,229.95999999999998, People don't know when 4.30 is.
229.95999999999998,230.95999999999998, Right.
230.95999999999998,231.95999999999998, Yes.
231.95999999999998,232.95999999999998," Well, it's for our time."
232.95999999999998,233.95999999999998, We got no idea.
233.95999999999998,234.95999999999998, It's a while into the show.
234.95999999999998,235.95999999999998," Well, yeah."
235.95999999999998,236.95999999999998, I didn't even say what the date to show is.
236.95999999999998,242.04," So in honor of Jeff, it's the podcast for October 18, 2006."
242.04,245.6, And it's approximately.
245.6,246.6, That's the right.
246.6,248.6, Right now it's 3.45 Pacific time.
248.6,253.64," So, you know, about 45 minutes from now, we're going to start doing some calls."
253.64,257.84," But until then, like, let's talk about the games for playing a guy."
257.84,262.71999999999997, Have you even been playing any PC games these days?
262.71999999999997,264.52, We got to do an all kinds of reviews.
264.52,265.52, Yeah.
265.52,268.08, I've sort of hung up on sport.
268.08,273.8," I haven't played beyond the creature stage because I picked herbivore, which is apparently"
273.8,277.12, very stupid move.
277.12,282.92," And I did start playing an XCOM UFO defense on Steam, which is a very old school game,"
282.92,286.36, a few of my friends have claimed that that was their favorite game of all time.
286.36,288.16, So I've been trying to figure that out.
288.16,294.84000000000003," It started out with me spending like 4 hours reading the manual, which is always a good"
294.84000000000003,296.36, way to start playing a game.
296.36,297.76, But I'm sort of getting it.
297.76,299.08, It's a really difficult game.
299.08,302.56," You know, it's like basically an everything game."
302.56,309.56," It's part strategy, part strategy action, part like, you know, sim city style, like building"
309.56,311.56, a UFO research structure.
311.56,315.4, It's got all these various things you can do that have to do with like repelling an alien
315.4,316.4, invasion.
316.4,318.4, I don't know if any of you guys have ever played it.
318.4,319.4, I've not.
319.4,320.4, I've always heard good things.
320.4,321.4, Yeah.
321.4,322.4, Right.
322.4,324.4, Never was an XCOM.
324.4,325.4, Yeah.
325.4,326.76," Well, we never tried them."
326.76,328.68," It's fairly, it's fairly beyond me."
328.68,332.44, And you basically like shoot down UFOs that come into your territory and then you have
332.44,337.84, to go explore the crash site and fight aliens and gain their technology and then use that
337.84,341.84, technology to create your own anti-alien equipment.
341.84,346.4, Only I'm on the second crash site and I've played it tried playing it like five times and
346.4,352.15999999999997, they just woke the shit out of me and I have no idea how to get better at the game.
352.15999999999997,353.88," But anyway, that's yeah."
353.88,355.72, We can bring a tie to that.
355.72,360.96, I tried to play the tragically titled Bangalore Spirit.
360.96,362.36, Oh my god.
362.36,364.36, I thought I heard good things about that.
364.36,365.36, I didn't.
365.36,366.36, I'm not even saying it's bad.
366.36,367.68, I haven't said anything bad about it.
367.68,369.36, Were you saying you thought you heard good things about me?
369.36,370.36, I'm just talking.
370.36,373.36," No, I just said I tried to play it."
373.36,374.36, I didn't say it was bad.
374.36,375.36, Yeah.
375.36,376.36, I'm trying to play it.
376.36,377.36, That implies bad.
377.36,378.36, Put them play as I'm bad.
378.36,382.36," Well, the thing is with this game is treasure developed it."
382.36,385.96000000000004," And the whole concept when you pick up the box, you look at the back of the box."
385.96000000000004,391.36," You have no idea what variety of game this is, who it's for, how it functions."
391.36,395.16," I mean, you're able to trade content levels that you make through audio and stuff."
395.16,399.36, All these things that the manual is cryptic and I don't know if it's poorly translated or
399.36,403.64, just they assume that kind of like we assume that people listening to the podcast like
403.64,406.44, know everything about that we've ever said on the previous podcast.
406.44,407.68," It's like, sure."
407.68,412.36," You could tell that they just were like, hey, if you picked this up, it was made for you."
412.36,413.36, And you get it.
413.36,416.24," And it's kind of like, I mean, when you, this is a puzzle game, right, right."
416.24,421.32," But where you're a Mac and you're fighting in these, you know, like,"
421.32,425.32," you're not just single screen, you're, but you're fighting in these, these very specific"
425.32,429.32, scenarios against sometimes an overwhelming number of enemies that are firing hundreds of
429.32,433.32," missiles each to the point that like the DS, the slowdown is insane."
433.32,437.32," There's some of the levels designed under treasures, best categories."
437.32,441.32," There's like puzzles, treasures, best, which are their favorites, some other categories."
441.32,445.32, Or the game goes to like three frames a second because there's so many missiles coming
445.32,446.32, at you on screen.
446.32,450.32, And your experience when you first start the game is that you spawn suddenly see a thousand
450.32,453.32, coming out you and then you blow up and die.
453.32,456.32," And then at first it's, you hit replay."
456.32,461.32," Technically that's not the first level of that you know, may have accidentally gone to that"
461.32,462.32," level, but it starts."
462.32,463.32, That was like simpler than that.
463.32,464.32, That's the third or something.
464.32,465.32, Yeah.
465.32,466.32," And that real fast, yeah."
466.32,467.32, Yeah.
467.32,469.32," And then there's the button that's like, you know, replay."
469.32,473.32," And instead of for some reason, instead of thinking like, I'm going to see a replay of what"
473.32,477.32," I just did, how I just failed, I'm going to replay the level."
477.32,478.32, So I kept doing that.
478.32,481.32," And because we're talking about a five second bit of gameplay that it took me to blow up,"
481.32,483.32, I thought I was playing again and losing.
483.32,488.32," And I didn't have six fucking times in a row before I realized, like, do this fucking thing"
488.32,489.32, doesn't even work.
489.32,491.32," I'm pressing up, like, gang, gang, gang."
491.32,494.32," And then I was like, oh, I guess that's not the right button."
494.32,499.32, So when I started to get the crazy thing is that you basically just thrown in there and you
499.32,502.32, have to figure out maybe the solution in that case with a hundred missiles coming at you
502.32,506.32," sit, you throw up a shield real quick or you have a bat and you can like knock some back at"
506.32,507.32, you.
507.32,510.32, And you have to do a dash attack to cut through the tiny escape and then do like a reflect
510.32,511.32, power or some other thing.
511.32,515.3199999999999," But it's really, really, you got to use your crazy super power."
515.3199999999999,520.3199999999999," The thing that I just gained though is like each level, you're allowed to pick, you know,"
520.3199999999999,523.3199999999999," from this, this big list of weapons, right?"
523.3199999999999,525.3199999999999, What's going to take into the stage?
525.3199999999999,528.3199999999999," But the game doesn't give you any sort of advice, like you might want to take this."
528.3199999999999,530.3199999999999, You might have the wrong loadout.
530.3199999999999,531.3199999999999, You might not.
531.3199999999999,532.3199999999999, Pick your stuff like that.
532.3199999999999,535.3199999999999, You're just playing the level with the power that you need to get through there.
535.32,536.32, Yeah.
536.32,537.32," So, you know, you pick the loadout."
537.32,538.32," I mean, and this is kind of a cool thing."
538.32,542.32, I admire for the people that can do this because it is cool when you beat that level.
542.32,544.32," And I'm like, holy shit, how did I do that?"
544.32,548.32," It's kind of got some, you know, it shares a lot in common in an abstract sense with trials"
548.32,549.32, too that we talked about before.
549.32,552.32, The motor cross game where it's just brutally difficult.
552.32,558.32," And at the same time, you continue to play it because the smallest increment in progress, you"
558.32,560.32," know, half a screen distance more to the right."
560.32,563.32," You feel as though you've done something and that's enough to keep you going for the next,"
563.32,565.32," you know, two feet more progress."
565.32,569.32," And this game is like, yeah, it's just, it's just mind-boggling to me."
569.32,574.32," And it's also cool that people are able to make this, the equivalent of like a love letter or like a,"
574.32,577.32," just like their own a project for themselves, you know, I mean,"
577.32,581.32," yeah, there's no way that if someone, I don't even know how you pick it."
581.32,584.32," You go to the store and you're like, well, this one's got a robot on the front."
584.32,585.32, Grabbing this one.
585.32,589.32," I think it is for fans of Bongaio, not that it was a huge game,"
589.32,594.32, but I happen to be a big fan of the original game for Dreamcast.
594.32,600.32, And it's weird to me what the DS game is because I didn't read about it necessarily before it came out.
600.32,605.32, I just knew that Bongaio was coming out for DS and I had imagined that it would be like a port of the original.
605.32,607.32," And I was like, oh, yeah, here it comes."
607.32,610.32, And the original was the traditional side-scalent.
610.32,616.32, It was more like a craziest action game anyone has ever fucking made.
616.32,620.32," Like it's not, it's in no way a puzzle game really."
620.32,625.32," It was all about putting like, you know, 500 enemies on the screen and enormous sawsing missiles."
625.32,636.32," Yeah, causing like giant explosions because the thing, the sort of cool thing in the game is that the number of explosions on the screen relates directly to how big your, like giant power up is,"
636.32,641.32," which is that, you know, trigger button, you know, kill everything in the room,"
641.32,645.32, explosion of missiles that comes out of your body toward everyone.
645.32,651.32, Right. And you would sort of like create these situations where lots of things would explode so that you could explode even more things.
651.32,653.32, And the game would slow down to like two frames of that.
653.32,656.32, Did you watch Robotech at a curiosity as a kid?
656.32,658.32," No, no. I'm not, I'm not a wise."
658.32,664.32," I'm not like, I don't like the game in any way, like relating to Max or any of that shit."
664.32,668.32," Well, there's that, like really simple aspect of Robotech that was super cool when I was kid."
668.32,672.32, And it's like all the missile base on these like ships would open up.
672.32,677.32, And like hundreds and hundreds would come out and they'd all streak across the stream and he should have a toned vapor trail.
677.32,684.32, And I remember playing toys as a like a very retarded little kid and kind of like spasticly like sputtering my fingers out.
684.32,691.32," Like imagine like a toned his own missile and then you just take your like, you kind of like spas claw hands like."
691.32,694.32, And I was tacked with the audience.
694.32,695.32, I think it's like a bit of a vision.
695.32,699.32," Yeah, you definitely see it's like just the jazz hands, but like something going wrong."
699.32,701.32, It's a little hands suddenly getting a cramp.
701.32,704.32," But yeah, like the just the, that many missiles flying in school."
704.32,709.32, But the new version of the game is all I want to say is like it's very very different.
709.32,716.32," I mean, the original game sort of had independent aiming and movement, you know, like all like Robotron or geometry wars."
716.32,722.32, And the DS game has this pretty convoluted system for controlling things and it's on a much smaller scale.
722.32,725.32, Like it's all these like like you said they're almost single screen levels.
725.32,729.32," They're pretty small, not just one screen, but like a couple or three maybe."
729.32,734.32, And they're very much about like solving the puzzle of how you get through the area.
734.32,739.32, But the original game was just a crazy ball to the wall action game.
739.32,746.32, And the most amazing thing about it was that it had one of the most infamously bad translations that treasure ever did.
746.32,752.32, For a company that is infamous for bad localization and bad translation.
752.32,755.32, Bungaio was amazingly bad.
755.32,761.32," Like each level was almost like a punchline and that you would, I mean each level was called Bungaio."
761.32,764.32, It's released and this is Bungaio on the box.
764.32,767.32," Yeah, imagine imagine fighting for each shelf space."
767.32,769.32, Got the fucking Bungaio on the box.
769.32,773.32," Yeah, like so yeah, you don't have to convince me that they had some trouble inside the game."
773.32,780.32," But the whole thing, the whole game like every level was like a joke and you would play through the level and you'd get to the end and talk to somebody."
780.32,785.32," And that would be the punchlines of the joke because it would just be some inane, non-secretor."
785.32,787.32, Like we're glad that you visited us.
787.32,788.32, Vegetables are delicious.
788.32,790.32, They're like okay.
790.32,793.32, But they changed that in the new one.
793.32,794.32, And I don't like change.
794.32,797.32," Yeah, I don't, I don't want to say about it other than I can't condemn."
797.32,800.32, I mean like I admire it for what it is.
801.32,803.32," Yeah, I would probably, I also picked up this other game."
803.32,806.32, It's a total metal-slug clone and it's called like Commandos Something.
806.32,808.32, It's another DS game.
808.32,809.32, I was helpful for that.
809.32,810.32, And I already brought it back in.
810.32,815.32," I mean it looks good and everything but the problem for me there is that it's got, like you can't,"
815.32,820.32, it's not like infinite continues or whatever you have to like get through an award and then continue progress.
820.32,823.32," Like when I was trying to play it on the bar with the local train here home,"
823.32,826.32, it's very difficult to pay absolute attention to it.
826.32,827.32, And there's a lot of stuff happening.
827.32,831.32," Like from the very beginning, you're shooting guys in the sky and trying to jump over mines."
831.32,835.32, And I'm just got like a moon patrol vibe for the very first half of the first level.
835.32,837.32, And it's like a died pretty easily.
837.32,840.32, And I got to the end of the level on the boss and I died and it was like over again.
840.32,842.32," I was like, I don't really want to do that again."
842.32,844.32, But where is with Bungaio?
844.32,845.32, Bungaio?
845.32,846.32, Bungaio?
846.32,852.32," If I fail it so like to fail so quickly and you might win so quickly by finding, you know,"
852.32,855.32," there's a chance that you will stumble across, you know,"
855.32,860.32, upon some just like brilliant solution to the action puzzle.
860.32,861.32, You know what you got to do?
861.32,864.32, I think a more interesting continuing to play.
864.32,867.32," Bungaio than, I was going to do it."
867.32,869.32, It's like you already did it.
869.32,872.32," You got it, you know, when you get to that part of the game, you know what you got to do."
872.32,874.32, You just got to check for that.
874.32,878.32," You know, there's a part of every game where you come to the top of the road to run."
878.32,881.32," And it's like, are you going to give up? Are you going to take this back to EB Games?"
881.32,884.32, Or are you going to chuff it the fuck out?
884.32,888.32," You know, I'm totally ready for the be like a message board meme for us."
888.32,892.32," Yes, like someone comes on and they're complaining like in the NeoGap off topic."
892.32,895.32, Like my girlfriend broke up with me over my porn.
895.32,897.32," You know, one of those and like I just showed off it."
897.32,898.32, Chuff it out.
898.32,903.32, I've tell me you need to go to like some one of those like wacky t-shirt websites with this idea.
903.32,907.32," When I saw this shirt, the thing that I realized that I think we were completely"
907.32,911.32, ignorant enough is we really should have been making merchandise this all time.
911.32,916.32," Well, one up has their shwag shop, but it has a bunch of, uh, quite a lot of things."
916.32,917.32, It's not actually that much.
917.32,918.32, It's not actually that much.
918.32,919.32," Yeah, it's not actually that much."
919.32,922.32," But I mean, if we had used like cafe press and stuff to try to make some, you know,"
922.32,928.32," timely shirts that related to things that were sort of, uh, hits that people were talking about now."
928.32,932.32," And then, yeah, it would have been cool, you know, people would have bought that."
932.32,936.32," You mean like we could have, by cool, you mean we could have had money to go do shit for fun?"
936.32,938.32," Yeah, man, we could have made some money."
938.32,941.32, If we sold five fucking shirts in cafe press.
941.32,946.32," We could have, I don't know, you've been, you've been getting, you've been getting, you've been getting the CD"
946.32,949.32, doctor that one that teaches you how to like sell.
949.32,950.32, I was a big bitch.
950.32,953.32, So open your own online store.
953.32,956.32," Today, we're going to tell you how to make money on cafe press."
956.32,959.32," First, come up with an insult for George W. Bush."
959.32,961.32," Second, print."
961.32,964.32, Now you own money.
964.32,969.32, I'm the guy that makes learning to make money easy.
969.32,975.32," Ryan, before we stop talking about Bangayo, I know you played it."
975.32,979.32," Yeah, I didn't really get into it."
979.32,980.32, Why is that Ryan?
980.32,983.32," Don't make me, because I had the same horrible experience."
983.32,987.32," I had the same horrible experience you did, but that doesn't make me want to keep going."
987.32,988.32, You didn't check it out.
988.32,993.32," Like now, I couldn't even finish all the tutorial levels."
993.32,996.32," I mean, there were tutorial levels that did this, and like I couldn't."
996.32,997.32," Yeah, but you didn't do it."
997.32,999.32, I'm pretty ball breaking games.
999.32,1001.32, You're playing Mega Man 9.
1001.32,1002.32, Yeah.
1002.32,1004.32," No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
1004.32,1005.32, That's not.
1005.32,1007.32, That's something that I'm used to.
1007.32,1010.32," I know what to expect from this game, and I know."
1010.32,1014.32, Are you like video games in the way that you are with food?
1014.32,1015.32, Everyone is.
1015.32,1018.32, Do you mean you just have to read this business?
1018.32,1023.32," Because Ryan only eats what would, you know, qualify as comfort food to him."
1023.32,1024.3200000000002, You talked about before.
1024.3200000000002,1025.3200000000002, Peanut bird jelly sandwich.
1025.3200000000002,1029.3200000000002," If he goes to subway, he gets the bread and then piece of meat and cheese and nothing on it."
1029.3200000000002,1030.3200000000002," Yeah, well, it's okay."
1030.3200000000002,1034.3200000000002," Look, it's kind of like that one time when that Asian girl came up to Ryan."
1034.3200000000002,1036.3200000000002," You know, and he came and talks to us all about it."
1036.3200000000002,1037.3200000000002, And he thought she was really cool.
1037.3200000000002,1038.3200000000002, But Ryan doesn't know.
1038.3200000000002,1040.3200000000002, It has to be white girls or bust for a while.
1040.3200000000002,1041.3200000000002," Oh, you are."
1041.3200000000002,1043.3200000000002, I was not seeing that coming.
1043.3200000000002,1044.3200000000002, I'm so very in.
1044.3200000000002,1045.3200000000002, I didn't see that coming.
1045.3200000000002,1047.3200000000002, I don't know what you're talking about.
1047.32,1050.32, But all the dogs are not long enough.
1050.32,1051.32, Wow.
1051.32,1052.32," So, okay."
1052.32,1055.32," But so, Ben and I own Ben and I know both difficult games."
1055.32,1059.32," But, and I was, I was remarking on this earlier today's somebody else."
1059.32,1066.32," But I like difficult games when the mechanics are like very clear, well defined, like simple rules."
1066.32,1069.32," Like, man, you can jump and you can shoot."
1069.32,1073.32," Ben and I have like, you know, pick weapon A and pick weapon B."
1073.32,1076.32, And you can fuse them together with the shoulder buttons.
1076.32,1078.32," You know, there's like 10 different weapons or something."
1078.32,1081.32," He doesn't give you any help, but it's basically a game of trial and error."
1081.32,1084.32," Or, you know, you hit star going level in your dead in two seconds."
1084.32,1086.32," Yeah, but do you have a do you have?"
1086.32,1091.32," How do you know how do you know, you know, that when you get to the end of, you know,"
1091.32,1098.32," tree man that you don't need long man's weapon to kill him and Mega Man, you know how to figure that out."
1098.32,1100.32, That's try through trial and error.
1100.32,1101.32, Yeah.
1101.32,1105.32," But it's, I'm, I'm, I'm, it's simply the mechanics of the game."
1105.32,1117.32," Yeah, we're just, we're just, we're just, we're the one thing the bongaier does that is hilarious to me is that you play the tutorial, which is pretty elaborate."
1117.32,1121.32," Honestly, it must be like 18 little tutorial levels because it's a complicated game."
1121.32,1126.32," I believe when you read those when you finish the tutorial, they roll the credits."
1126.32,1128.32," They're like, that was a really good game."
1128.32,1130.32, Thanks for buying it.
1131.32,1136.32," Or did I never see anyone do that before? It's a great joke. I mean, they roll it like dramatic credits and everything."
1136.32,1137.32, Nice.
1137.32,1138.32, Yeah.
1138.32,1143.32," But, um, make a man that I can't say much about that, but it's good."
1143.32,1145.32, It's an NES game in 2008.
1145.32,1147.32, Why can't you say much about it?
1147.32,1151.32, It's an Embar is a fucking Mega Man retro as we wear game under a bargaret.
1151.32,1152.32, I believe it.
1152.32,1158.32," Dude, you can't talk about the one part we fucking jump over like a peanut that comes out of his shells."
1158.32,1163.32, You can't talk about how you keep on falling off the disappearing platform.
1163.32,1166.32," Dude, hey, this is where platforms aren't that bad."
1166.32,1167.32, Okay.
1167.32,1172.32," Did you see that, like, promotional thing that I saw it on a blog earlier today,"
1172.32,1175.32, they were sending out like fake cartridges for Mega Man 9.
1175.32,1177.32," Yeah, it was like a cartridge."
1177.32,1178.32," Yeah, I heard about that."
1178.32,1183.32," And inside the cartridge, it was a case for a CD or something, and I'm sure it was just like a press kit or something, but it was kind of amazing."
1183.32,1189.32, It would be cool if it actually could send the game on a cartridge that you could play in your NES.
1189.32,1190.32, That would have been amazing.
1190.32,1191.32, Yeah.
1191.32,1192.32, Would that be wonderful?
1192.32,1193.32, I played that game.
1193.32,1198.32," I figure that if I don't know how this game was like programmed or whatever, but I figure if it is,"
1198.32,1206.32," basically a NES game that could work in that format, somebody will figure out some way to make a ROM of Mega Man 9."
1206.32,1207.32, That would be cool.
1207.32,1211.32," Unfortunately, what you don't know is that Mega Man 9 runs on Unreal 3."
1211.32,1213.32," Oh, that was that is."
1213.32,1214.32, Yeah.
1214.32,1222.32," I think that's what we're also going to have to talk about sport because unless you guys have had some time with your stock or clear sky or crisis,"
1222.32,1225.32," we're head both are out now, but we didn't get copies."
1225.32,1230.32," Well, actually we got one copy retail copy of Clear Sky in."
1230.32,1235.32," And unfortunately, I'm going to be, I mean, I know I'm looking forward to playing those from tonight on,"
1235.32,1238.32," but I mean, if you guys get to play."
1238.32,1239.32, No.
1239.32,1240.32, No.
1240.32,1241.32, I didn't get to be on the show.
1241.32,1243.32, So how about that sport?
1243.32,1244.32, Yeah.
1244.32,1246.32, I'm up to the tribal phase.
1246.32,1252.32, I'm approximately 15 minutes beyond where I was last time we talked about sport on the podcast.
1252.32,1253.32, Yeah.
1253.32,1254.32," Well, yeah."
1254.32,1255.32, And I'm where you are.
1255.32,1257.32, I'm probably where you are now.
1257.32,1258.32, Yeah.
1258.32,1259.32, Wow.
1259.32,1261.32, So the deal for me with that.
1261.32,1263.32, I want to keep going.
1263.32,1267.32," But yeah, it's the creature phase is not so fun."
1267.32,1271.32," I mean, I'm that sucks because I think that's the best one too."
1271.32,1273.32," So really, if you don't think that's fun."
1273.32,1279.32, That my my take on the game so far is that it's it's basically a way to teach.
1279.32,1284.32," Do you get people acclimated to the conventions of a proper MMO, but in a casual space."
1284.32,1290.32," So for example, what happens in the creature phases, you learn about a party about forming a party where it's like you just have a couple of their"
1290.32,1295.32, species members join you and you learn about questing and grinding.
1295.32,1298.32, It's that there's only one and that's like you go to another nest.
1298.32,1304.32," And if you're a number four, you play Simon says until they all are happy and you get you make for them happy."
1304.32,1307.32," And then that quest is done and you get some XP, which is evolution points."
1307.32,1312.32," Or if you're kind of where you go and fight them all and then when you fight them, it's very much like an MMO."
1312.32,1316.32," You know, you have your test, your your special power bar down on the bottom."
1316.32,1320.32," Or normally you press your F keys if you were playing, you know, work after something and you."
1320.32,1323.32, You click on bite and stuff and it's much like an MMO.
1323.32,1333.32, There's no the animations all out of sync. You'll constantly just do this bite animation. You'll clip through them and they'll do their attack and if you got spikes on your tail.
1333.32,1337.32," It's a matter. I mean, you're not like whipping with your tail or anything like that."
1337.32,1342.32," And it's just this really static thing. And so for me, what's happening is you just go around him."
1342.32,1347.32," Once you kill four at one nest, you go around to the next nest and kill four more and you do that and you do that."
1347.32,1352.32, And then eventually you rank up and so this is the kind of game you hate and they're far.
1352.32,1362.32," It is, but minus the multiplayer aspect. I mean, say the multiplayer aspects there in the form of seeing creatures other people made, but not in the social aspect of like let's make this interesting."
1362.32,1373.32," Let's do this together or whatever. Let's go beat up and let's know that this isn't just a nest of another four bots, but it's someone that like came into this game with all these principles about how they're going to be this wonderful"
1373.32,1380.32," Orbore that evolved into like a highly, you know, theistic species and like let's just go over there and like crap in their nest or something, you know."
1380.32,1387.32," I mean, it was never advertised as that kind of game, but I'm just saying like yeah, it's even more it's even less interesting to me than like an"
1387.32,1389.32, A typical amount of because of that.
1389.32,1399.32," And the other, the other thing about that is just like I see that because you get the DNA and it's a equivalent of loot and loot drops."
1399.32,1405.32," It's like, ah, you picked up instead of like turbo gauntlet, you pick up the turbo scale or spike or something."
1405.32,1417.32," And like if you're not used to all that, and those conventions and other games, maybe that's there, like say, you know, your little brother or sister, like, and that's their first real experience with loot drops and grinding and"
1417.32,1424.32," Never like, yeah, this is totally, you know, fun. I can't stop. I can't stop playing this because I want to get the next DNA drop or something."
1424.32,1430.32," And I mean, which is to say, it's for I think it's for someone else other than me, you know."
1430.32,1434.32," Yeah, I mean, I was just thinking about that guy earlier today out in front of the office."
1434.32,1437.32," It was like, we were talking about video games and he just brought up sport."
1437.32,1438.32," Yeah, yeah."
1438.32,1439.32, Some random dude out there.
1439.32,1447.32," You know, like how wild rights have been talking about, well, on MPR and stuff, he's like, this game was really hopeful that it will inspire a generation of future scientists."
1447.32,1448.32, Yeah.
1448.32,1453.32," Like that's, he has to dig about it, whether or not you believe that, but I actually think that maybe if anything, it will inspire"
1453.32,1462.32," like a new generation of maybe game developers in the sense that games like that are a little big planet that let you do and create on a easy way, maybe it will get people to be like, man,"
1462.32,1466.32, Maybe I really would like to make games because they start seeing how things animate and stuff like that.
1466.32,1469.32, Like I think I don't add some point though. Let's take the difference.
1469.32,1472.32," There's always, I mean, I don't know, I'll play devil's advocate."
1472.32,1479.32," I've made it my mind on this, but there's always an ability to mod a game or do all these things into to spark that same interest."
1479.32,1486.32," Isn't this kind of like saying that a color book is responsible for the future, you know, Picasso's other world."
1486.32,1490.32," We got, you know, we showed you how fun it is to color in those lines."
1490.32,1493.32," Yeah, I got choice. You could make a green or could have been a purple."
1493.32,1495.32, I guess I didn't want to color green on for me.
1495.32,1502.32, I guess I just think that art is easier to like go and jump into than game design because game design the tools are hard enough to make.
1502.32,1506.32," So when someone provides the tools for you to do it yourself, you can put what a thing."
1506.32,1508.32, What then about game design would support you to?
1508.32,1516.32," I don't know, I'm not saying it would teach you anything. I'm just saying it would interest you in it in the sense that why like making these these things that could then get animated into the game."
1516.32,1517.32, Maybe I would like that for a living.
1517.32,1523.32," That much more than changing like, within like finding silver died and guild wars and making a new color."
1523.32,1524.32, Yeah.
1524.32,1525.32," Can you like, caper something?"
1525.32,1527.32, I think it's totally different.
1527.32,1528.32, Yeah.
1528.32,1529.32, Okay.
1529.32,1531.32, But because you see something animated and have a life of its own unlike.
1531.32,1536.32," I mean, I could see someone more being inspired to be like a 3D artist in sport."
1536.32,1541.32, Because that's really more of like the set of things that you work with.
1541.32,1547.32, And that's something that is definitely difficult to get into at the level of sport quickly.
1547.32,1550.32," You know, to be able to like quickly make characters and definitely people are into that."
1550.32,1558.32," But you know, as far as like making characters, I think you can't you can't make a creature with a with a gun for an arm and a robot leg."
1558.32,1561.32," Yo, it's never going to teach any game artists."
1561.32,1563.32, It's never going to happen.
1564.32,1566.32," See, there's no advisors."
1566.32,1567.32, It's serious.
1567.32,1568.32, Yeah.
1568.32,1569.32, It's serious.
1569.32,1572.32," Although I guess to play devil, that would hit with myself."
1572.32,1576.32, I don't think games like second life or anything inspired people to go on to do character design.
1576.32,1579.32," And they should because in second life, you need to see that he thinks you want."
1579.32,1580.32, Yeah.
1580.32,1583.32, Second life only inspires people in master base.
1583.32,1585.32, Second life is like a box of plato.
1585.32,1590.32," Yeah, I've seen four is a box of plato that you have to put in."
1590.32,1592.32," Yeah, it's not like a box of plato."
1592.32,1594.32, It's not like a box of plato with like the super friends mold or the store's ones.
1594.32,1595.32, Like you can maybe just say.
1595.32,1597.32," No, you don't play though."
1597.32,1598.32, They used to maybe just.
1598.32,1599.32, No.
1599.32,1607.32, Remember to be like a mold and you put the plato in there and you stamp it and you get like a little play to like see three PO or something.
1607.32,1609.32," Hell yeah, I had the go spusters one."
1609.32,1610.32, Like what did you do with that?
1610.32,1613.32, They all every when you make a play to figure.
1613.32,1617.32," Yeah, they all like are going to get smushed or blown apart or like in your case."
1617.32,1622.32, It's like so it's like so it's a little more open than that come on.
1622.32,1625.32," Oh no, because you don't have to do that."
1625.32,1626.32," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
1626.32,1627.32," I mean, I've seen a great stuff."
1627.32,1634.32," I think actually like the thing that I need to do with that game to enjoy it more is to find, you know,"
1634.32,1637.32, 20 people who are making cool things.
1637.32,1644.32," That's what I have gone friends, you know, who I can be surprised by the stuff that I run into in the game and delighted."
1644.32,1646.32, Surprised and delighted.
1646.32,1647.32, Yeah.
1647.32,1649.32," Instead of running into the sort of art,"
1649.32,1654.32," arty created stuff that's on there and the, and the sort of bad things that have been uploading."
1654.32,1659.32, For those people that really like get the enjoyment out of making the creatures and stuff.
1659.32,1660.32, It's fantastic.
1660.32,1664.32, And then and that's why I think the fact that they're able to sell the creature creator on its own.
1664.32,1665.32, Right.
1665.32,1667.32," Speaks volumes about I mean,"
1667.32,1673.32, that the two are you that you can separate them and that you I mean that and it's like if you're not that into if you're not.
1673.32,1677.32," Saying, you know, I really want to invest in this creator and see what I can produce with it."
1677.32,1680.32," The game itself is not going to, I mean,"
1680.32,1684.32, as far as you separate the game from the creation of creatures it's not really going to.
1684.32,1685.32," Yeah, I guess you're right."
1685.32,1694.32, It really the game whole game really is just a single player MMO that's an excuse to find time to use the creature creator for building ships building your house is building everything.
1694.32,1695.32, Yeah.
1695.32,1699.32," You know what I, I could really see expansions for that game though, being kind of surprising."
1699.32,1701.32," You know, when you see expansions for the Sims,"
1701.32,1708.32," it's usually like new behaviors that a Sim could do new new, you know, going out on dates or going on vacation or whatever new objects to get to."
1708.32,1709.32, Yeah.
1709.32,1720.32," Whereas with sport, I could see it being like actually new games like take your sport characters and put them in this new game situation like entirely different things change the entire rules of favor."
1720.32,1721.32, Yeah.
1721.32,1722.32, Yeah.
1722.32,1730.32," Then make because, you know, you talked about in a story you did for one up about like some of the prototype stuff where there was originally a phase where you're forming planets with, you know,"
1730.32,1737.32, using gravity and all these other factors and how it's simulating all these other interesting things that they ultimately make in the game.
1737.32,1747.32," They could then reintroduce those types of games and that kind of gameplay, but then now, but without risking alienating the audience that they're chasing now with the game that did come out."
1747.32,1748.32, Yeah.
1748.32,1750.32," I mean, I guess then you could fragmented, but then it doesn't matter."
1750.32,1754.32, It's like an infinitely customizable sport where you do different things with or maybe it'll be boring.
1754.32,1759.32," And it's just like, here's, here's the secretures expansion or something else I mentioned like,"
1759.32,1763.32," I mean, you can really do far out stuff and since it will's in the sci-fi."
1763.32,1769.32," I mean, you know, you have like parallel universes and stuff like what happens if there's a pack where it introduces like words really screwy."
1769.32,1770.32, Yeah.
1770.32,1776.32, It's like whole different sets of physics and it goes in a definitely science fiction even more so it is.
1776.32,1787.32," I mean, I could see it like abandoning, you know, the scientific aspect and the whole, you know, exploring the universe thing and just doing sport Olympics, you know,"
1787.32,1797.32," what happens when when you put your, your aliens up against your friends aliens, you know, and races and, you know, things like that."
1797.32,1802.32," Just, you know, different games, it would be like your sport creatures are like me's or something."
1802.32,1805.32," Sorry, we're distracted because there's someone trying to come into the room."
1805.32,1806.32, Really?
1806.32,1807.32, It's really the wall.
1807.32,1809.32," Oh, because we're like, that was like, what's going on over there?"
1809.32,1811.32, We're going to have to take a break right now.
1811.32,1813.32, So let's get that out of the way.
1813.32,1822.32, Take on the fight as the volatile sergeant psychoscikes in a new parallel story taking place during the events of crisis.
1822.32,1829.32, Psycho-secret mission will take him to the other side of the island on a ruthless pursuit of the North Korean general helping to obtain pop technology.
1829.32,1831.32, Are you psych enough?
1831.32,1834.32, Crisis warhead is in the store of September 18.
1836.32,1838.32, Sean is such an asshole.
1839.32,1843.32, Why did you come on here until everyone that you weren't leaving?
1843.32,1844.32, I don't know.
1844.32,1846.32, I thought that would be funny.
1846.32,1849.32," Who, uh, audience at home with it funny?"
1849.32,1850.32, Sean is actually leaving.
1850.32,1852.32," Are you laughing, man?"
1852.32,1854.32, The whole point is that he's just-
1854.32,1855.32, He now knows what he knows.
1855.32,1856.32, He just is caught.
1856.32,1859.32," Yeah, he gets this convoluted as the, it's David Fincher, right?"
1859.32,1860.32, The director.
1860.32,1862.32, He made the movie called the game.
1862.32,1863.32, Yeah.
1863.32,1865.32," And the whole notion with that was that someone is,"
1865.32,1867.32," what, how would you break it down?"
1867.32,1869.32," Someone, someone pays to play a game."
1869.32,1873.32," And, but the conditions are the game, or that you don't necessarily know you're in a game."
1873.32,1877.32, And it's basically like you're fighting to survive and you have all sorts of action.
1877.32,1879.32, You basically turn your life into an action movie.
1879.32,1883.32, The kind of the kind of life that most of us won't experience and leave to tell about.
1883.32,1884.32, But then it constantly flips it.
1884.32,1885.32, Is it a game?
1885.32,1886.32, Or is it real?
1886.32,1887.32, What's that difference?
1887.32,1889.32, I know I'm being followed by invisible men.
1889.32,1890.32, Life is good.
1890.32,1892.32, Why am I so miserable then?
1892.32,1897.32," So it keeps going, like, it keeps flipping back and forth and at the end you're like,"
1897.32,1900.32," you know what, I don't give a fuck if this is real or if it's a game."
1900.32,1902.32," So like, I kind of just do one that."
1902.32,1903.32, Okay.
1903.32,1905.32," So you want to make everyone just, I give a fuck."
1905.32,1906.32, No.
1906.32,1907.32, I don't know.
1907.32,1909.32," So yeah, I am leaving."
1909.32,1911.32," And I don't know, man."
1911.32,1912.32, Now it's awkward now.
1912.32,1914.32, I get to feel like Jeff did last week.
1914.32,1918.32," I, like, I guess I could talk about the good stuff first and say where I'm going."
1918.32,1921.32, I'm joining 2K Boston.
1921.32,1929.32," Yeah, the team that produced a created by a shock and I will be a associate producer on the project."
1929.32,1933.32, And it's a pretty interesting structure over there.
1933.32,1939.32, Everyone continually reminds reminds me that it's a Ameritocracy and a Fogos well.
1939.32,1942.32," Then I will learn a great deal about design and the other aspects of, you know,"
1942.32,1947.32, getting creation in the process and hopefully be doing a whole lot of fun stuff.
1947.32,1952.32, So can you confirm that he is making the new Spider-Man?
1952.32,1953.32, That I can confirm it.
1953.32,1955.32, They let me say one thing.
1955.32,1958.32," They're like, you don't give any details just say that it's the new Spider-Man."
1958.32,1959.32, And it's another track.
1959.32,1961.32, So it's not.
1961.32,1963.32, I can't say anything about what it's going to be.
1963.32,1964.32, And that's going to be the difficult part.
1964.32,1965.32, So you have it.
1965.32,1966.32, But it might be Spider-Man.
1966.32,1967.32, It's not going to be Spider-Man.
1967.32,1968.32, I can tell you that.
1968.32,1969.32, It's not going to be Spider-Man.
1969.32,1972.32," The fuck, shit."
1972.32,1976.32," So yeah, I mean, every time you, every time you find Mary,"
1976.32,1979.32," you have to, you know, harvest or save."
1979.32,1982.32, So now it's shit.
1982.32,1984.32, I want other people to talk.
1984.32,1985.32, But I don't want to say it.
1985.32,1988.32," It's just, this is like, it's going to be your exit interview."
1988.32,1993.32," I'm still kind of like, figuring out that this is all real myself."
1993.32,1995.32, Everything's happening so quickly.
1995.32,1997.32," And like, I mean, this is another reason why I wasn't able to play games."
1997.32,2002.32," I've been looking for, you know, to relocate in the Boston area and have a big,"
2002.32,2005.32," you know, logistical issues ahead of me before I jump in and"
2005.32,2008.32," but I mean, I'm really super excited."
2008.32,2012.32," I mean, it's like, I've always felt like I've done best when in just different phases"
2012.32,2016.32, and life when I go to something new and I have to prove myself all over again.
2016.32,2019.32," And in the past, that's meant like going from one college to another,"
2019.32,2022.32, going to grad school or something and then joining a GM.
2022.32,2025.32," And just being like, like, who's this guy?"
2025.32,2026.32," Like, what the fuck?"
2026.32,2029.32," You know, and like having say, well, I'm going to have to do something to show"
2029.32,2031.32, people that I justify being here.
2031.32,2034.32, And I really live for that and I'm super excited about that.
2034.32,2037.32," It's going to be cool to, I mean, I'm not just like, you know,"
2037.32,2038.32, blowing some muck up your ass.
2038.32,2041.32, I'm really excited to be learning all this new stuff.
2041.32,2045.32," And I mean, God, after all these years, I mean, there's so much I want to do."
2045.32,2047.32, And this is the hard thing too.
2047.32,2048.3199999999997, There's so much I just can't talk about.
2048.3199999999997,2050.3199999999997," I mean, it's so."
2050.3199999999997,2053.3199999999997, And now I know what it's like to be on the other side.
2053.3199999999997,2055.3199999999997, I already even know I'm not technically there.
2055.3199999999997,2057.3199999999997," You know, we're like, I wish I could tell you what it was."
2057.3199999999997,2058.3199999999997, I wish I could tell you what the project is.
2058.3199999999997,2061.3199999999997, It's other than it's just going to surprise everyone.
2061.32,2066.32," And I mean, I wouldn't have just made this switch for for anything."
2066.32,2070.32," I mean, this is something I'm entirely behind that the people there are."
2070.32,2072.32, I want you guys to talk.
2072.32,2074.32," Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
2074.32,2079.32," I just want to, you know, do you know, like, you were going to go work for, you know,"
2079.32,2080.32, the people who made by our shop?
2080.32,2083.32, I'm writing a preview for need for speed.
2083.32,2084.32, Thanks.
2084.32,2086.32, Think of me when you moved to Boston.
2086.32,2087.32, Okay.
2088.32,2093.32," Yeah, I would be doing like Barney Rebels bedrock racing for I remember."
2093.32,2095.32, I remember a boy color.
2095.32,2098.32," I remember when when when when when me and Sean first started hanging out,"
2098.32,2102.32," it was right after like I moved to the Bay Area and I was trying to get into this place,"
2102.32,2104.32, trying to get a gig here.
2104.32,2107.32, And right when I got here a bunch of people got fired.
2107.32,2112.32, And Sean was one of the people who got let like go because it was just like the bad time magazines were closing.
2112.32,2113.32, Instead of we're laid off.
2113.32,2114.32, We weren't laid off.
2114.32,2115.32," Okay, laid off."
2116.32,2117.32, Sorry.
2117.32,2119.32, This is a bunch of people to lay it off.
2119.32,2126.32," And, and I remember meeting up with Sean so that we could work on a fucking best buy catalog together."
2126.32,2127.32, Okay.
2127.32,2128.32, That was the low point.
2128.32,2129.32, Okay.
2129.32,2130.32, That was the fucking crazy little point.
2130.32,2131.32, That was huge.
2131.32,2132.32, We did hundreds of entries.
2132.32,2133.32, Yeah.
2133.32,2135.32," It was, it was not fun, but it was work."
2135.32,2136.32, It didn't look like a well.
2136.32,2139.32, And that was like three years ago or something.
2139.32,2143.32," And now and now you're, you're headed out to amazingly bigger and better things."
2143.32,2145.32, And I'm writing about need for speed.
2145.32,2148.32," Yeah, you'll be, I mean, come on, don't put it that way."
2148.32,2151.32," You do, you know, all of this other stuff you do."
2151.32,2152.32, Amazing features.
2152.32,2155.32, And I was going to make this about me.
2155.32,2157.32, He's not chuffed it out.
2157.32,2158.32, Yeah.
2158.32,2161.32," Let's just put this with like, I feel totally grateful."
2161.32,2168.32," And I mean, it definitely, I'm grateful to everyone that listened to the podcast because I mean, that played a part in it."
2168.32,2172.32," I mean, it was amazing to go for interviews and have many of the people in speaking to."
2172.32,2176.32," No, something about me because of the podcast, you know?"
2176.32,2177.32, Yeah.
2177.32,2195.32," And like, I mean, even just this week, the amount is just the things that people are doing, the videos and the audio stuff they do, the shirt that you're wearing, the candy, David Loosen, we're eating some corn crisp from Korea that tastes like Captain Peanut Butter Captain Crunch."
2195.32,2196.32, Yeah.
2196.32,2200.32," And all that's like, I mean, that's going to be obviously the hard thing to give up, right?"
2200.32,2201.32, Yeah.
2201.32,2211.32," I think we can all admit every week, there comes a day when the podcast comes out and you love going on the threads and stuff and seeing what people are saying and the stroking your ego or like picking fights with you whatever it is."
2211.32,2213.32," It's like, they people are just paying attention to you."
2213.32,2214.32, Yeah.
2214.32,2216.32," And it's like the, I mean, that's like a hard thing to give up."
2216.32,2220.32, That's the story that I usually only experience on Craigslist when those pictures of my day.
2220.32,2221.32," I mean,"
2222.32,2223.32, yeah.
2225.32,2228.32," And then again, we had to be completely prepared."
2228.32,2236.32," Sorry, the only one that's here that's actually giving it up, that was, is you and me Ryan and Robert Ashley are just kind of being forced out."
2236.32,2237.32, No.
2237.32,2239.32," Just kidding, I'm just kidding."
2239.32,2240.32, You guys are kidding.
2240.32,2242.32, Not welcome to carry on.
2242.32,2243.32, Gifter.
2243.32,2245.32," No, we're a few, I don't think we're going to carry on Gifter."
2245.32,2248.32," No, this is, this is the last, the end of everything."
2248.32,2254.2000000000003," Like losing Shomelo was one thing like that was a hard blow than losing Jeff, but losing off three you guys like"
2254.76,2258.0," Yeah, who the hell's gonna host it me?"
2258.0,2261.6000000000004," Yeah, I don't think anybody wants their only side men left. Oh"
2262.48,2266.92, You guys aren't sighting but we'll be we're talking about how you know what to do next
2266.92,2271.02," Maybe we'll carry on maybe we won't don't know yeah, we'll say everyone there"
2271.02,2273.02, Okay
2273.66,2277.62, I'm gonna but aren't you guys like super thankful to everyone that's like
2279.62,2284.46," I mean, do that I'm not in two pieces of art with myself on it as a result"
2285.46,2290.42, Imagine if you could tell yourself a year ago that that not one but two people and capable
2290.42,2297.78," Very capable of telling your illustrators are going to be drawing you and not only just drawing you, but as you see yourself in all of your fantasies"
2297.78,2299.78, That's Jedi fucking night
2300.5800000000004,2306.1800000000003," And calling you by your nickname, but not to make fun of you the other I know right the other one was a lot more Jedi night"
2306.34,2310.2200000000003, This one is like very much me when I'm at home for saying my bedroom
2311.94,2317.52," Yeah, you know this has definitely been the best thing for me like especially the last few years"
2317.52,2322.6800000000003, I mean everyone when they when they do this thing when they when they start writing and stuff
2322.6800000000003,2326.96, They want to find like an audience somebody who gives a shit about what they're doing and
2327.32,2329.32, It's hard to do that
2329.32,2338.4, When it comes to writing really hard and I was surprised by how awesome the broody of fans have been and I've really enjoyed like having a chance to
2338.96,2343.84, To talk about dumb shit and have people think that it was funny to listen to you
2343.84,2349.16," Yeah, and do paintings of it. Yeah, and do paintings. Yeah, look at that we've got paintings of y'all like"
2350.12,2354.8, lactating and someone took and made like you know
2354.8,2358.76, They they made green yogurt or milk or something and they put hair in it
2358.76,2363.5600000000004," Maybe they cut their own hair to put that in there. Yeah, this is for the infamous picture of the y'all don't y'all"
2363.5600000000004,2365.5600000000004, Alphonse milk
2365.5600000000004,2371.2400000000002," Yeah, I mean being on the podcast was like my like a dream come true to me when I first got the job"
2371.2400000000002,2373.2400000000002, I listen I listen
2373.2400000000002,2375.88, I have my old job at the laba is that dude
2375.88,2381.5600000000004, Jill picking up I was just like everyone else at least in right now or anything like picking up GFW radio at
2382.12,2383.64, Some point was like a
2383.64,2387.92, The best part of my week like I'd sit there and listen to it to get me through like the boring as drives
2387.92,2393.82," I did so then once I started working here, and I don't want to accept that the best part of your week for real honestly"
2393.82,2398.58, Like I had a fucking said why do you think I got out of that job dude
2400.12,2404.32," So it was like fucking miserable, but you know I know that feeling you know"
2404.32,2407.7599999999998, I mean I remember working you know when it all the time I worked in a grocery store
2408.0800000000004,2412.1600000000003, And so there's any like confusion as to the chronology. This is the same time that I was you know
2412.6400000000003,2417.32, Well I work in grocery for seven years so and then toward the later years of that it overlap with when I was teaching
2417.32,2421.6400000000003, But I would go to the magazine rack on a break and I'd read EGM and shit and I'd like look at the
2422.0800000000004,2424.48, The bios and stuff and like look at these fuckers man
2424.48,2426.0400000000004, They get to see him pose with like
2426.0400000000004,2431.0400000000004, Pokemon stuff to animals and shit like I got to go do a wet clean up on aisle three
2432.6400000000003,2437.0800000000004, And then it was amazing you know like when I went when I first went in and got the job
2437.08,2442.0," No, it's interviewing everyone's like to this is CJ and this is you know shoe and crisp and"
2443.08,2445.4, Greg Stewart Mark McDonald like everyone you know
2445.4,2452.04, I knew from reading the magazine stuff and it was like so I don't know I've never law. I mean I'm I'm always been grateful for
2452.68,2455.2, I don't know for what I'm doing I mean it's oh yeah
2455.44,2462.0, It's awesome and the podcast is definitely one of the best parts of that because for all the reasons we're talking and even you know even like say for example
2462.64,2467.28, You know a whole a whole a whole a lot more people read EGM than listen to this podcast and
2468.48,2472.72, Get at the same time the same thing for you could say same for CJW and JFW
2472.96,2477.84," We both had more subscribers and new stand-seals, you know combines to to dwarf the"
2478.32,2480.32, The downloads on this but it didn't
2480.72,2485.32, Because the feedback is there and it's like so regular and immediate. I mean it really
2486.0,2491.92, It's really easy to say like I can't I mean this is like let's just like make this as good as we possibly can
2492.0,2497.82," You know given the restrictions and stuff. Yeah, I mean I don't know I kind of feel awkward saying that because most time we would just come down and talk"
2497.82,2501.92," But I know what you mean. No, I've never had one person ever send me"
2502.3,2506.22, Feedback about anything I wrote knee jam or like maybe one time on the site
2506.44,2510.56," But yeah, and it was like and it was like your view of"
2510.96,2514.92, Dice the way you're seven was so unfair. That's basically exactly
2514.92,2518.48, See on this like I go on and I get like those those photos
2518.48,2524.8, I sent you of that yodel painting or I get like I don't know maybe someone even just telling me about their breakup story with some girl
2524.8,2531.3," Yeah, after I do a chafflov thing in treats my office is just full of treats from from people which is like"
2531.3,2533.7, And frankincense in my engulf
2534.2,2536.2," Yeah, it's good stuff like"
2536.76,2540.92," Every day, man. There's something something. Yeah, the brody is like a like a"
2542.84,2544.84, Like a career
2544.84,2548.44, Teddy bear that would hold you at night like it's okay
2548.48,2554.08," Everybody loves you and it was yeah, I think that's pretty I mean is funny for it's not just us"
2554.08,2555.6," I mean, I heard so many people like"
2556.4,2560.7400000000002, Specifically site the podcast that they do this being the highlight of their week
2561.26,2566.84, You know if they're work weekend and just like the thing that no matter I mean if anything is stressful or if anything
2566.84,2570.76, Isn't like you know quite going their way. It's like they always love doing the podcast
2571.28,2574.72," Yeah, and I mean we're I don't want to like you know going to it again"
2574.72,2579.1," Because I know we've talked about it before, but it was pretty amazing like I mean I talked about how when I started"
2579.1,2580.8399999999997, I was so reluctant and I really didn't see you
2580.8399999999997,2587.8799999999997, But I couldn't even imagine the worth and doing a podcast and you were the same. I mean I had to like strong arm you and to doing the fit yeah into taping
2589.7599999999998,2591.2799999999997," Yes, but"
2591.2799999999997,2594.16, But it's a good idea and we for it we first started doing it we were like
2595.08,2597.08, That was this we hate this
2597.72,2601.7999999999997, This is stupid why are we being forced to do this and honestly Ryan never changed his mind
2602.32,2605.26, He's been sitting here like he's neck food and
2605.76,2608.1000000000004, All the thing about Mega Man every single
2608.7200000000003,2609.7200000000003, As compared
2609.7200000000003,2615.78, Little as I say on here I do like the podcast let's break it. Let's get the Ryan perspective
2617.0800000000004,2619.0800000000004, Respectives with Ryan
2619.0800000000004,2621.32, Oh geez. I just had the worst mental image
2621.8,2623.8, What I don't know if you guys want to hear about
2623.8,2628.0800000000004, Now you have to say it right off the hook give us the mental image and then put him back
2628.08,2633.74, So you know like how like as soon as the yodel shit came out people were posting pictures the yodel flesh light in the bed with the picture yodel
2633.74,2638.38, You know I just pictureing like people need to give us some images of
2639.0,2641.7999999999997, Mega Man with the flesh light wielding arm
2645.36,2648.04, So it's already that's already up on DV and or somewhere
2649.3199999999997,2651.92," Search it and it wasn't a joke. Yeah, yeah"
2652.56,2654.56, No back up back on the spot
2654.56,2658.44," Well, I mean I'm I'm a little bit different from you guys because I don't really"
2658.7599999999998,2664.12, Jump on the message boards that much. So I don't really get a lot of alert not
2665.2,2671.6, Not really I mean I kind of I used to a lot more back when we had separate boards like we had like the PC
2672.7599999999998,2675.2799999999997, Ford and all the video game board and stuff or separate
2675.7599999999998,2681.2, But you know since they merged them I've kind of I haven't really gone on to him very much
2681.2,2686.06, So I don't I don't pay much attention to a lot of that feedback same with like gaming age forums
2686.06,2688.06, I don't really look at that very often
2688.06,2693.3399999999997," But um, you know every now and then somebody else in mini mail or private message and you know"
2693.3399999999997,2695.96, That's kind of cool. You know always talk of those people so
2696.8799999999997,2701.62," Yeah, the feedback that I pay attention to I've always appreciated and you know it's pretty cool"
2703.64,2708.52," Yes, so we just basically we want to invite all the birthday listeners back to our place for the after party"
2709.08,2713.38, So we talked about you know we posted on the message board you got the address
2714.12,2716.12, Rock band two stages of
2717.0,2723.68, Bands and and you know hot hot women dancing and we got a DJ and lots of food and
2724.12,2726.12, Cags
2726.68,2728.68," Mega man, you know"
2728.68,2736.14, What else man? There's a bring a me I'm trying to think of everything that I saw at the enormous Sony E3 party that I went to three years
2736.8799999999997,2738.8799999999997, There are leech door wrestlers
2740.4,2742.4, The food fighters are playing
2743.1,2746.8599999999997," Food fighters. Yeah, there's you know prime rib sushi"
2748.02,2752.06, All you know all that stuff so come on back. We will be glad to meet and greet
2752.7799999999997,2757.08, You know I just thought maybe someone will ask but I've had so many people
2757.62,2763.7799999999997, Ask about how to get in the industry for the recommendation about or about how to to write about games for living
2763.78,2768.32, I figured like I know we can all answer this while we're waiting for calls like it's Santa
2770.82,2774.88, We could we could do that but I mean like I'll start off. I mean a lot of people asked me to say packs
2774.88,2777.4, I didn't have time to answer everyone in detail
2779.44,2783.1000000000004, But I would say first office that you should want to well it depends now
2783.1000000000004,2787.2000000000003, It's different I mean what there's podcasts no stuff about it say you should if you want to Korean writing
2787.2000000000003,2792.28, You should be a writer first and foremost in a gamer second or at least in an equal measure
2792.5600000000004,2795.96, You shouldn't say I'm a gamer then this is the job for me
2795.96,2801.48, I mean you have I mean I insist that I mean they're they're far too many just gamers in a business and not enough
2801.7200000000003,2804.2000000000003, You know writers and so I think that's key
2804.2000000000003,2807.7200000000003, But then I also like don't get discouraged me not everyone has a different story
2807.7200000000003,2810.52, But how they got in the business and a lot of them have to do
2811.1600000000003,2813.4, With friends and connections and whatnot
2813.4,2819.28, But I honestly think that with the right people your your writing samples will we'll say everything that needs to be said
2819.28,2821.28, I mean
2821.44,2827.0400000000004," She was cool enough to bring me on board just based on writing samples and of course, you know some talks on the phone afterward"
2827.0400000000004,2830.84," And I mean this is the same for you too, right Robert?"
2830.84,2833.7000000000003," I mean you send in samples. Yeah, you know like after college"
2833.7000000000003,2840.0, I'd been like writing about games from my college newspaper at a university taxes and I sent stuff to I basically
2840.0,2849.48, Spammed everyone with a ziff Davis email account back in like 2000 and the one person that I heard back from was was a guy named Chris Baker
2849.64,2853.0, Who the he's called C-bay here. He worked at
2853.64,2855.64, Official PlayStation magazine
2855.64,2857.64, Now nowadays he works for Marvel
2858.68,2865.16, As a PR guy but back then he wrote me back because he was a Texan and he was like oh fellow Texan
2865.16,2867.32," I feel bad for you. You know, yeah"
2867.64,2873.08," Like I'll read your samples and he read my samples like yeah, this is pretty good. You know if you want to pitch something and so I"
2873.64,2875.64, I pitched stories
2875.64,2880.04, That's another thing for people to I mean like the traditional thing you say samples it would be
2880.68,2885.56, To pay very close attention to whoever it is you want to write force say for example. It's EGM
2885.96,2890.2799999999997, Look and see how they do things the every you know magazine websites can have a voice sometimes
2890.2799999999997,2893.72," There's quite a range of voices, you know like I think it won up just quite quite a"
2894.44,2899.16," quite a bit of different you know approaches and whatnot, but but have some sense for you know who you're"
2900.04,2905.8799999999997, I mean this is just the basics right I mean if you notice that in magazine previews are never more than two pages
2905.8799999999997,2909.8799999999997, Do a word count and see what they do and write something that you think could be placed in there
2909.8799999999997,2916.3599999999997, But even better though like like Robert especially I mean features and proper story pitches are the most
2916.3599999999997,2921.16, Impressive when you can show that I can you can see an idea through from start to finish
2921.16,2926.68, I mean you can see of something and then you can deliver on it and I mean that'll immediately that's how I like
2927.16,2932.8399999999997, Matt Peckam wrote a lot for CGW and GFW and again do nothing about him just got a
2933.64,2939.16, Blind submission and and it was a featurey route and read it and like this is wonderful got back to her immediately
2939.7999999999997,2943.24, And ask for something else that he had already done so he didn't have to do extra work
2943.24,2948.8399999999997," And it's like if this is good get you started right away, you know so it can be that easy, but that's also very difficult because"
2949.3999999999996,2952.2799999999997, What that doesn't say is like just how picky somebody it is. They're gonna be
2952.9199999999996,2956.6," Yeah, I think I think the other thing is you got to hope that you've got Sean Elliott on the other side"
2956.68,2958.68, That email
2958.68,2963.3999999999996, It's the same forever. You know maybe not right because I mean I didn't feel bad a lot of times people
2963.8799999999997,2969.72," Like say for example, you know so someone will give me I got a few people that actually had samples for me at packs and it's like"
2970.9199999999996,2977.48," It felt really awkward, you know because when I looked him it's like they're just not ready at least for for what I would have in mind and then what happens there is that like"
2978.3599999999997,2983.8799999999997, I mean everyone every editor's got different pet peeves and stuff too. What I mean minor. They should be fairly obviously from the party guests
2984.84,2991.48," Not just cliches and far as like the structure and actual wording, but just the thinking I mean when you're seeing"
2993.08,2999.0, Just when you read if you like say for example you read a sample preview and and when you're done you're like why did I read this?
2999.0,3002.92," There's not early in the point something that was like horrible or anything, but just like there was no"
3003.2400000000002,3009.32," You need thinking there's no you know perspective or anything. Oh, we got our first call man. Yeah, no"
3014.84,3020.6800000000003, This is exciting. We got a call. All right say something. Oh my god is it working oh
3021.96,3025.88," This is made contact working yeah, you hear us?"
3028.44,3030.44, Say are you wet?
3030.44,3032.44, Is it wet not are you wet?
3033.88,3037.08," Okay, so he can hear us real quick. This is who is this?"
3038.28,3041.2400000000002, I know man. I was trying to set you up to play with that
3043.88,3049.0, I mean come on. I'm not good. I'm not gonna come on and do a voice and come on. I want to call in because I think it's
3049.88,3051.88, Great for you and sad for everyone that you're leaving
3052.6,3054.6," Thanks, Lou"
3054.6,3058.04, I didn't want you to do a voice out there right now. I'd give you like a sweaty hug
3059.96,3061.8, I'm just taking a break from
3062.6,3064.84, Just from playing Xbox live and eating pizza all day
3066.52,3069.56, I take a break stop stop stop on my face and give a call
3070.2,3073.64," Good shit. Good shit. So hey, I saw you a packs like what uh"
3074.6,3077.24, You got an interesting anecdote from from when you were a packs
3077.64,3079.64, Do you just actually do
3080.2,3083.96, So I'm walking out of the venue and you guys probably get this you guys probably get this all the time
3084.44,3087.96, I'm walking out of the venue and the kids stops and I let out a huge like
3088.7599999999998,3092.44, MASSIVE sneeze like one of those sneezes that like a two-year-old has were like
3092.84,3097.88, Snackos everywhere and I'm like I blow mine the eyes I sneeze like into my hand into my right hand
3098.36,3101.96, And now this kids walking by and he's like you're you're Luke Smith
3102.52,3107.8," Like ah yeah, do I am I'm Luke Smith going to get a clean up? He like I would just really like to shake her"
3109.32,3113.4," Listen bro, I like you know I wipe it down a gene like you know like listen"
3113.4,3115.0, I just need to my hand
3115.4,3117.7200000000003, Like I don't care I just want to shake her
3119.0,3123.0, So I did and I'm like the most disgusting thing I've ever seen in my whole life
3123.72,3125.72, It's like the goat's the advantage
3127.32,3128.04, Wow
3128.04,3132.84, That's there I did closest I came was like I just got done taking a piss and I'd wash my hand
3132.84,3135.64, But like all the paper towels were gone there
3135.64,3139.72, I mean that knows what was happening to them but like and then I immediately came out and so I wanted to shake my hand
3139.72,3144.76, I was like it's clean it's just watered up this and it wasn't that bad
3144.76,3148.68, I guess you're giving like a courtesy shake though you like shake your hands off a little before you did it
3148.68,3152.68," Yeah, and I felt awkward because other I mean better that than like I"
3153.08,3157.96, Don't know man could you for some reason I think you could probably pull it off where you didn't have to wipe your hand
3157.96,3162.6, You could have just acted like this is just how it is man when you shake my hand. This is what happens
3166.36,3169.8, It was like it was just now I mean
3169.8,3174.04, I don't ever wash my hands and I pee anyway. I mean I just want to let him touch it
3174.36,3178.84, Dude that's actually upsetting to me because I I saw I
3178.92,3181.88, Watch thoroughly. I carry pure rail in my butt my back
3181.88,3185.56, You're saying that because in case it gets back to any your coworkers man
3186.6000000000004,3193.08, You know she was neurotic here about that when he worked here that there was a put up like posters and stuff in the bathroom
3194.28,3197.56, I forgot to wash their hands. I was in here when they did it that's disgusting
3199.08,3204.36, You know what was he would come back and aim me to and he would tell me who he tell me who it was
3204.92,3209.2400000000002, And it would be like what am I supposed to like what am I supposed to go tell my kid
3217.2400000000002,3221.4, There um do you got any advice for Anthony aka chuff?
3221.96,3229.2400000000002, He's basically he needs your romantic advice he's he's single and he's on the market and he needs to know how to be a player
3230.36,3232.84," My god, it's like the blindly in the blind"
3234.36,3236.36, Afro
3236.36,3240.1200000000003," Yeah, man we're talking about yeah, yeah, okay step one"
3240.92,3242.92, Hair cut
3244.92,3246.92, You're too clothing upgrade
3247.7200000000003,3255.1600000000003," Oh dude, what is this coming from you gonna send them up? You want to get like what you mean this creep you know? It's like where I are you gonna send them"
3255.56,3257.56, Send them a box of halo shirts
3257.56,3259.56, Yeah
3259.56,3261.56, You're interested in the master chief
3262.04,3263.72, I want to share a fight and send you
3264.6,3266.6, Chick's really dig it
3266.7599999999998,3271.7999999999997," Dude, Ed Anthony how do you what what do you make of that? I don't know. I think you're dressed for success right now"
3271.7999999999997,3276.7599999999998, I think I think it's all about who your receptive audience is like it depends on where you're
3276.7599999999998,3279.7999999999997, But you're like kind of track like what exactly
3282.68,3287.72," I'm just saying like no, I'm really interested in understanding with thank you with the hair with all on oh"
3287.7999999999997,3291.7999999999997, I just want to point I just want to point out that the last girl that I went on a date with
3292.52,3297.48, When I even said who it was without even saying your name Robert actually you fucking stopped me and high five me
3297.48,3299.48, That's true
3299.48,3304.7599999999998, But but granted I'm a married man and I'm pretty much excited about any talk of opposite sex
3306.9199999999996,3312.04, That's how I was funny we ended up like being like on the sidelines like I'm always given Anthony advice
3312.6,3316.2," And you're like shit. I've become that dude. Yeah, like the old guys that used to work"
3316.2,3322.8399999999997, I want to go back to Anthony's date actually okay. I'm gonna go back to that so that was the first day how to second one
3325.08,3328.52, Well you're talking about like there hasn't been any other girls since that girl
3328.8399999999997,3331.64," So you still with the same one? No, I'm not with her though"
3331.64,3337.0, It didn't that that's why you says career advice man. Well she she said she liked my hair Luke
3338.12,3342.6," And then and but not enough to go out with you again. Oh, it wasn't his hair"
3342.68,3349.56, I think I think it was like it was in the way that it got planted and you comfortable with me
3350.7599999999998,3359.3199999999997," Yeah, I think it started off so gentlemanly like because it was like the first thing you had her over to play"
3359.56,3361.56, Signally hit with you and like for me
3361.7999999999997,3366.7599999999998, That's a worst case scenario because it's one of those things where if she doesn't know it like dude
3366.7599999999998,3372.12, This guy just wants to be friends or like I mean it's like what's up? She doesn't know it's like the difference between if you made it clear
3372.2799999999997,3377.24," That it's gonna be a date date then if she says yes, you can go with confidence that like there's no miscommunication"
3377.24,3381.64, You know what like at least what the premise of the setup is but then like I don't know man
3381.64,3386.4, Maybe it's not all that but if you started off on the wrong foot you don't want to start it off with like the check-in cheese
3386.4,3387.72, Ballroom and sign it
3387.72,3394.56, So dear so that wasn't like it crazy as any story or just tell me dude my man actually had a lady friend come over to his house
3394.56,3396.56, It was like let's play silent hell
3402.12,3405.08, The picture up at a game stop so
3406.6,3411.5, Hold on hold on this that was this was something she wanted to do I was just abyshing her
3411.5,3416.64, I was she suggested it now she wanted to like well she did want to play sign held together
3416.64,3418.3599999999997," And I was like all right, so why don't we do that sometime?"
3418.3599999999997,3420.52, But that take this lesson now seriously
3420.52,3426.92, I'm not not not fucking with you should take this lesson and remember this as a this is what she wants to do when you're wise
3426.92,3430.48, And they tell you that she wants that kids just remember the silent hell day
3432.92,3436.2, I just want you to take just that you're that's a pro tip and that one three
3436.2,3439.88, Thank you. I actually really I appreciate that that won't even be in my book
3441.0,3446.08, But do you have any any pro tips for me going over I mean like you obviously
3446.08,3448.08," Yeah, I mean the press to the thing is just"
3449.7599999999998,3454.56, You're gonna I mean dude you're gonna be awesome. You're gonna do awesome out there just taken as much as you can like it
3454.56,3457.3199999999997, It's I always think it's I think it's really interesting when people
3457.6800000000003,3462.3, Switch over into development houses because they see things from the other side and you've always been really
3462.3,3464.3, perceptive and I remember
3464.5,3467.5, Specifically while I was working at one up one the first time you pointed out the
3467.94,3470.1600000000003, The crate at the end of gears of war that
3470.6000000000004,3472.6000000000004, preceded the train event
3472.6000000000004,3477.3, Like the first time you pointed it out I was like man. I didn't even I didn't even I even see that
3477.3,3479.6800000000003, It's like I don't even like that was totally pulled over my
3480.32,3485.1600000000003, I just just your ability to to make those observations is gonna be something that's totally valuable
3485.16,3488.64," Have you said you have you if you already said where you're going? Yeah, I have okay"
3488.64,3491.48," You know no, I mean that's gonna be totally available to those guys there"
3491.48,3495.7599999999998, And it's great that they recognize that and have a place free there. I think it's gonna be awesome
3495.7599999999998,3497.7599999999998, Just do you just fund it up?
3497.7599999999998,3499.7599999999998, But can you can you wash all over you like
3500.7599999999998,3510.3999999999996," You know, can you give him some tips on how he can deal with the amount of snack food available to someone at a video game developer?"
3510.3999999999996,3514.52, I mean dude I've been prepping for it with our faith. I've been sending it
3514.6,3516.88," It's true, but man. I mean, it's a dangerous"
3516.88,3524.56, I mean you go in like a video game developer and it's just like basically half computers and half a giant stock pile of Doritos and various
3525.2,3529.52," Energy drinks yeah, and I don't know if Sean's prepared to"
3530.24,3533.88, Handle that kind of high-freak test corn syrup diet
3534.88,3539.2, I would assume that I would assume that they'll have a pretty healthy selection of fruit
3539.2,3542.0, I recommend smoked almonds actually
3542.0,3544.0, Oh man
3544.0,3546.0, It's a good kick start to the day
3547.0,3549.92, I started each morning with I don't like it to work
3550.36,3556.8, Did you have morning with smoked almonds and the delicious latte from the local Starbucks?
3556.8,3560.2, That's Seattle style though. I don't know what the deal was embossed and what's up? What's up?
3560.2,3561.2, What's up? What's up?
3561.2,3562.0, How old are you?
3562.0,3568.24, You start you start with a shot of whiskey and you make your and you make your way to the airsmits show
3568.24,3570.24, Yeah
3570.24,3572.24, It's not like ocean shores or whatever
3572.24,3575.52, Did you wake up you you get your com Brady poster
3576.24,3578.24, You uh
3578.24,3582.24, Wanking in the cowardice is a red still there. I mean I don't know if I'm boss and that
3582.24,3584.24, Break forward in the room
3586.24,3595.12, I have a friend from Boston who's always telling me about the local no manclature and he was saying that he had gone home to visit some friends and go to his brothers wedding and
3595.12,3600.64, One of his friends was hanging out with him in the parking lot after the wedding and saw some super hot girl walk by him and said
3600.64,3603.3599999999997, Look at that babes. He's got such a sweet dumpa
3604.48,3611.8399999999997, What dumpa a dumper a dumper an ass a dumper a dumper a dumper a dumper
3611.8399999999997,3613.8399999999997, The food that comes out of me
3613.8399999999997,3619.44," Yes, and it wasn't it was like he was really attracted to her, but he said dumper"
3625.68,3631.6," Oh, I don't know so Luke after after after you after like God I'm already kidding"
3633.44,3637.3599999999997, So after you switched over and and you know left one of yours and one up
3637.92,3642.24, Did you have any any periods where you second guessed yourself or did you get over you know
3642.24,3648.7999999999997, Having the podcast feedback on a weekly basis fairly quickly or do you still go on gaff and look for and search for instances of your name?
3648.7999999999997,3653.68, I don't accept well I've let's tell the uh the searching for my name today. Shane
3655.12,3657.12, What a mess that's been consumed with me
3658.08,3662.96, Actually freakish the he's like registered on bungee nands. Sounds me matches all the time. Are you serious?
3664.48,3667.2, Never know you know this game or tag anything
3667.92,3669.92, I just got these names
3669.92,3671.92, It's so close and I'll do it just now
3672.16,3675.92," Let's just let's do it right here. No, I can't do that. Tell man. I'm not sure"
3675.92,3679.44, The freaky thing is it that's in the count a lot of people are familiar with
3679.52,3683.52, I'm not even going back
3683.52,3688.2400000000002," Well, I'll say this it's it's right on your noses one of these days"
3689.04,3694.08, Shane will fess up and he'll say who he is and everyone's gonna be like oh my god
3694.08,3697.12," It was so obvious yeah, we never thought of it"
3698.56,3702.64," To go back to your real question. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, they're been a bunch of incidents where"
3703.2000000000003,3705.04, Like that were things have happened in gaming
3705.04,3710.0, I thought that make me it's never regret it's just like oh man like I said to someone here
3710.24,3715.92, But the ensemble closing last week. I'm like man. There's a story to tell and I just hope that someone
3716.48,3720.8, You know someone covering the industry finds a way to tell it and it's it's something that where there's like a
3721.12,3726.24," A big event or an interesting sales period or you know, there's a game where I feel like"
3726.64,3730.32, You know the reviewers got it right or got it wrong. I wish that I could have you know
3730.6400000000003,3733.84, Share it. I thought about it like you know in a frank way
3734.4,3740.48," Outside of the confines of my my work with bungee right, but stuff like that"
3740.8,3747.1200000000003, Absolutely the studio closer shit is tough. I totally know you know where you're coming at on that and I mean
3747.6800000000003,3751.92, We always felt guilty whenever something like that happens and we don't have anything to say and like you know
3751.92,3760.1600000000003, When Vanguard went down Ryan had just a huge amount of reporting done and ultimately wasn't able to use it because it was so
3760.96,3765.6000000000004, I mean he was basically sitting on a number of bombs and ultimately just didn't have permission
3765.6000000000004,3771.36, I mean he had people that were talking to him and then realizing like oh I should have said that and coming back and saying you can't use that
3771.92,3776.88, All sorts of stuff of kidding getting into what sucks. I mean sometimes it's not sometimes the absence of the stories on these things
3776.88,3780.4, Doesn't necessarily mean that no one thought of it or didn't try but some shit came up
3780.4,3783.52," But yeah, I mean there I think that I mean that'll be the frustrating thing"
3783.52,3785.44, I mean you ever sort of like you know
3785.44,3788.48, PM people that that's still right and say like hey man
3788.96,3795.12," You ever think about doing this story and then they're like just shut up, man. You know I wish that I wish that I would do that"
3795.12,3800.4, But now it's not really that's not really my place. I mean there's a bunch of folks doing really good work and
3801.2,3805.2, But it's a temptation I like to be like I'm and
3805.44,3810.56," Only someone would get on that, but it just yeah, I can't do that. I want to be pretty separated from that"
3810.56,3814.72, I want to know what everyone here and like you included think of just like the rise of
3815.2,3818.3999999999996," Both the game or honestly, but also like tabloid ol aspect of of"
3818.8799999999997,3824.9599999999996, Game coverage and specifically what I have in mind is like this week a number of things came up. You know one was the allegation that Google was buying valve
3826.3999999999996,3830.56, And then there was something else and it proved to be you know totally a spurious
3830.56,3831.7599999999998, But what
3831.7599999999998,3837.8399999999997, What's frustrating is that you know people know that can get clicks by just rumor-mongering just generating making something up and then another side
3837.8399999999997,3840.8799999999997, It's like oh we can get even more clicks by disproving this is is
3841.6,3844.56, You know being fake or whatever and it's like you just
3845.2799999999997,3851.12, I don't know I'm worried of the point when you have just this whole aspect of the industry that's basically making shit up and then
3851.68,3856.96, Someone else you know like the symbiotic relationship like okay you make some bullshit up today and then we'll we'll
3856.96,3859.6," Disprove it and then alright tomorrow's your turn to make some shit up, you know"
3859.92,3864.24, It's like the self-sustaining rumor meal. I don't know man to the power of banner ads
3864.7999999999997,3868.32, I was just thinking about that because remember that picture we just took in 711
3868.64,3871.84, Cuz in 711 we saw that poster that was like pre order your games
3872.32,3877.04, And it hit and the top one was fall out 3 at 711 and it said 360 59
3877.52,3882.96, PS3 59 PS2 49 and and Sean was like oh shit we could run that it's story
3884.32,3886.32, The hidden skew of
3886.96,3892.4, You passed it that ad money. I told him as a joke. I'm like you took the I'll take that picture
3892.4,3894.8, I take so place was seriously run that as a new story
3895.6000000000004,3898.7200000000003, I did take it nice show that's how I knew that I did during he just laughed was good
3899.28,3901.28, so good
3901.28,3904.96, I think that I mean the term I used to use for was scoreboard pouring because
3905.92,3911.1200000000003, Whatever I can remember that's a game tab is like the collection of headlines of that zip david side
3911.1200000000003,3913.1200000000003, Or I don't know that's it now
3913.36,3920.5600000000004, But I like a collection of headlines and it bumps like the stuff that gets the most traffic to the top and some of those those headlines like like that like
3921.1200000000003,3926.88," 4,299 or 4999 PS3 where it's not fall out confirm like that'd be like a number one hit on game tab"
3926.88,3929.92," Insomely right like yeah, I think that the problem is just"
3930.7200000000003,3932.7200000000003, It's some of the stuff that
3932.7200000000003,3935.52, I mean it's just it's a really difficult model to sustain
3935.52,3939.2000000000003, I mean it's some of these sites pay per post some of these sites
3939.92,3943.52, Ad generated some of these sites bonus based on traffic volumes
3943.52,3944.7200000000003, I mean
3944.7200000000003,3950.88, Just that the model fueling it is a can be a really dangerous one and I think what it comes down to it
3950.88,3956.56, It's like there's only so much real news like official news you can have and and that stuff kind of comes out
3956.96,3959.6, You know of the real the actual you know
3959.68,3965.52," Yeah, I'm see that's just kind of boring. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean you know like it's a lot of the past release"
3965.52,3970.7999999999997, So write it up like that's not fun man. I remember like that never wanted to change the press release
3970.7999999999997,3973.2799999999997, That's always want to try and find something more interesting
3973.44,3979.2, Trying to find like a real story and that's the thing about it is that's that that's hard work like chasing a real story
3979.2,3980.7999999999997, I remember some of the stuff that
3980.7999999999997,3982.7999999999997, Sean worked on while I was there and I was like
3983.52,3986.24, It's gonna be we're not gonna be a bad idea
3986.7999999999997,3988.7999999999997, But then it like yeah
3989.28,3993.6000000000004," I mean, I think it was specifically like the PR story that Robert worked on you know"
3994.0800000000004,3999.36, The press PR the people story then and I've got the future mean that was difficult. I mean that's like that's a whole thing
3999.36,4003.44, I'm wondering about I mean you do we've known all along you know we did certain type of feature in magazine
4003.44,4008.4, And we think that they do well there when you want a certain amount of value for you for your money
4008.4,4011.84, You want to magazines gonna last and then like I really appreciate features that are
4013.04,4017.92, Really well researched and and a answer as many questions as they raise and I think you know now in line
4018.0,4022.2400000000002, I mean we know you don't want to sit there and read and listen amounts of text online. I mean
4022.56,4028.64, Do people want I mean is it is it sometimes it seems as though it's serving some people better to simply raise a question than have the debate
4030.0,4032.0, Go on in the on you know on the internet
4033.36,4035.12," Sorry, I'm looking at Anthony playing with duct"
4035.92,4042.8, You were talking about this before like the idea that like nowadays the thing to do is to instead of writing a real like full feature
4042.96,4047.84, It's just to ask the question yeah get a couple of sound bites leave it open for all
4048.2400000000002,4055.44," People in the comments section find out and let yeah, let people hash it out online. Yeah, that's another one of those things that"
4055.84,4062.2400000000002," Is making my life feel really depressing right now. Thanks, but you know, Luke you say it's like difficult to you know"
4062.2400000000002,4066.4, I mean to find a real story and stuff and I totally agree but but the whale's so it's fairly easy to
4066.7200000000003,4072.64, Just fabricate something and go for that one I'm wondering about is if there's any like incentive against that
4072.64,4077.44, I mean is is there like the risk of fallout after a while where you just became
4077.92,4083.2000000000003, You have you know your your name is this reputable and people just stop paying attention to you. Or is that he had risk?
4085.2000000000003,4088.2400000000002, Was that big Sony reveal from
4088.64,4090.64, E3 2000 whatever
4090.64,4091.6800000000003, What what was that?
4091.6800000000003,4097.04, Is it gonna be the game that's gonna make you buy a PS3 I have one now was that was that folklore?
4097.04,4099.04, You're four oh
4099.2,4104.32, What that wasn't that the that was from the game he was talking about you can't talk about metal gear for can you
4105.28,4109.36, Probably not in the the degree that that we'd really like
4110.5599999999995,4114.719999999999," Okay, no, I mean I I finish and I enjoy the great deal of it so"
4115.44,4122.48," Yeah, I make a habit of not really talking about other hands. You can use their their one thing you could say about it that you've been dying to say though"
4124.0,4127.44, Other than that you that you really enjoyed it. I you know what you know
4128.08,4136.32, As much as people piss and moan about it dude the the spoiler alert if you have a mission yet massive huge spoiler alert
4136.879999999999,4138.879999999999, So Anthony maybe should like go into another room
4140.96,4146.719999999999, The the very end of the game. You we put that out of this actually bringing the character of the boss was really cool a big boss
4147.44,4152.719999999999," I like that at the with the very end of the game you you like that. I like no, okay"
4152.88,4156.56, She's right like I like the idea of bringing the boss out
4157.92,4163.6, Even though like that whole cock tease where there's like a bag of jibs and it turns out that that wasn't
4164.240000000001,4170.56," The big boss yeah, nope. I yelp. I I still like that. I just some of the stuff leading up to it"
4170.8,4176.240000000001, To the to the to the big boss coming out at the end. I felt like maybe took a little longer just because I
4176.4800000000005,4181.76, I cared so much more about some of like snake and I did about you know every other character in the game
4182.320000000001,4187.12," Yeah, I that was the point in the game at which it was like three o'clock in the morning for me"
4187.12,4191.6, And I had been under the impression that the game was going to be over for about five hours
4192.8,4196.72, And I remember like laying on the couch watching this really long
4197.2,4203.04, Conversation in the cemetery and like feeding in and out of conscious this and like waking up and wondering like that
4203.04,4205.76, I just hear him say that like what are you say?
4205.76,4209.360000000001," Yeah, one of the things one of the guys I work with here again him Doyle"
4210.32,4215.679999999999, He and I both finished it in similar time frames and like for probably two weeks afterwards
4215.679999999999,4222.16, We would we'd like jump on on I am and be like doing that whole bit between those two at the end and like I mean like zero or
4222.16,4223.92, Whoever that old guy actually poop
4224.24,4227.679999999999, He poops his pants all is there which is just strikes me swear
4228.48,4230.48, Like just always weird little like
4230.799999999999,4237.12, Sort of goofy things in line of this like more like a father or I saw whatever it was like I mean just like
4237.68,4239.12, I
4239.12,4241.12, Really like parts of that yeah
4241.12,4243.12, Rubber parts of it. I also I can relate to
4243.599999999999,4248.96, Professor voice that was being like and I'm on the couch. It's for in the morning. I've got to work in like three hours and
4249.599999999999,4250.5599999999995, Oh my god
4250.5599999999995,4252.5599999999995, I'm still listening to these two dude stalk
4252.8,4256.5599999999995, Rubber had some interesting shit where like was it Sarah or was it your friend?
4257.36,4263.44," Wasn't it Sam saw you watching the end of that game? I mean it was saw you. Well, yeah, he saw you watching the end of the game"
4263.76,4267.04," Well, he was he was watching me play the game and who was"
4267.12,4273.2, Getting really frustrated with like break break that down for for our listeners out there. I thought that was a mystery story
4273.76,4277.599999999999, I mean I don't know if I remember the exact like
4278.72,4284.4, Thing that happened all I all I remember and we told we talked about this once was just him sitting there
4284.4,4291.44, I'm watching me play and like and and getting really frustrated that I kept on being interrupted by the cutscenes
4291.44,4295.44," I mean it's not an uncommon thing. Oh, okay. Well, I thought it was no, I thought it was something else like it"
4295.759999999999,4300.48, For some reason the same room where you break it down such a way that was like it was really revealing how
4301.5199999999995,4306.719999999999, Someone who didn't know all about the series and about you know why this is one of the most anticipated games of the year
4306.96,4310.16, What react to just seeing the game in action? Oh
4310.16,4317.04, I think he's definitely weirded out by the by the content of those cutscenes like that it was totally gibberish
4317.599999999999,4323.679999999999, You know because he is not aware what anything about you know metal gear any of the characters and and you know
4323.68,4329.4400000000005, He's watching me like shoots some girl who's walking towards me saying I must cry
4332.4800000000005,4335.12," Weird things, but yeah, I don't know"
4335.68,4341.200000000001, I also actually just thinking about that I really liked this this screen split that they did in the last mission
4341.360000000001,4348.64," Yeah, that stuff was definitely that was pretty cool actually and like I thought parts of that like the way they brought the score up at that part"
4348.72,4352.320000000001, There was some parts of that would to you know for lack of a better term
4352.32,4356.639999999999, It's actually really cinematic and really well done where like you actually felt like you know
4356.639999999999,4360.639999999999," Oh shit, I've got to keep matching this button. I wish I didn't have the mash it for so long"
4361.2,4366.719999999999, But at the same time it was still like a cool sequence right and even before that too when you're fighting all the metal gears
4367.44,4370.4, And the sword the two dudes having like the really
4371.28,4373.28, gay subtext or it's fine above you
4374.0,4376.719999999999," Yeah, I like that there was something for everyone"
4376.72,4380.320000000001," Yeah, absolutely man who does to told you pro"
4381.52,4384.64, So what else what else we got to say before we yeah
4384.88,4391.84," I don't know what time is it live in TTEen? Yeah, race calling. What do you will yeah in on that we got five minutes okay"
4393.6,4395.6, I'm playing
4395.6,4397.6, Don't say halo
4397.6,4399.6, NHL09
4399.6,4401.6, Cool
4401.6,4403.6, Castle crashes is rad
4404.08,4408.4800000000005," Enjoying it yeah, although I only played it with people like locally"
4408.4800000000005,4410.4800000000005, I know everyone had problems playing it on my way
4410.4800000000005,4413.76, I haven't played it on my way because I'm afraid I'm gonna lose on the stuff
4414.08,4417.76," Yeah, but I had like you know three people ever to play and it was like old school"
4418.400000000001,4423.4400000000005," Fucking fun, you know arcade beat them up. We spent like an entire afternoon just playing that game"
4423.76,4427.68, This is a weird weird game for me that I hear everyone suddenly was talking about it
4427.92,4432.72, Is though everyone should know what it was about and I never remember reading a preview of it
4432.72,4436.88, I don't know where this like awareness came from because I still don't know like three years ago
4437.92,4444.72," You know as by do you remember that game alien hominid? Yeah, well it's like by the same folks and and it had been sort of"
4444.96,4447.200000000001, sharing the press and several different
4448.0,4452.320000000001, several different moments and just lately it hadn't really gotten as much
4453.280000000001,4455.280000000001, You know publicity
4455.759999999999,4460.719999999999," Right before it came out, but I think the people who were gonna be into it probably already knew about it"
4460.719999999999,4463.759999999999," Yeah, but the people that are into it seem to be like"
4464.5599999999995,4470.24, Very very into it. I mean they've got avatars of it. I mean I see that I had to ask one what that was I kept seeing that weird
4471.28,4474.639999999999, Little guy with a yeah cruise a form face or whatever it is
4475.599999999999,4480.4, So what kind of game is it? It's like a RPG being like final fight kind of except you level
4480.88,4484.8," Yeah, I mean you use like river city ransom exactly like river city ransom"
4485.36,4489.599999999999, And it's you know it's got a little bit more depth maybe when it comes to the
4490.16,4497.5199999999995," The fighting elements not tons and tons more, but they're plenty of moves and and you basically it's all hand drawn art like that guy"
4498.16,4502.96, Dan Palin Dan Palin can't remember why don't want to say paladin isn't that like a type of
4503.5199999999995,4511.84," Okay, but uh, but you know everything everything in the game is you know hand drawn by this guy and it all has that sort of like really vibrant"
4511.92,4521.360000000001, Cartoony style and and you know jokes about animals shooting themselves and and the fun music and stuff and it's just it's just like a sort of modern update on that old school
4521.84,4526.8, Beat them up like four player game like you might play in the arcade back in the day like teenage reading of tutorials
4527.360000000001,4534.4800000000005," This Simpsons. Yeah, something like that. You know, it sounds awesome good good good boss battles too. It is it is pretty awesome"
4534.4800000000005,4537.76," Yeah, the 15 dollars. Yeah, so it's red"
4538.24,4540.24, Red
4540.24,4546.16," Okay, cool. Well Luke any last words before we uh, we're gonna we don't even know who's calling next"
4546.16,4548.16, We're gonna we got some other
4548.16,4551.16, We got someone lined up for a five o'clock appointment with us
4552.04,4557.96," No, I mean I got us a mouth good luck to you Sean thanks thanks for calling him and I appreciate it"
4558.52,4563.360000000001, And it's a shame it's a shame that we never got you in the studio with us
4563.360000000001,4564.96, I know man
4565.04,4566.96, Brody
4566.96,4568.96," Good night, mate"
4570.56,4576.32, You said you said that like it was gonna be a surprise or something like but I'm pretty sure you said he was gonna call just five minutes ago
4576.56,4578.72, You already let it slip. I'm so high right now
4580.08,4586.8, I mean I mean I made I made Sean take five bunk heads before we came to make him nothing Ryan was the one pushing it on all of us
4587.36,4592.32, That's why Ryan Ryan like it was given to suck brownies this morning for the moment we walked in yeah
4592.639999999999,4595.139999999999, Ryan lives in a grow-up and dude it's
4598.08,4601.24, Why is that so sad that's why Ryan lives out of the city
4602.88,4609.679999999999," No, my friend a grow-up. That's that's a pretty common thing in the same Cisco. Oh shit. Oh for the next caller"

4653.84,4657.68, I want to talk to Anthony but he seems really wrapped up in dynasty worse 10
4659.76,4661.76, Do you wish you could talk to us all more often?

4758.24,4760.24, But I think it's that way in ventrilo too
4760.24,4765.84, But you ever watch it don't that just means everyone truth and it it just means that I smile and laugh a lot
4765.84,4770.16, And I say stupid things that make people think I'm under the influence of some mind-altering substance
4770.16,4772.16, But when I'm in actuality not
4773.04,4774.48, But okay wing wing
4774.48,4776.48, I don't let's start off wing wing is the star
4777.04,4782.16, of some I'm not sure is it Indian or self some self these stage in Filipino when we're in Filipino
4782.5599999999995,4784.5599999999995, He's Pinoi
4784.5599999999995,4790.0, Sounds like I'm making the substance I gotta see you ask why people think I'm high okay so wing wing is a primordial dwarf
4790.0,4795.36, They hailed from the Philippines and he started in action movies he he played a character that was known as double agent double
4795.36,4797.36, Low and it was
4797.36,4801.599999999999, The real story of wing wing and then go into the fake shit and it don't fuck it up
4801.599999999999,4803.36," Man, I'm doing my best you could take it"
4803.679999999999,4805.679999999999, You want to be the one to tell it you can tell it
4807.44,4811.12, You're gonna you can correct me then correct me every step of the way that I get rock so
4811.44,4815.5199999999995," Anyway, this guy played in j double load and this is how we found him in this YouTube videos of of him"
4815.839999999999,4816.88, jumping off of
4816.88,4822.799999999999, Skyscraper's and and opening an umbrella and landing and then maybe landing in a balcony if some other woman in
4822.799999999999,4826.0, Succing her up and then the escaping winner has been came home
4827.04,4831.759999999999, But we we were looking at this guy and we're trying to figure I mean he's very strange and bird like and we're trying to
4832.72,4838.08, Figure out what is his origins were right and just based on his morphology so it's kind of like
4838.88,4840.88, Reverse engineering
4840.88,4844.88, Just looking at him we figured out that rather than genitalia
4845.68,4849.68, He he me gentle he has a cloica and he's in danger of becoming a pregnant by
4850.96,4852.96, Uranating or defcating in a public restroom
4854.64,4858.64, He's playing this how how can you how like I may pick things up?
4859.76,4861.6," Okay, wait what"
4862.0,4869.360000000001," So I'm gonna pick stuff up in the bathroom. Okay. Yeah, because it's like a big it's like a big loose finger type opening"
4869.92,4871.92, Type or this I don't know
4873.68,4877.52, Come on see this is now now we're gonna lose people are gonna love y'all in hate wing
4877.52,4882.4800000000005, What else did this guy have we had his whole history well first okay first we found out that
4882.96,4886.56, There's two different ways that we found out that he ate I don't remember what the first one was
4887.12,4890.400000000001, But the second one was that the unhinged his jaw and ran by fruit cards
4891.76,4893.76, Oh
4897.4400000000005,4899.4400000000005, What's the other one
4899.4400000000005,4904.8, There's a bird there's a bird that does that's called the sheer water and that's I think what we figured out because of his
4905.68,4911.52, Is what is it called is his phenotypical resemblance to a sheer water and the sheer water is basically
4911.52,4916.72, Clip through the water and get you know fish and crustaceans and stuff that hang by the surface and continue to fly
4917.04,4922.56," We fit wing wing was very very mobile at the same time even though he had the sheer waters, you know facial structure"
4923.04,4926.4800000000005, So so wing wing would sort of run by a fruit cart
4927.76,4932.0, Remember to Southern and in times of live in times of scarcity
4932.400000000001,4935.52, We consisted on a diet of
4935.92,4938.72, Mungango of Mungango and D's nuts
4939.04,4943.04, Mungango is
4945.04,4947.360000000001, Mungango is a type of African nut and
4947.92,4950.08, Bush people such as the comb of the Kalahari
4950.8,4955.2," It's one of their principal, you know a component to their diet though the women in among the comb"
4955.2,4958.72, We're going to collect them so that's one of the types of nuts heat and the other type is D's
4960.88,4962.88, We decided that because it sounded red
4963.4400000000005,4968.96, What point I had like a whole list of facts what what we had his lifespan right?
4971.28,4976.24, I think we did I don't remember it now though was he in a mortal like Yoda or was he like a mosquito
4976.96,4980.88, We're actually like you'd blink and you'd be looking at wingways great great grandson
4985.84,4989.52, That's all great and everything but let's see some one make a make a me amount of wing wing
4990.4800000000005,4991.28, Wait
4991.44,4994.4, We gotta get this because this is what you guys do in your spare time or
4995.12,4996.4, Normally we do it
4997.599999999999,5004.719999999999, Games and bitch last night like Roy was going in saying we were playing company heroes and we're actually it's rare
5004.719999999999,5010.08, But we used the donkey the donkey cheat and I never told people how to do it
5010.08,5014.0, But basically you bring in a donkey that's got pans or dual pans or tricks on it and
5014.48,5017.36, Walking stuck a bombs and it can shit mines and sprint
5017.759999999999,5022.88, So but at the same time it's it's real easy to get you talk easy to kill okay
5022.88,5027.36, Let's break it down for Robert every time so man you walk in your hot spot
5027.36,5034.24, You don't know what's going on. Yeah Robert there's this game we play right it's a strategy and tactical game that involves the armies of
5034.799999999999,5038.96, America and Germany and World War II. I don't I don't appreciate your condescension
5039.36,5040.16, I
5040.16,5042.0, Stand about this motherfucking game
5042.8,5045.36, Hear about every every 30 minutes
5046.56,5051.84, Where that you could ride a donkey that shits mines and it sounded a little far fetched
5054.32,5057.68, It's so it's a cheat and it's in it was in the game
5057.68,5060.88, It's not a hack or anything. It's like something that we do was always there in the game
5060.88,5064.08, We don't have to like it's it's not bullshit or anything
5064.08,5069.84," It's there but no one knows it's up for us how to access the thing and yeah, it's like it's called what's it called the Esselstrec"
5070.08,5077.52," Yeah, it's a donkey with like all the all the features I I mentioned and it's like a great way to start a game because people are used to"
5078.0,5082.08," You know, it's technically games going phases and you're used to encountering only a certain"
5082.56,5087.04, Level of technology and any given time and like the first thing the round starts and there's like
5087.68,5092.64, Bombs falling from the sky on them and then they run up to see what's going on or like maybe they bring like a
5092.88,5098.64, A brand carrier which is a light track to vehicle that you just put guys in machine gun in and then it just gets blown up instantly by a donkey
5098.96,5101.52, And then you see the donkey run away
5102.0,5107.52," Like they immediately get angry, but we are playing normally the dog I mean it's like right if you have the dog"
5107.52,5112.88, You should win but everyone has set the brits can access it so if Americans are playing they can have it
5112.88,5116.72, And in this case it was too brits on the other side and the way the game is balanced right now
5117.04,5122.240000000001, It's like we had to concede it took us a while especially me and Anthony because we love playing as the British
5122.8,5125.12, But but they're a they're a baby army
5125.36,5126.5599999999995, They're like
5126.5599999999995,5133.94, They don't take the finesse and skill and and thoughtfulness that it takes to succeed with the other armies and it's largely because they they can build these
5134.14,5136.14, Placements for relatively
5136.64,5143.36, In significant amounts of manpower fuel sometimes no fuel they have you know low requirements on your total population cap
5143.36,5147.44, I mean even if you aren't familiar with these things just know that they're they're easy to make right and
5148.08,5153.44, Once you play some there there are hardest held a kill and we're playing these guys that sucked it was so everything they were doing was wrong
5153.599999999999,5156.48, They lose every infantry battle everything was just like
5156.96,5162.259999999999, Clear that these guys were not like ready for it and they just kept making these goddamn
5162.46,5166.639999999999, In placements all through the town are playing the snap linden and it's like a machine gun here
5166.639999999999,5172.36, AT gun here you put a mortar here put two more machine guns here doesn't matter and like you'd come in with
5172.96,5178.799999999999, These especially design crews you know is playing against it say like these I'm gonna design guys to destroy these in placements
5178.8,5184.320000000001, And I'd come in and I'd get hurt just enough where I'd have to retreat back to like the halfway point where I had a
5184.4800000000005,5190.84, Medstation set up as soon as I would heal and go back in you continue clearing the guys shit out he had made more but I mean
5191.6,5194.16, This is when Roy usually starts screaming and shit and
5195.360000000001,5197.76, Like the only meat you do it. Oh my god
5199.6,5205.4400000000005, Although I played I played in a few games with Roy and I seem to remember him getting very angry
5205.599999999999,5211.639999999999, Being on the losing end of the team fortress to match everyone gets mad from time to time
5211.639999999999,5216.4, I've I've had everyone snap at me and couldn't you and I've snapped it a few people too
5216.4,5219.28, So I seem to remember some rage quitting going on from Sean
5219.28,5225.879999999999, I've Anthony you can back him up. You know I get just the same degree and if I I'll just sit there complaining about the fucking
5225.879999999999,5230.2, Enplacement over and over again and then as soon as we're done let's play can new games up guys get in
5230.599999999999,5233.4, Not just that but Sean has his talk button on
5233.4,5238.44, Like one of his side mouse buttons so like I always have to listen to him angry breathe after he ran to about something
5240.44,5244.719999999999," Shit, I didn't know dude. Let's we want to get into me and talk about bad ventrilo habits"
5245.28,5251.5199999999995," Well, we've been talking about that for a while. There's been stuff, you know"
5251.879999999999,5253.32, There's been a
5253.5599999999995,5256.879999999999, Do you need to take that I'll call her back. I think that might be another
5257.0,5260.82," It's not another call for now, but I think it's someone that will want to call later"
5260.82,5267.219999999999, I was thinking about it for a while now trying to decide if I was gonna try and fart on the mic while my well
5267.219999999999,5272.74," Rory was was in the room with us, but I'm not going to obviously I did decide there was one time Rory"
5272.74,5274.099999999999, Let's break it home
5274.099999999999,5276.74, Anthony said he was done playing for the night
5277.62,5280.0199999999995, He apparently left his microphone on
5280.74,5282.74, Apparently didn't leave the computer
5283.299999999999,5287.38, Because we heard a huffin and a puffin and a slap in and a whack in
5288.34,5293.7," All while we continue to play and immediately met James what's up, Rory?"
5293.7,5295.7, I wanted to keep that quiet
5295.7,5300.5, This is like so not right for you to reveal this on the fucking air dude. It's we got to do it man
5300.5,5305.78, It wasn't so much the the whack in and the huffin and the puffin. It was the sound of that horse just
5309.9400000000005,5313.54, Like immediately I think it was dark in a jam as they were so embarrassed
5313.54,5317.7, So I fucked this and they got out there like we're getting out of of the thing for the night
5318.18,5322.1, In Rory and I had this perverse like need to just check this shit out
5325.14,5329.7, Sorry everyone. I'm totally making this up. That's it. That was a lie everything except for the horse
5329.7,5334.42, I apologize I got a fish to talk button. I don't I don't ever use caps lock when I'm looking up porn
5334.9,5336.9, I
5338.58,5342.18, Was that beep that was my voice mail
5343.22,5344.42, So it's leaving
5344.42,5352.58," Rory's never on the show. You should talk more ask me about it. Well, I'm kind of yeah talk worry, but I'm kind of like I know you get nervous because he's never been like"
5352.58,5355.06," Yes, so I'm trying to tell us about Warhammer online"
5356.02,5359.22," No, oh shit that's"
5359.46,5362.1, That's true tell us about it. Give us a preview of your preview
5363.06,5369.54," A preview of my preview yeah, I would you go about doing that. I don't know tell us what you've been doing what's the game like"
5370.26,5371.46, You are you a door?
5371.46,5374.34," Brad's in the beginning. No, I'm not an org are you a door?"
5375.38,5377.620000000001, What that no oh what the hell are you?
5379.38,5384.42, It's a fucking hell. We wait wait wait wait. We we're all talking over each other. Why aren't you an org?
5385.46,5390.820000000001, I'm not an org because the Warhammer orks and Anthony can also backing up on this that should have said
5391.299999999999,5397.94, If anyone the series is to be an org in that game. I don't know. I don't know man. What's up with them?
5397.94,5405.62, I like you ever seen okay Anthony back me up on this real what are the orgs talk like in in Warhammer soccer who begins
5406.74,5410.74, Anthony through some more speed uh we should go to get to him bush

5458.9,5463.46, For hours on end it might as well be like a female as if you make it like the most always
5463.46,5464.82, The acute you just got
5466.099999999999,5468.099999999999, Doesn't have to have variation to it

5679.46,5687.06," Well, he he came in I mean's rude with a legend I'm assuming sadly that people know the basics about him from a previous podcast"
5687.14,5690.580000000001," But um and you know, so yeah, he was talking to us and and"
5691.3,5693.860000000001, For some reasons it came up that he was broke
5693.860000000001,5696.1, I don't know why he was like he wanted some game
5696.1,5701.3, We're gonna switch to some other game perhaps this seems like a good enough story and he didn't have it for whatever reason
5701.3,5704.5, I was like it's like cheap. I don't you just get it and he's broke because
5705.14,5708.34, He loaned all the savings to a friend to buy a car
5709.06,5713.46, Specifically for the purpose of driving to his own wedding and then I want to ask them
5713.62,5717.3," Car though, it's just like an alternator for a car or something you gave him $3,000 for it"
5717.3,5722.58," Oh, you had to get it fixed. That's right and then when I asked him wouldn't have been cheaper to give him money to get a cab"
5723.06,5728.66, He had some excuse for that and then when I asked him like why didn't you just drive him to the thing?
5728.66,5733.94, He had some like equally fucked up excuse for that and we were really trying to figure out what happened to the money
5733.94,5737.86, And at the end I really don't know like if it went to like phone sex or what but it was like
5739.3,5740.82, Something wasn't right about it
5744.02,5746.02, This is possible
5747.3,5750.58," Yeah, all right, so manion"
5751.86,5753.86, Thank you for calling
5754.34,5761.94," No, it's been a good disaster. We're about to get a call now. We're going into entirely unknown territory. We're getting calls from people who"
5763.7,5766.9, We don't know never talk to we're gonna have to see how this goes
5767.46,5769.46, All right
5769.78,5771.78, Time delay
5774.18,5781.14, The funny thing is the whole time he was on the phone. I was picturing his little icon on his little avatar on the one up
5781.14,5783.74, I don't even know if it's the same when he has anymore of the guy rock life
5783.74,5784.74, I
5784.74,5787.94," Yeah, I just imagine you that guy talking to me the whole"
5788.9,5793.56," Yeah, that happens with like people that you only know on internet forums and stuff like you"
5793.56,5796.46," They're having just just think of their avatar. Yeah, that's weird"
5796.54,5802.22, That's exactly like how I know most of people on all our forums. It's like it's like the combination of their name and the avatar
5802.22,5806.94, You say one or visualize the other and then the other you complete the picture. Yeah
5808.38,5810.38, Some good ones on there
5810.94,5814.86, So now we're gonna be like the Maytag people. We're just gonna say here quite we until the phone rings
5815.58,5820.22, I should have drank some coffee. She gave people more advice on getting into the industry
5820.46,5823.46," No, you don't want to get into this industry. Go do something"
5823.46,5830.94," Oh, we could we could continue that I mean there's there's definitely more to say there. Yeah, I didn't know anyone"
5830.94,5832.58, I just
5832.58,5838.78, Started my own blog and wrote on that for a year and tried to get his matriding experience my own as I could and then I started doing
5839.58,5844.74, Free work for some random handheld side just a bunch of shit that I could put on my resume and then when I saw an opening
5844.74,5847.54, I applied for an internship and then you just have to
5847.78,5851.78, Once you're there you have to have a willingness to learn. I guess is the biggest thing that helped me out
5852.179999999999,5856.34," Because I don't pretend my writing was super good, but pretty much exactly what I did"
5856.74,5860.58," Another basic thing if you guys agree, but it would be to read"
5861.54,5867.86, As much as possible and also like reading but don't read not necessarily reading other writing about games
5867.86,5871.3, I mean that's not said that there's not plenty of like fantastic stuff
5871.54,5874.9, I mean there's there's an enormous amount of excellent writing about games out there
5874.9,5880.259999999999, But I think that it's easier to just grab like a quality magazine or book and pay as much attention to those
5881.22,5886.02, And I don't get into the trap of thinking that you need to replicate with like you know
5887.14,5889.7, Total fidelity what you're seeing online now
5890.26,5893.7, I mean just like like I mean has to do it. It's kind of hard because I mean
5894.18,5896.74, Normally to get a foot what happens when you get in the foot in the door
5896.74,5902.18, I think a lot of editors are are more comfortable with people that they know can just like write how style or that are going to be
5902.18,5907.46, predictable. They know exactly what to expect from them and then maybe it's like you kind of get the luxury of
5907.7,5909.7, Working on your own voice after that
5910.820000000001,5912.18, Um
5912.18,5913.54," Oh, there we go"
5913.54,5916.58, You think he's got a story. You want me to start reading this?
5916.58,5920.9800000000005," Yeah, go ahead and read that, but yeah, I mean we'll just just finish that thoughts about just hanging there. I mean what you guys agree?"
5922.1,5924.1," Yeah, I mean boost your gold down then"
5925.3,5930.02, I mean I think if you're gonna write for living you probably want to be into reading stories
5930.02,5934.26," How you know yeah, all right now we have a I don't know"
5935.54,5937.54," Hey, yeah"
5937.86,5942.26, Hello and welcome to GFW radio
5943.46,5946.34, Who is this this is Chris Tilton aka
5946.34,5951.06, Volk comeback from the board okay from the one-up forms or the Neo-Gat forms. What up?
5951.06,5956.5, Okay awesome. That's what we like so how you doing man? I'm doing good. How are you?
5956.9,5962.1, We're just we're just putting the the fork in the GFW radio the brodo for the last time
5962.82,5964.82, Oh boy
5965.219999999999,5968.82, That's that time man how long have you listened to this show?
5969.54,5973.46," Uh, since the very first one where you guys were winding and complaining about having to do it"
5973.78,5979.86, Seriously you listen since since you didn't have to go back and check it out. I mean like when that one came out you you downloaded it
5980.179999999999,5984.66, No because I had been listening to one of yours before all the other podcasts started so
5985.0599999999995,5987.0599999999995, What the other one started popping up?
5987.62,5989.62, Start listening to them
5989.62,5992.099999999999, So you give us your perspective. I mean you've got like a
5992.820000000001,5998.42, A cleaner point of view on it. I mean how did we change much over the over the years that we recorded? I mean did
5999.620000000001,6005.54, I mean it definitely took a little while to get into like the group doing things but I think once you established
6006.26,6007.22, You know
6007.22,6010.02, Talk about whatever kind of go up on tangent
6010.58,6011.860000000001, Saying you know
6011.860000000001,6016.02, I would say that once it reached you know a city kind of saying just kind of
6016.34,6020.58, Things like say the same and he'd go in out your phases of like you're in the web or doing rapture whatever
6021.22,6026.66, For the most part you know it's okay. You can say that it wasn't any good into the first one that I came on
6028.0199999999995,6032.58, I mean it wasn't I mean I didn't hear any of the other ones. I didn't hear it at all before I came
6032.58,6038.66, You never listened to a signal for a fact that by with the first one that I went on that was the first one that was worth hearing
6039.14,6042.18, Did you ever listen to one that you were on? No
6043.3,6047.7," Okay, I've checked points out. I've checked I've never listened to whole one"
6047.7,6054.0199999999995," But I've checked things out where sometimes it's a matter if like oh, did I sound like an idiot there or what happened or so"
6054.0199999999995,6059.139999999999, And or Jeff might have been concerned that he came across in a way he wasn't intending to and
6059.62,6064.42, Wanted me to I mean you skip who's recording this and knows that to you I mean sometimes we'll tape and we'll be like
6064.98,6069.0599999999995, That was horrible. I mean there have been a few times when we've taped and we've finished it
6069.0599999999995,6070.42, We've said it was horrible and we were
6070.66,6076.5, We stood by that and we at the end on a second listing where I like it that did suck and then there were other times when we left and said
6076.5,6081.22, That was a total fucking train wreck and for whatever reason people seemed to like it just about more than anything else
6081.22,6083.22, I've definitely had that
6083.78,6086.34, That feeling like coming out of here like oh god
6086.34,6088.34, That was horrible like are they really good?
6088.34,6093.3, You know what you got a lot of a train wreck you know a lot of times I'm listening to the car and like
6094.02,6098.98, City LA traffic and a train wreck is way more detained with the heck I was I'm currently doing
6099.54,6102.98," Yeah, did you how many podcasts do you listen to?"
6104.02,6106.02, way too many
6106.02,6110.1, Where you tended to get like the majority of your sort of like you're gaming you know
6110.660000000001,6115.9400000000005, Media or do you spend an equal amount of time you know reading stories on the websites and reading print magazines?
6116.26,6118.26, I like to read the stories
6118.42,6121.700000000001, On the web I I don't really like read preview that much
6122.580000000001,6124.580000000001, Because you know I mean
6124.820000000001,6129.22, If I'm looking forward to getting my generally don't like to read about it all that but it's until I can't play it
6129.46,6131.46," Yeah, but you know I mean"
6132.1,6137.94, I listen to almost all the work podcast and also idea and and a couple of you know others but
6139.14,6142.58, Maybe you do you think that's fair then because a lot of times on all of our podcasts
6142.58,6147.38, We do the equipment of previews and we talking pretty good detail about games before they come out
6147.86,6152.66, But I mean if you're fine with hearing it there. I mean it was I just makes me wonder if maybe there's something else that
6153.38,6156.34, I was hearing it when it's like a discussion back and forth
6158.42,6160.42, You know what I mean right that makes sense
6160.9800000000005,6164.34, Do you think that that perhaps people are a bit more like I mean?
6164.34,6167.38, I'm kind of just generalizing but but maybe people are more straightforward and
6168.02,6172.42, And honest with their impressions on something in you know in a dialogue format than they might be in print
6172.66,6175.3," Yeah, absolutely you don't have time to go back and read read what you wrote"
6176.66,6180.34," Yeah, I mean I can't I can't even count the number of times I've just bullshit on this show"
6180.9,6182.9, I didn't actually have an opinion I just had to make it up
6185.3,6186.74, As you each are as I
6186.74,6188.74, In can crunch
6189.219999999999,6192.42, Eating as part of this show. Do you have any questions for us?
6193.139999999999,6199.219999999999," Well, I do I think specifically you for you Sean since you you and Jeff for some of them are"
6199.94,6201.94, Outspoken and critical guys
6201.94,6206.66, You know as especially recently and and I'm wondering if you're gonna really
6207.46,6212.9, Carry that I mean you scrutinize things you you really delve into what what's making something work
6212.9,6218.5, What's not working what can make it better? Are you really gonna go in with that you know aggressive attitude?
6218.82,6220.82, In the development because
6221.46,6223.86, Because there's a lot there's not too many you guys
6224.9,6229.54, You know tell on the public all these things when you when you're in the development we're not gonna hear this stuff anymore
6230.58,6232.58, I think I mean
6232.58,6236.9, Of course it's easy enough to say now because I haven't actually started but I couldn't imagine doing anything else
6236.9,6239.78, I mean I don't see what I mean there's a few things to know here right
6239.78,6244.26, I mean I'm not gonna be able to go into to to K-Boss and and act like I'm I'm King Dick
6244.58,6248.42, I mean I'm there to learn and and there's a whole lot that I'm gonna be learning and
6248.74,6252.42, You know there's it's gonna be intimidating. I'm sure being around some of the people who have you know such a
6252.98,6257.62, You know hands-on perspective and stuff but at the same time if I'm I'm I'm playing something or looking at it
6258.5,6263.38, And I feel that whatever it is you know like whatever it is that I think could it could work better
6263.38,6270.0199999999995, Whatever of course I'm going to give my opinion exactly the same way that I would if it were someone else's game or something like that
6270.0199999999995,6273.78, I mean I think when you start lying to yourself and I assume that everyone you know
6273.78,6278.58," Don't talk for him just yet, but I assume that they're all agree when you're bullshitting yourself is when you get in a real trouble"
6279.46,6285.219999999999, When you convince yourself that you made the greatest thing ever and that it there's there's no way to improve it
6285.38,6291.46," So I guess I mean the the short version is like yeah, I hope to be just as critical as ever the trick actually is you know"
6291.46,6292.66, I know
6292.66,6294.66, Is that
6294.66,6296.74, To be analytical on at the same time you know
6296.74,6298.259999999999, I mean a long time ago
6298.5,6304.1, Luke Luke Smith was on the phone with a serlier and he brought up something that I was you know when I was talking about gears of war when it first came out
6304.1,6308.9800000000005, And specifically about the way that the levels were designed and that the bottlenecks were placed in and how
6309.22,6314.26, This one particular box that that was just a really sloppy bottleneck because it was super visible and it
6314.66,6321.62, Serve no other purpose than just being a really visible don't be bottleneck and when I brought that up and a few other things Mark Rain from epic
6321.62,6323.62, Kind of accused me of
6323.62,6329.7, Being the guy who's tearing the curtain down behind the magic shield pointing and saying like a ha look there's like wires and pullies back here
6330.5,6335.38, When I was trying to argue that to the contrary for for me at least it was that
6335.86,6342.98, Sort of his trousers fell down and and the rabbits and the cards and you know the devs just sort of like came out and the trick though is to
6343.46,6351.14, To be able to do that to I think to be able to understand how the tricks working but it's still not lose the delight in the trick in the first place and I think that's totally
6351.780000000001,6359.9400000000005, Like I don't know I think that's fairly easy for me to do it's like I understanding how something functions doesn't take away the magic of it and the least bit
6360.62,6362.62," Yeah, I mean just understanding it"
6363.46,6367.9400000000005, Has you know not necessarily direct correlation with how fun it is. Yeah
6369.26,6376.42," So what did I answer all that question the other yeah, I mean he's basically you are approaching in development from a different perspective"
6376.66,6381.78," Oh, a lot of people who you know move up in the industry because you're so outspoken people people know"
6382.42,6387.22, What you've said in the past and and how you criticize games? So they kind of know what they're gonna get
6387.22,6393.22, So I think people are gonna ask for your opinion more than so then you know someone who hasn't been in game journalism
6393.22,6399.62, Right I I agree that I have a different perspective and I hope to make an asset of that in so far as I mean
6400.5,6403.14, I'm also I'm also familiar with just how things work
6403.14,6406.02, You know say for example a lot of times developers will come by with a preview game
6406.74,6411.7," And we'll all look at it and I'm not just talking about you know my colleagues here, but just the industry in general of all the times"
6411.7,6413.7, I've seen you demonstrations of games and stuff
6414.58,6421.14, You'll see something and they'll ask you what you think of it and everyone's kind of polite and they'll you'll see that on their faces
6421.14,6428.5, That maybe they aren't all that impressed and that you know something's not sitting right with them and then the the people will leave and they'll
6429.06,6434.34, Hey great seeing you and everything and then it's like the previous come out and then you start getting emails back from like
6434.34,6439.06," Hey, you guys seem like you really really loved it when we brought it by like what's all this all of a sudden?"
6439.06,6446.58, You know now you're saying that this was like boring and shitty and you can't imagine this aspect because the game being more entertaining for more in 15 minutes at time
6447.14,6452.42, Like why didn't you say something there and like I've always encouraged that but just I mean that would be an example of
6453.78,6459.7, Like I mean I just knowing how things work on on on that end and and like what to take serious and
6460.5,6464.74, I don't know I kind of messed that up like I think I had a point there and it was just like that
6466.0199999999995,6468.0199999999995, I mean
6468.0199999999995,6470.0199999999995, I don't know what am I trying to say?
6470.0199999999995,6472.0199999999995," Well, I do have one other short question"
6473.0599999999995,6474.0199999999995, One other thing
6474.0199999999995,6481.62, I'm gonna I'm gonna have a good excuse for quick pre-answer that I was messing with my phone because I was using as a clock to check to keep track of the time and
6482.26,6486.26, In the past like five minutes my phone apparently broke and is scrambled
6486.66,6490.900000000001, So I'm kind of like distracted on that. I was showing it to skis keep a minute ago. It's like screwed up
6491.3,6494.18," But okay, there's Mike's queues. So what's the other question?"
6495.22,6496.9800000000005, Well
6496.9800000000005,6500.74, How important do you think it is to be really really critical of games?
6500.74,6506.820000000001, I mean on the one hand you know as I said then no to you like I really hate when people say in our view or
6507.22,6510.74, Or when they're competing something say what's really good for a game?
6510.9800000000005,6514.26, It's like you just don't really good or it's not too care that it's a game
6514.900000000001,6521.62, And you know particularly when it comes to writing and how how important do you feel it is to be critical of that because
6522.18,6524.18, It seems like most people that
6524.34,6530.74, Play games now are the casual people that don't give a crap right what imagine most people that bought brands up thought of for
6531.38,6534.42, Just bought it so they could drive around running over people and messing around
6535.860000000001,6541.3," Yeah, I think I would like the interest in having everyone answer this but I think for me. It's not a matter of like being"
6542.1,6546.42," I mean, I don't think it's important to be really super critical and so far as like I mean"
6546.42,6550.26, I what I what I think you mean by critical is like as the word pertains to criticism
6551.14,6554.74, More than being you know harsh or skating because being harsh or skating
6554.74,6558.1, I don't think that really matters because I mean especially when you're not super
6558.58,6563.46, When you're not looking at the the point purpose of a view is being like a buyer's guide or a thumbs-up or thumbs down
6563.46,6565.46, I mean I think you can almost provide that separately
6565.9400000000005,6569.22, But but but being critical of it and the other respect
6569.22,6573.9400000000005, I think is super important just for me for the entertainment factor just to find someone reading my story
6573.9400000000005,6580.58, It's like I got I hope I'm not just saying the same thing that you're gonna get everywhere everywhere else with just different word it wording you know
6581.54,6585.06, And I think for I think the interesting question is understanding
6586.02,6591.780000000001, Why we're spending our time and money on these things more so than whether or not we should or shouldn't do that you know
6591.780000000001,6593.780000000001, I've said this before also and
6594.34,6596.18, And it's like as soon as you get into that
6596.26,6598.18, I think it's just fun and it's interesting you know
6598.18,6601.38, I'm always interested and whenever I'm talking to someone about a game
6602.1,6603.62, It's so clear
6603.62,6608.34, When someone has some what I think is as a genuine insight on because I immediately snap to attention
6608.34,6612.02, It's like I'm like totally listening this is like giving me a whole new
6612.740000000001,6617.700000000001, Lens through which to understand my experience with the game and the game itself and something becomes fascinating
6617.700000000001,6619.46, But if it's just the usual discussion of like
6620.1,6625.22, You know talk talk about this a lot of the graphics are this and that and all these just the kind of like
6625.62,6630.02, Peas and carrot to approach to a game like a TV dinner or you know on a TV dinner you got a apartment
6630.02,6636.26, You got your dessert over here and you've got your like me loaf in the middle and you just like give a little discussion about each one of these isn't rather than
6637.14,6643.7, Like you're saying instead of it being just a game or instead of it being just a TV dinner and the analogy would be just like a well
6643.860000000001,6649.3, Prepared meal and everything is working together and some different aspect and the experience of eating it
6650.34,6652.34, That was a great metaphor
6652.34,6659.38," You're going the distance with that metaphor. Yeah, yeah, the TV the TV dinner metaphor actually"
6660.02,6664.9800000000005, has mutated from when a teacher in art school first gave it to me and that was that
6665.78,6668.02, When I was doing figure figure drawings
6668.42,6674.5, I would start on a limb or head or something and just move out from there and just go and cover every part
6675.38,6677.78, And the teacher would come up and want to slap my hand and say
6678.259999999999,6684.34, It's not a TV dinner. You don't like don't draw the piece and then the carrots. It's like look at this is an entire body and
6684.58,6691.54, How everything is coming together and how the musculature and the skeletons you know the skeleton and everything else is coming
6691.86,6697.38, To produce a single entity and work your way around the entire thing and think see it all once rather than
6697.54,6700.9, Starting in one little point and then coming out from there and having a picture appear
6700.9,6707.139999999999, Although that's totally your personality like you're totally you've always been the kind of person to
6707.62,6713.700000000001, Automatically go in and break something down as finally as possible like you're you're just always like
6714.18,6716.18, Working on something in that way like
6716.740000000001,6723.3, Like pulling it apart and seeing how it works and but but it's not just like atomizing it so that you're you're reducing it to just these
6723.62,6728.660000000001," Component parts, but I mean I always still try to understand how those components are interacting with one another"
6728.660000000001,6734.14," Yeah, yeah, so I mean like I agree and it was actually you're into the parts you're like a tweeter on a bicycle"
6734.46,6738.14, When the teacher told me that I had to admit that that's actually how I eat my meals
6738.14,6745.1," I start on one thing and I do one at a time, you know, yeah, but as long as I mean I'm not losing sight of the"
6745.26,6750.9400000000005," Interrelationship of the parts yeah, so I'm fine with that so we've already gone over time"
6751.5,6755.18," Okay, I got another person was to call yeah, thanks for calling men"
6756.700000000001,6761.34," Okay, all right, later. All right, later. I thought other guy calls cool if he doesn't for now"
6761.42,6764.9400000000005," I guess you want me to read oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, well, let's give the origin of this"
6765.42,6769.74, We really wanted Miguel Lopez. He now works at games by he was a former zif davis employee
6770.7,6777.02, To join us today he couldn't convince his bosses that it was a good thing for him to come over and be on the final gift
6777.02,6780.06, W but among other things. I mean Miguel is super funny
6780.06,6783.74, Super interesting guy. I was really interested in getting hints perspective on the industry
6784.14,6787.58, But he's also got some fucked up stories and so this one isn't in
6788.14,6792.62," Printed out from an instant message you sent me. Okay, and Anthony's just gonna break it down"
6793.98,6795.98, One night we were at my friend's house
6796.7,6801.82, This was before I moved out here right around the time of the Star Wars movies where you released
6802.14,6808.7, What why is he I just want to set Miguel's Q-wind? I know I don't have turning in my life like speeding himself
6809.42,6814.14, It's just a one of the only voices I got anyways out of three of mine. I'm always all right
6814.54,6818.3, This guy lived in a housing project with his brother the place was under their mom's name
6818.3,6822.860000000001, But she went off to live with her man and left them to live in the project apartment on their own
6823.18,6829.1, So basically the place was nasty his fuck two bathrooms that night I go into the big bathroom and see fossilized
6829.1,6833.660000000001, Terred stuck to the toilet one thing leads to another in the fossilized third find its way
6834.14,6841.02, Finds its way into an empty canopy in the sausages. It's hard as fuck crumbling and we all force each other take waste of it
6841.9800000000005,6845.18, Five minutes later all of us in the house
6845.18,6851.580000000001," No, you got the van point five minutes. I spilled the shit off five minutes later all of us are in the house"
6851.580000000001,6853.580000000001, Are daring each other to do shit with the third
6855.42,6860.780000000001, One of the brothers in the house crazy in the Star Wars sleeps on a grimy Empire Strikes back comforter
6861.1,6863.26," Stolver emotional banner from Taco Bokec, et cetera"
6863.660000000001,6867.820000000001, By this point we had cut the fossilized third with Marjor in order to make it more spreadable
6867.9,6869.9, Oh
6871.5,6877.74, There were there were like five of us hanging out the night and we actually got the guy to wait agreed to spread the shit all over his face chest
6879.74,6883.259999999999, For a bunch of Star Wars memorabilia
6885.66,6889.9, People any that match it and he walked village 12 and stormed you for any
6889.9,6891.9, Watch it
6892.0599999999995,6897.099999999999, At your pocket band at Lair figure carrier. I like I like it. He says mad shit like that. This is something
6897.099999999999,6900.219999999999, I mean it was worthwhile people throughout and he walked really
6902.219999999999,6906.94, But not only did he spread the shit on his face and body making a smiley face pattern on his nipples and good
6907.42,6910.62, We also got him to agree to drive through Taco Bell in order some food
6911.0199999999995,6916.0599999999995, So we get my friend station wagon whose power windows are stuck in the closed position and drive to talk about
6916.22,6921.02, They're like doing a Dutch they're volunteering to do a Dutch oven with this like shit monster
6922.22,6924.22, And make a run for the border
6925.820000000001,6929.34, My friend with the shit on his face driving we have more to a chelita
6929.820000000001,6935.820000000001, When we drive by to pick it up the employees of course looks sketched out when we finally pull away one of my friends pulls the e-break
6935.9800000000005,6940.3, And makes the one with the shit on his face walk out of the car up to the drive through window and ask for a she-act
6940.3,6944.22, Check-pots us the employees just dropped it on the ground then we drove home
6944.7,6951.26, The end but then it says share that story with the world the tragedy of a man who was willing to let George Lucas take a shit on his face
6953.66,6955.66, I'm sure he wasn't the first
6956.38,6958.38, Wow
6958.38,6960.860000000001, So we can only imagine we go we would not forgive you
6961.58,6963.18, Wow
6963.18,6968.62, So I definitely budgeted these calls could have been quicker than I was trying to budget I was like I honestly don't know
6968.860000000001,6973.740000000001, I lose track it's like I get to be if if we ended up losing the new gift guys sorry about that
6974.3,6979.5, Just some calls went weird. I was thinking last night about how oh yeah
6979.5,6983.5, He's supposed to call in at five if it was busy. He can call back. Well
6983.900000000001,6986.14, Either way in a couple minutes. We have a call from
6986.7,6991.9800000000005, In the meantime I was just gonna say I was this is a random thought but I was thinking last night while was laying in bed
6992.46,6997.900000000001, How the experience of being a gamer these days has changed since when I was a kid
6998.379999999999,7005.5, Like I mean I got an intendo when I was seven years old and it was before anyone rented games of course and I was
7005.66,7009.5, You know coming from family with not very much money so for a year
7009.5,7011.5, I had an intendo and
7011.5,7015.66, Super Mario Brothers and there was no other game like there was no renting games
7015.66,7020.94, There's nobody I knew had an intendo the fact that I had one was like a major draw for for friends
7020.94,7024.7," So you have the robotic operating buddy. No, I did it was just the Mario machine"
7024.78,7031.179999999999, The Mario machine and I was remembering about how I had to make up all these extra games to play on top of
7031.42,7035.26, Super Mario Brothers like I would play Super Mario Brothers Ninja style
7035.82,7040.0599999999995, Which meant that I would I would hop around and basically play it like it was a stealth game
7040.0599999999995,7046.38, I couldn't kill anyone I had to always avoid you know what's happening right now what I've totally interested in the story
7046.38,7050.3, You're gonna continue it but you know when you're listening like NPR something and like once a
7050.3,7057.26, Re5 months they got to like do a fucking pledge drive and so they have like the pledge drive show and they're all sitting there waiting for the phone to ring
7057.26,7063.26," Because they want that motherfucking money, but then they got to pretend that they got to carry the show on until the phone rings and so while it's going"
7063.26,7065.26, They act like you know
7065.26,7067.26, Starting a dish with this such a gift
7067.26,7072.54, I listen every more and it keeps me informed it gives me the information and then bring
7072.860000000001,7076.3," And suddenly yeah, you don't give a shit about finish in that story"
7077.26,7081.9800000000005," I don't give a shit about we were basically there, but I was there we go. Oh shit. We got a pledge"
7082.78,7085.9800000000005, smile and dial ask him how much they're gonna pledge to the brudia
7087.820000000001,7090.9400000000005," You ready I like how we get quiet. Yeah, we're ready"
7093.02,7095.02, We don't have to be quiet
7095.02,7097.02, And walk and talk
7097.58,7099.58," Hey man, welcome to the brudia"
7100.9400000000005,7102.9400000000005, We're all alone with you
7106.46,7108.46, Is this a rock god or dark rays
7108.860000000001,7112.22," This is rock god, what happened to get? We're just ripping bongs bro"
7113.820000000001,7116.54," No, you don't ride across the bridge man. It's a drive down there"
7118.62,7121.74," So yeah, we're just sitting here and answer and calls and"
7122.46,7125.26, Doing the usual brody-o thing and that right now
7125.58,7130.3, We were just comparing right now the whole thing of like this the first time you know we've had people call in
7130.7,7133.1, And we're kind of like filling the gaps in between the calls by
7133.5,7136.860000000001, Telling stories and they're step rising and it's kind of like when you have a um
7138.620000000001,7140.14," I'm high man. No, I"
7141.18,7146.620000000001," Keep saying that people are gonna think yeah, so if it's like a wood public radio has a pledge drive or something"
7146.620000000001,7150.14," So anyway, remember to tell the story, but we're glad you interrupted it because it was making me upset"
7151.900000000001,7153.900000000001, Jesus
7154.620000000001,7156.620000000001," Yeah, so what's up man"
7156.620000000001,7158.620000000001, Did you uh well you know
7159.58,7162.3, Earth the news just like everybody else did and you know
7163.18,7165.98, Can't uh can't say that I'm not shocked
7167.0199999999995,7168.22, But
7168.22,7170.62, I'm definitely glad that you're moving on to doing something that
7171.34,7174.62, More than likely you've been playing on doing for a while man so uh just wanted to say
7175.18,7179.26, For actually the behalf of me and and all the squadron of shame folks that are in the community
7179.82,7182.46, Thanks for all the last man's been incredible. I mean
7183.0199999999995,7185.26, You still be radio is by far in a way
7186.14,7188.14, My favorite podcast out there. It's
7188.62,7191.98, been a huge inspiration to the squadron of shame's podcast and
7193.099999999999,7195.74, We try to to carry on the
7196.86,7203.58, You know you guys really you you've really pushed forward the idea of review versus critique and we
7204.54,7208.54, I mean we're we're very much appreciative of the critique as opposed to review
7209.34,7212.94, You know you guys have always done that and uh and also a dick jokes
7213.82,7218.38," What that absolutely yeah, I was I was I was talking to beige before I called"
7218.7,7220.7, You guys and
7220.7,7222.7, Superstar beach
7222.7,7224.7, Superstar
7224.7,7230.38, You want to me to say that when it came to GFW radio it came for the fart but it stayed for the commentary
7231.42,7234.54, That's good do that that's what I can I can be happy with that
7235.5,7239.66, With the description is one up that DNA that Chanel and Jeff Greener gone
7240.94,7245.82, What that is one up dead. Do you now that Chanel and Jeff Greener gone there's no point coming down site
7246.38,7252.0599999999995, Chuff is making make it a sad face when you say this so say the right thing and tell them no that he's the next generation
7252.62,7254.62, That's right
7254.78,7259.42," Now it's definitely not dead, but uh it's a lesser being"
7263.34,7265.34, So it's a basically to zombie
7266.62,7269.98, It's a zombie that is trolling around the streets for clicks
7275.82,7283.58," I do not I do not endorse this message what you're leaving dude. Yeah, but I was like I was tied to a chair and like I"
7284.139999999999,7290.0599999999995," I'm I'm still in the phase where like yeah, I'm handcuffed. I got two black guys and I'm like telling mom that"
7290.46,7292.46, Things are great here in her night
7293.179999999999,7297.099999999999," Thanks, they're they're treating me good. No, I'm just playing dude. I'm totally joking about that to you"
7298.38,7302.54," Yeah, you need a bit see I get a Robert Kirkman maybe he can do a spin-out series"
7302.62,7308.06," Oh, that reminds me. I'm like one of these days. I'm gonna have to like email Kirkman and try to like"
7308.62,7312.86, You know pitch him on the comic book that I've been doing and I'm determined now so you had this thing
7313.34,7319.82, When before I started writing before I started getting paid to write I would write on my free time nonstop
7319.82,7321.34, I mean short fiction
7321.58,7327.0199999999995, Sort of like creative nonfiction all sorts of stuff and then as soon as writing became my labor
7327.740000000001,7331.42, I mean people warn me that it would happen that I would be like I I got time off
7331.42,7334.3, I'm not gonna like you know work on this and it and it sadly it did
7335.1,7341.42, But I feel that now like I'm gonna have like no excuses not to wrap up this comic script that I've been working on
7341.820000000001,7346.620000000001, So hopefully people still remember me and I can try to get a few extra like hundred people to
7347.26,7349.900000000001, To pre-order the book if it ever gets published
7350.620000000001,7354.860000000001, Basically I know that every time that you guys was start talking about comics
7355.74,7360.86, My my taste and books are really similar to your Sean so every time you would be like a hate those dudes
7361.259999999999,7364.78, They always talk about how transmit your politics what they need to read and I'm like
7365.179999999999,7367.179999999999, Yeah
7367.179999999999,7373.099999999999, I do like I do like war now so I had to explain this to Anthony Warren the comic story the other day
7373.099999999999,7375.339999999999," Yeah, as I was actually given actually"
7375.66,7379.82, Before we went to the comic story or my house and I've been packing up so he's been inheriting a shit
7379.82,7386.78, Free stuff I'm gonna make a blog about that in Joe and I was telling them like that fell is good and some of war notes is other stuff like
7387.34,7391.099999999999, Plantary I was handed off to him. It was definitely worth reading you know if he's getting it for free and
7392.299999999999,7394.299999999999, Some of the stuff on the authority
7394.299999999999,7397.54, But that's cool to hear I mean thanks for yeah like for for all the
7397.98,7402.299999999999," Kind words you had for me. I feel yeah, I feel nice to hear that"
7405.5,7408.219999999999, And so what up what other comics are you reading out is
7409.9,7415.66, See I've been tempted to go back and read reread the watchman because of the hook because of the movie
7415.66,7420.219999999999, But the thing is that I never really got into the watchman because Alan more
7421.179999999999,7426.7, Ryan let me really pause for a minute. Ryan just went from nodding his head that doing like a whispering fuck yeah
7427.74,7430.86, To like shaking is making like a like a mouth like he just
7431.42,7434.0599999999995, Wasn't the car with the gallon his friends on the way to talk
7436.299999999999,7438.299999999999," So yeah, I'm going"
7438.299999999999,7439.0199999999995, Sorry
7439.02,7441.02, I know or is
7441.02,7443.9800000000005, I was I was gonna reread it but the thing is that I read it
7444.540000000001,7447.660000000001, I'd say about two years ago and it was the first time that I had read it
7448.700000000001,7453.34, Since when it first came out because I was a kid when it first came out and it totally blew me away
7453.34,7457.580000000001, I like the rap scene and then and I think I was like 12 and I was like oh my god
7458.38,7460.38, The comic book and
7460.38,7463.18, How did that affect you you know sexually
7463.9800000000005,7465.9800000000005, Actually
7466.38,7471.34, Like would you say it stay your taste at all or have you ever drawn
7472.3,7473.66, Super heroes
7473.66,7475.66, Engaged intercourse
7477.66,7479.66, Nobody should
7479.9800000000005,7483.9800000000005," There's plenty of that there's some websites for that yeah, I'm sure there are"
7484.54,7490.38, She sent out some there's John V. I did sent out the link did you see the photos where there was a group of guys apparently
7490.46,7497.18, They dressed up as as their favorite superheroes and they went to some like a band and building somewhere in the Midwest and
7497.66,7501.34, Engaged in sexual acts and some other kids that were in the area
7501.34,7502.22," Yeah, worked like"
7502.22,7508.06, Servedishly taking all these pictures of them and they then posted them so it's like venom blowing spider-man and then like
7508.54,7515.1," But out and like some industrial works, you know and with like Robin with Robin and like dark-winged nightwing whatever"
7515.42,7518.7," Yeah, nightwing standing by with like the arms cross like the"
7520.38,7522.38, It is real
7522.38,7527.66," Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think I put I put that up on my Twitter some time ago"
7528.06,7531.02," Yeah, every time I hear about people dressing up like super heroes"
7531.02,7537.74, I always remember the story that I heard like years ago where this couple were doing role playing in bed and
7538.86,7547.18, The girl or the the wife was handcuffed to the bed and that was when it dressed like Batman and he died of like a stroke or a heart attack
7547.740000000001,7551.1, That sounds like something worn out. That's what would right in one of his comics
7556.38,7558.38, That's pretty horrific
7558.700000000001,7564.38, That that I don't know man that needs like the snowpes treatment because that does sound exactly like something that would be in a
7565.820000000001,7567.820000000001, You know worn out a book like
7567.9800000000005,7569.9800000000005, Desolation Jones or something
7569.9800000000005,7575.900000000001, Like the whole point of that comic is like there's some infamous like porno with Hitler in it
7576.46,7582.299999999999," And it's about I don't even remember man, but it's not really what I prefer Hitler's porno legendary porno"
7583.0199999999995,7587.299999999999, Are you being serious? I'm dead serious. That's what desolation Jones is first story are to that sitting
7587.299999999999,7588.299999999999, Michelle
7588.299999999999,7591.339999999999, It sounds like a bookstore where I use to grow up like I'm from this
7591.74,7595.66, Town in Kentucky and there used to be this bookstore where everybody would go and get their Christmas cards and
7595.9,7600.139999999999, Comic books and magazines and there was this one lone section right in the very back wall
7600.46,7606.820000000001, Where they would have like the like the fan sick porn novels and it was right next to the magazines in the comic books
7606.820000000001,7613.900000000001," My limit are a stuff yeah, I'd like to sneak around to see what was going on and one day I opened up one of the books and it was like this not to"
7614.3,7616.3, Get it all with the ladies
7616.3,7623.740000000001, Did you ever buy did you ever buy a book from that section if you weren't embarrassed to take it to the counter would you have did you contemplate it?
7625.02,7627.02," No, I should have that would have been a good story"
7627.9800000000005,7634.22, Because I always see that sections in every comic book store and you always like wonder because it's not like when you walk into a porno store
7634.22,7637.820000000001, Where it's like as long as once you're in the door like it's all clear
7638.14,7642.540000000001, You know like you got to look both ways before you get in but in the comic store that section
7642.780000000001,7646.3, It's like when you're in there everyone else in the store turn over and like
7646.700000000001,7649.9400000000005, You might as well just like jacking off and in like a little K-mart
7649.9400000000005,7654.26, You know the bike porno books at the comic store. I see due regularly
7654.74,7661.9400000000005, Like you know I have a friend who went to comic store and there's there's regular customers that he had that they'll just bring stacks of that stuff up and like the the busts and
7662.34,7667.38, And all that like no shame way waiting in the bus like a bus to like like wonder woman or whatever
7667.38,7671.9800000000005, You know like made from like like flesh like type material no like
7673.9800000000005,7679.14, Oh like a sculptural bus right right I thought like you break like a like some kind of like polyurethal
7679.14,7686.6, Actually bus you know they you know my friend who I also talked about from high school Tony his dad
7686.6,7693.56, On the porno shop that I've referred to in San Diego and they also they sold it was basically the rump of a woman
7693.56,7695.5, But it was molded on a real
7695.900000000001,7697.1, Actress you know
7697.1,7702.400000000001, So it was like the whole thing but they had these and they were like 80 pounds or something and I don't know how much money
7702.400000000001,7703.900000000001, But it was like an entire
7704.42,7708.46, But I always imagine like so and just railing on that and like there
7709.099999999999,7714.759999999999, They're family coming in the door something but what we wanted to do is because he could get this shit for free
7715.82,7719.58, That was beyond the limit those were so expensive that he couldn't get that for free
7719.82,7724.04, But I wanted it because what I wanted to do was epoxy it on the hood of so much car
7724.78,7730.379999999999," Like a hood ornament so that like when they came out to go to work one morning. It's like boss hog, but like"
7730.900000000001,7736.02," You know, I don't know jetted James Center something on the front of his caddy"
7740.9400000000005,7745.5," Nice my phone is on the fritz all right, so what yeah, you got any other questions"
7745.5,7750.14," We still got we got 10 minutes before we get our next call. All right. Yeah, you know"
7750.14,7757.14, I was just thinking you know like I said you guys are really one very one of the very very few places
7757.660000000001,7760.46, That people can go to get really in depth
7761.62,7766.1, Like in depth analysis on a lot of the games out there and you know as much as you guys are super high
7766.1,7771.06, Brow you can also get super low brow and that's just a really cool mix and it's something that I always look forward to
7771.58,7773.820000000001, But now with the potential of
7775.5,7777.660000000001, The brodo no longer being the brodo
7778.780000000001,7780.9800000000005, Do you I want to know what you guys
7781.780000000001,7784.780000000001, idea is you think it's a demand for
7785.74,7790.0199999999995, The kind of entertainment you guys provide is going to increase and if that does
7790.7,7792.78, Where were we gonna get it if it's not the brodo you
7793.62,7800.74, You got I think I think I think basically it's inversely related to the stock price of financial institutions and
7800.74,7808.9, On Wall Street and and you're gonna see a very huge jump and the number of people who want to listen to people talk about games and
7808.9,7812.42, Also having sex with the fake rumps
7815.74,7820.58," I think that's that's real field here. Yeah, real feel I think that's gonna go just I mean"
7820.58,7826.98, It's gonna be on CNBC people are gonna be talking about it and I'm I'm up for providing that kind of in entertainment
7826.98,7833.74," You know and I think I could always call Sean, you know and and get him to just say you know"
7837.74,7842.5," Yeah, you have any of your voice males that you could play right now. I don't it'd probably be a bitch"
7845.54,7851.7," It would be cool if after Sean left there could still be some sort of podcast, but as of right now"
7851.7,7852.7, There's nothing
7852.7,7854.7, It's all just
7854.7,7861.46, I was with I was there will be there'll be something I mean this is this is going to be the last podcast that is branded
7861.46,7865.0199999999995, You have to be ready a bit right. You'll probably take a little bit of time off it
7865.5,7872.86, Something will fill the void. So Robert. Do you want to share like I mean or do you still want to like keep it to yourself in case you could
7873.38,7878.82, Actually find someone that will pay you to produce the kind of podcast that we had long wanted to make on the side
7879.339999999999,7886.0," Yeah, well, I mean I I don't feel bad about sharing anything and I would still love to do something like this"
7886.0,7891.38," Maybe here if I could get somebody receptive, but I mean like I was gonna say I thought it would be I think some more"
7891.38,7895.9, Or listeners would be interested knowing like what was but I didn't know like you're like yeah basically the idea
7895.9,7900.259999999999, I don't know if I don't know how many people heard the episode that Sean and I did
7900.780000000001,7905.860000000001, And Sean and I and Anthony did when when when Jeff was away on his European vacation
7906.02,7911.54," That had the merchants of cool segment that was yeah, yeah, yeah, it was like"
7915.54,7923.58, I've always really wanted to do like a super focused kind of podcast although I love the the the banter of
7923.58,7930.78, GFW radio and lately I've been thinking like I'd like to do something that balanced this kind of like freeform talk with very
7931.46,7936.58, Like written and edited pieces that go like thematically in an episode
7936.58,7938.86," Maybe not every episode with a theme, but you know"
7938.86,7948.1, I've got some themes that I think would be fun to the theme. I idea that we started with I think was had so much potential and it was already kind of a mix between
7948.74,7953.34, off the cough stuff and then prepared material and like the when we say theme like let's take
7953.34,7957.06, Take example of storytelling. This is one that we thought was gonna be our first tester
7957.06,7962.1," Yeah, and it's deliberately generic enough so that it can encompass like a great deal of variety"
7962.1,7969.3," So for example, we Robert you interviewed air guapo and in the context of storytelling stories in single player games"
7969.3,7976.02, And then escol who was talking about multiplayer games in the notion that you know like anecdotes and the way that
7976.02,7977.78, The people who play multiplayer games
7977.78,7985.139999999999," The guys tell stories who's making the the game called love. Yeah, he was sort of talking about how people sort of tell their own stories"
7985.139999999999,7989.3, He's a multiplayer games and then I had a bunch of like other sort of small stuff to go with it
7989.3,7994.42, I had had this like short story that I'd written and I told you guys about once about the the
7995.179999999999,8001.38, The the guy who's ultimate dream in life was to tell the story of his Vietnam service through a
8001.82,8003.82, Through a miniature golf course
8004.78,8008.82, Which is kind of a good metaphor for a lot of games that would attempt to tell stories
8008.82,8014.86," Yeah, yeah, and it was just this kind of joke about you know the strange ambition that that anyone who's into games has"
8014.94,8019.74, To have like an ultimately fulfilling story told through the mechanism of playing a game
8019.74,8021.74, Which is hilariously awkward and weird
8022.54,8028.5, But then we had like we wanted to have like other buffer almost out like we used warrior wars an example
8028.82,8032.5599999999995, Like a warrior wear like quality where you're not certain what's gonna come next even though
8032.56,8038.22, It's gonna be on the theme so one thing we really really wanted to do I told Ken Levine this neapologist for not getting back to me
8038.22,8041.46, I guess he just missed the email is we wanted to take
8042.88,8052.1, snippets from fan fiction from novelization to video games and then actual lines from from video games that may or may not be good or embarrassing
8052.1,8057.46, And read one of those to him by turns and have my identify what what the source was
8057.46,8059.46, Of this three options
8059.46,8065.26, So it would be just like boom say you go from from you know a discussion a thoughtful discussion about narrative or something
8065.26,8069.26, Then it's like you hear you hear this absurd line and then you hear that and then boom that might come back later
8069.86,8074.34, To put on the street. There's just so much. I think that is there's so much that can be done in this space
8074.58,8076.58, But right now
8076.58,8079.46," It's I mean, I think the stuff that's out there is great so like again"
8079.46,8083.5," I don't want to don't take this is like yeah, I think people can do better things"
8083.5,8085.86, It's I think people can do a wider range of things
8085.86,8092.34, So that's just adding to what's out there and and what you get there though is it requires production a lot of labor
8092.34,8101.5, Like on Robert's part merchants cool took a lot of work and that amount of time investment takes either someone that's willing to pay you salary or to compensate you with the freelance thing and right now
8101.5,8108.6, I think with most sites the ideas like if we have x amount of dollars to spend we're still gonna we know we'll get
8108.6,8114.72, We'll get a specified amount of returns or or clicks if you will if we do that preview
8115.200000000001,8122.360000000001, The hands-on preview of Barney Rebels bedrock racing. Where is it if you try to do this story it might be cool or something or
8123.280000000001,8124.280000000001, You know
8124.280000000001,8128.200000000001," Yes, you run into stuff you run into issues some some people might say you know"
8128.200000000001,8133.52, That's too beard stroking or like we don't know that people want that or that's not worth the time
8133.8,8138.360000000001, The one thing that I would say is that I started to notice with GFW is just that if you make
8138.36,8145.44, Something cool that you get a lot of people listening to it that are in the business people that you might want to talk to people that could create
8145.44,8149.5599999999995, The kind of news interest that you need to to have something
8150.28,8155.28, You know that people want to listen to and and I think that that's has potential
8155.28,8161.12, You know if you can if you can put out something cool and and get people that you normally wouldn't be able to interview
8161.639999999999,8166.16, Interested in interviewing and participating and playing playing along in these various ideas
8166.16,8171.92," Not always interviews of course. Yeah, I like we're pitching this and it's kind of funny. Oh, audience"
8172.24,8178.32," Let yeah, hey, yes, we will make it for you my PayPal account. You could say now I could say yeah, yeah"
8178.88,8181.5199999999995, At any time it would have been happy they've done this for someone
8183.44,8188.48," Yeah, but you know maybe maybe that'll happen. So yeah, yeah, it's funny too"
8188.48,8194.74, As you were saying this I was thinking who's got the ability to do this people kind of like like you know like rock on your case
8194.74,8200.66," You guys put together the squatter in a shame, right? Yeah, I mean so it's like you guys would definitely"
8200.66,8205.38, It's like you you'd have the time to do whatever you want if it takes you two weeks to put together an episode
8205.38,8208.74," You guys have a time, but you don't have the contacts and you know on all these other things"
8208.74,8214.82, But I wonder if it's like if it'll be places like one up where these kind of things start to come from or if it'll be
8216.1,8221.38," You know from you know like like like guys like like rock on yeah, or even guys like"
8221.859999999999,8228.099999999999, I don't know it could even guys like Anthony and Ryan while I'm just saying it have to be on our own time because it'd be a peer labor of love unpaid
8228.099999999999,8231.3," That's the thing at this yeah, so yeah, yeah, well, you know"
8231.3,8233.859999999999, I met and that's easy for us to do because you know
8234.42,8236.98, I saw it from from Bay she does some pretty much work for you guys
8237.779999999999,8240.339999999998," Well, you know, none of us are in the video gaming"
8241.22,8246.98," Media you know, so we don't have to do this in a unified basis what you guys do so it's it's totally"
8247.46,8251.14, It's a fine hobby for us and we love doing it in every town we do an episode
8251.14,8257.3," It's exciting you know, so I can definitely see the play that's cool that you do that like we were getting ready to get another call"
8257.3,8264.1, But I want to like keep keep doing that. I mean it's got to be hard at first when you know like you don't have a bajillion people listening
8264.66,8271.22, And like there could be a week like we're if you ever like should we keep doing this is it worth it like just keep doing it like look at the guys that if um the two
8272.179999999998,8276.34," The player one podcast, you know, I mean granted they they worked at EGM. They've got you know"
8276.34,8281.06, Recognizable names and you know long reach perspectives about the industry
8281.06,8287.14, But they without any promotion or anything they just keep doing and keep doing it and it's like we're gets out there same thing for like you know
8287.14,8290.58, The gamers with jobs guys are recommending checking out their their podcasts and sight
8290.58,8294.98," And I mean it's cool to see people just like just keep doing it stick with it, you know"
8294.98,8296.98, You never know what'll come of it
8297.939999999999,8301.619999999999, So thanks for calling men. We're gonna we're gonna move on to the next caller appreciate it
8302.42,8305.46, Thanks have a good one. Good luck. Thanks. Thanks. Yeah
8305.859999999999,8311.06," You know, I was gonna say like I know so just thinking and internet age like having an idea is just bullshit"
8311.38,8314.74," It's doing it, you know, everyone's got a million fucking idea"
8314.74,8319.06," Which is why it was glad we did the merchants a cool thing. Yeah, we just did great. That was that's what I did all year"
8319.46,8324.74," We had to be like let's just go on the street and do this shit. Yeah, and I felt I was happy that we did it"
8325.699999999999,8332.18, Best thing all year we got we got another caller right on the dot. This should be uh this is running like clockwork up gallons

8412.42,8417.86, I mean it's not you know we have to put the podcast up but I doubt we'll have it until well actually maybe it works out
8417.94,8421.380000000001, Maybe I can't guarantee anything but there's a possibility
8422.18,8426.74, That might be able to listen to this on your way to work if not we apologize and it'll be available tomorrow

8436.02,8441.7, for the units is just meeting you guys for the last show I've been listening now for that well how long you've been going
8441.7,8449.220000000001," over two years now. Yeah, since the podcast died and kind of it's just been something"
8449.220000000001,8454.34, like she's just been a great listen well for all of us guys I guess you'll go for you can
8454.34,8458.42, tell by them below that you get from the thread every week but I'm
8459.380000000001,8462.34, not just great to be able to get through and speak you guys I mean
8463.380000000001,8468.820000000002, it's been one of the podcasts where I kind of even when I was away I was a volunteer in Africa for a while
8469.779999999999,8474.26, were you the one in the summer were you at Sierra Leone in that place was shot like
8474.26,8480.1, shot like in the nest and kind of sit there for about an hour to get your podcast and then
8480.1,8483.86, take a toll on my high-podden listen when I had nothing to do starting the
8483.86,8490.18, office in the electricity so it's been good man it's gonna be weird Sean you dropped a bomb today yeah
8491.38,8496.66, where you were I did I have announced that on here so you don't
8496.66,8501.22, know he's making the new fighter man you don't know I didn't realize that that the
8501.22,8507.86, the people that are having calling in don't know shit he's making the new spider okay so
8507.86,8515.7, yeah I'm going to join a 2k Boston and it's the team that made Bioshok and it's their next project
8515.7,8520.34, I can't say what it is it's other than it's just gonna surprise people and that there's a whole lot
8520.34,8528.66, about it that's like just hopefully pretty pretty bold and new but um project is in the green
8528.66,8535.460000000001, on this one oh yeah he is so yeah he's he's in my new boss okay that's I looked out going from
8535.460000000001,8541.460000000001, Jeff Green to Ken Levine is a pretty good couple of what's he Joe title is it gonna be
8541.460000000001,8548.02, I'm a social he makes the coffee I'm a social producer on the project and it's kind of hard to
8548.02,8554.5, say exactly what do these that in tail because that title kind of I mean it depends on which
8554.5,8559.54, studio you're with might mean different things but basically for me it's this perfect you know
8559.54,8565.62, ideal situation in that I'm going to get to like do a bit of everything it seems and really like
8565.62,8571.140000000001, understand I mean really learn about how a game is producing the first place I've got my eye on
8571.140000000001,8576.5, design and I mean if everything goes well I know I should have plenty of opportunities they're provided
8577.46,8582.98, you know I I'm good at what I'm trying to do I'm to move on to the designer whatever else
8584.02,8588.5, we're talking a lot to you gonna start what what do you think about kind of you're gonna have
8588.5,8593.3, a little project on that to work on and present everyone is gonna be I don't know if it's gonna
8593.3,8599.06, be a challenge you're gonna be shitting bricks when it's by the time it's done oh um I don't just
8599.06,8603.46, run you you don't know what I expected and just go apart right it's really like one day at a time
8603.46,8608.019999999999, right now I mean like I've spent this past week packing and then I'm sweating like because I'm moving
8608.019999999999,8613.859999999999, from you know one coast from you know from California to Massachusetts so planning trying to find
8613.859999999999,8619.14, a new place and especially like with the site on seeing issue where I might not even actually
8619.14,8624.82, be able to go and physically tour where I'm committing to moving into and that's never advisable
8624.82,8629.3, so all that's been on my mind and it's kind of like just taking it you know one phase of time
8629.3,8633.46, and then so it's like as soon as I'm over that like as soon as I have a new place then I
8633.46,8639.22, worry about the moving truck and and that then I get the door and then like I just hopefully
8639.22,8643.619999999999, all that other shit's priming I just focus on you know whatever comes bit but I really can't wait to
8643.619999999999,8650.42, continue just even before I my official start day just you know learning even more about you know
8650.42,8656.9, the nuances and the details of the project and okay so the most important thing most of
8656.9,8661.779999999999, all in question everyone's like what's going to happen to the Twitter feed oh that's definitely
8661.779999999999,8666.74, gonna continue I hope people check it out I mean this has been the great thing working it it's
8666.74,8671.94, if two you know it means it like no one would be paying attention to my Twitter if it weren't for
8671.94,8676.34, it would work for the fact that I work here you know if anyone's paying attention to you Twitter
8676.34,8685.06, do you have any of these kind of every time I've got this Twitter fox application on my
8685.06,8690.98, file and every time something pulled up if it's Sean Elliott attached to it then all you just
8690.98,8703.38, instantly need to press on that because you see did you see did you see Krunk Panda slash
8703.539999999999,8713.06, woody dodging uh dot jpeg no no no no no no jpeg I don't even want to break it down man this was the
8713.859999999999,8718.5, the people of some ways we don't even let's not even get into it that's just between you and
8718.5,8722.339999999998, me man if you go on there and you search for the thing that says do not get this error not safe
8722.339999999998,8726.82, or work you don't safe for them I don't know it's some American school guide or something
8726.82,8731.14, to why you should take your church and because you can have about what they've begun with a
8731.14,8737.86, funny thing yeah that was that was like pretty old I got uh rory sort of like
8737.86,8742.5, yelled at me for that being old but I just like so and sent that to me today and I thought that was
8742.5,8747.539999999999, funny like that seems like it could be a good punch line where you're at how many of them make
8747.539999999999,8751.619999999999, shotgun how many people are subscribed you're Twitter now because I remember you were talking
8751.62,8758.02," about having the party for like 1,000 I'm not over like 1500 now so I'm assuming more people"
8758.02,8762.900000000001, check it out because I know like for me for example if I think who's my test is I would visit my
8762.900000000001,8768.18, Twitter feed if I wasn't me just because like I try to keep like good content on there but I wouldn't
8768.18,8773.78, subscribe to it because I wouldn't want like interrupting me like I don't know I don't want to email
8773.78,8778.820000000002, every time I got a minute I see you I look here to which I get I look here Twitter but I only do it
8778.82,8784.02, like when I'm eating lunch which sometimes does not advisable but when I'm like looking around for like
8784.02,8788.82, video content or something that I can watch while I'm eating which is a bad habit of mine
8789.539999999999,8794.9, then I will go to your page which I will say Google like auto completes Sean Elliott Twitter
8794.9,8801.86, which I think is pretty impressive weird like it's one of the things that pops up so cool yeah
8801.86,8806.5, like thanks for checking out more people that's like kind of vanity project the more followers I got
8807.46,8813.54, the bigger my eatinger is man how would you help me swell that eating you
8813.54,8818.74, I'm just a good chill and that's good to know it's gonna be gonna be still going and but
8818.74,8824.98, everything else you you are kind of going back what's gonna happen with kind of a sports
8824.98,8829.46, gonna have a lot of work to do anyway yeah yeah yeah yeah well and that's that's part of the
8829.46,8834.58, reality obviously I'm not gonna have a weekly podcast but I will say this that they
8834.9,8839.78, 2K they they say that they're appreciative of the skill set that I have on me now
8840.5,8844.66, and they made it clear that they want to use whatever talents they think I have
8845.38,8849.78, in every like practical way they can so what that means you're gonna have to wait and see
8850.5,8855.539999999999, but uh because I mean we're all sort of figuring it out but I mean like yeah I'm not gonna disappear
8855.539999999999,8859.78, from the face there if I'm still gonna be posting on like you know gaming age and one up and stuff
8859.78,8863.78, I'm just not gonna be it's just gonna be about how the game you're working on so awesome
8864.74,8868.18, yeah I didn't if you say a bad thing about like one of our properties I'll jump down
8868.18,8870.900000000001, you're throat now I won't be able to do that that'll be awkward
8870.900000000001,8876.74, you oh well the other guys know that what's gonna happen to Anthony you're right and
8877.300000000001,8883.060000000001, well what are we gonna are you gonna see them we in another podcast or we're gonna see them kind
8883.060000000001,8887.62, I'm basically looking for a job I played 7-11 earlier today
8888.42,8891.86, well yeah I was gonna say I don't know if you ever listened to one up FM but
8892.58,8897.62, I do uh I do a briefly the every thing on every one up FM the same thing by the way
8897.62,8901.94, I do everything yeah exactly see I mean it's never in the show no it's
8901.94,8907.380000000001, or anything but I'm on there every week so I'll probably be making more more time on one up FM
8907.380000000001,8913.060000000001, and then uh beyond that any future one up podcast that might come out of it to be determined
8913.060000000001,8918.82, if ever so there'll be something you know I've always I've always been impressed with the
8918.9,8924.9, number of international listeners the JFW radio especially given like the peculiar humor of it
8924.9,8929.94, and I wonder if there's ever anything in the show that you heard us like joking about that just
8929.94,8937.86, didn't translate culturally well let's just kind of um I don't know there was something on my last
8937.86,8943.22, one whether it's kind of if something just doesn't exist here then I'm and it's sometimes what
8943.3,8949.3, we it both the UK and bring whichever we are the American media is kind of you know it's one of
8949.3,8955.06, those things but but get out of that with PB from so we can bring in pretty much follow over then
8955.06,8961.46, and it's one of the things I think the the kind of the culture and the kind of attitude that you
8961.46,8967.14, have on GFW radio so I'm really trying to say so I think that's why it's been so successful I mean
8967.22,8974.18, I think everyone has a humor and it strange I mean the one of podcast follows been
8974.18,8980.66, to me as well kind of you know the the more personal set of podcasts where you can read me
8981.46,8986.98, and not to well not to issue our system which but kind of something where you can get an all
8986.98,8992.099999999999, personal in how they feel about particularly again and I assume you guys know that like you
8992.1,8998.58, spend where people can kind of everyone feel the touch to kind of or understand where everyone's
8998.58,9005.220000000001, coming from right yeah it really I think the podcast really make up for kind of stuff that
9005.220000000001,9012.34, it hasn't been covered on in kind of you know in on print or in and on the web things like talking
9012.34,9017.380000000001, about playing games but you know everyone's playing at the moment instead of just what's always new
9018.339999999998,9023.699999999999, kind of fresh which seems tough and in the print stuff you can kind of hear about you know your
9023.699999999999,9032.74, experiences playing m and you know all the team forest where those games have been out for a while
9032.74,9037.779999999999, and most people aren't really all that about cover and them but there's a lot of people in the
9037.779999999999,9044.66, big online bit of stuff that was like to hear about that is invested in those games I think that's
9044.66,9049.46, awesome to hear because I mean a lot of times I mean what we're talking about is like people acting
9049.46,9054.42, as filters so you know when we're on on the casual sense as opposed to like a review or something
9054.42,9058.42, just like when you have a body that tells you what's cool and what's not and so maybe you don't
9058.42,9064.66, have all the time in the world to be up on a certain type of music or or whatever and like maybe
9064.66,9069.38, your specialty something else like books or movies or something and you tend to like cover those
9070.339999999998,9075.699999999999, blind spots with different friends but part of that's the personality and knowing I mean this was
9075.699999999999,9079.699999999999, something that they sort of like promoted in egm and print for the longest time is that the
9079.699999999999,9084.339999999998, reason you have multiple viewers and the reason that specifically that it works is not that it's just
9084.339999999998,9088.74, different perspectives but it works in that short space because you feel like as though you're
9088.74,9092.82, familiar with the people and you know them but I think that just is carried over it's translated
9092.82,9097.3, even more naturally in where you can hear our voices and every week you could say like I mean you
9097.3,9100.5, know there's like antagonists and pro tagants like that's John again he needs to shut the
9100.5,9105.38, fuck up or like yeah he didn't be right the last time like I'm gonna pay extra special attention
9105.38,9110.58, when he's talking about this game because so far he's batting like whatever the record is and like
9110.58,9114.9, I mean I'm glad to hear that that's kind of worked out the way that I assumed it would
9114.9,9121.06, I hope it would yeah you know that's something definitely and it's kind of I just think it's
9121.06,9125.939999999999, it just adds so much more from kind of just the general and print all we would get was it would
9125.94,9131.460000000001, probably be a preview of a few and then maybe some news if some of these chains by a DLC
9131.460000000001,9137.300000000001, or whatever you don't really get to grind down into the opinions of everyone who's been playing
9137.300000000001,9142.34, especially if it's kind of you know those big games that are really sticky for people that will
9142.34,9147.140000000001, stick and people will play them for a long time and kind of spying every game that's out
9147.140000000001,9151.060000000001, and how like you're perspective evolves on it too because I mean even that happens a lot of
9151.06,9156.74, time in print like Jay uh he's known Jay uh Chu used to work here and he's known as for the
9156.74,9162.18, Chae flop and that was basically he would get a game in and he'd be reviewing it and you talk
9162.18,9165.46, to him and he'd either love it or hate it but then the next week you talk to him and he's like
9165.46,9169.38, the exact polar opposite point of view that was known as a Chae flop but that's like a very
9169.859999999999,9176.18, natural and and fine a legitimate aspect of you know experiencing a game and you would never
9176.18,9180.1, get that because what would happen is that the print story would erase the Chae flop and you
9180.18,9186.02, just get like wherever he he just mounted you know but like kind of podcast you get to see the flop
9186.74,9191.140000000001, and I'm not making fun of it is the terms funny and he was used as a joke here but I mean I
9191.140000000001,9194.98, have I think that's cool I mean especially when you're able to have like a dramatically different
9194.98,9201.94, take on a game over the course of playing it we're about to get another call here so
9203.54,9208.02, yeah I know like yeah thanks a lot and thanks for staying up and appreciate it and thanks for all the
9208.1,9213.86, time it was a trip to be able to speak you guys have listened for a while all the best
9213.86,9220.34, shown with kind of you future stuff and the rest of you guys and really forward to the least here
9220.34,9225.54, in the previous some form whether it's kind of post on Garthor and underneath it's kind of
9225.54,9231.140000000001, you want the one of the hem segments so yeah and great to be in chief of the folks
9231.14,9236.18, you're doing that and the podcast you're too man thanks a lot good night bye
9237.619999999999,9242.5, okay now we we rush them on the phone the phone should be ringing I feel like
9242.5,9247.699999999999, everybody in our building needs to listen to this podcast what because I feel like it's it's
9247.699999999999,9252.34, justification for everything the skip does to let everyone know the podcasts are super important
9252.34,9258.5, to everyone to our users yeah I think they are too I mean when there's like a if there's ever
9258.5,9263.78, I mean what kind of talking about what your what what the implication is there is that maybe not
9263.78,9268.58, everyone in the building agrees that they're important that maybe there are other ways that are
9268.58,9273.06, more effective to to bring in traffic and stuff but the thing of the podcasts is that when you
9273.7,9278.74, you don't just have someone that that sees it or reads it and pays attention you have someone like
9278.74,9282.5, the people that have been calling us that are like really paying attention and they got to
9282.5,9287.62, make the shirt that Roberts wearing and what happens is that if those people just start off listening
9287.62,9292.42, to it then I think it encourages them to go and check out I mean who's to say that they're
9292.42,9296.34, separate right if this story and the site gets X number of clicks how do you know that like
9296.34,9300.34, half of those clicks aren't from people that are even paying attention in the first place because we
9300.34,9306.26, we differentiate ourselves or interest succeeded in interesting people because you know we had
9306.26,9310.02, something to say and they for whatever reason they're jealous of us for sure I mean I'm I'm positive
9310.02,9314.58, that you being on the podcast and having people get to know you as much as they can through
9314.58,9318.5, an audio podcast is like definitely like when they see an article and they're like oh shit
9318.5,9322.18, Sean wrote this they're like way more interested in what you have to say because you definitely
9322.18,9326.18, get to know you have to like now I know the way Sean thinks I want to see what he has to say
9326.18,9331.3, about this game the context for and stuff yeah I think that they're they're they're super important
9331.3,9338.1, for that I mean because like look if you take that away I mean it's I'm not saying that that
9338.1,9342.82, everything on the site it isn't standing out or anything but I mean I think it it helps people
9342.82,9346.5, it gives people sort of the resettist don't to understand what the differences that are there
9346.5,9350.58, otherwise I mean really you're like yeah there's like yeah there's games bothers what up and
9350.58,9355.14, there's just this big and it gives some continuity that what you're talking about you know the old
9355.14,9360.74, EGM formula of like trying to trying to give people a flavor of the personality of the person
9360.74,9365.779999999999, talking about games or writing about games right you're not just some faceless nerd you're
9365.779999999999,9370.26, somebody that people know and I mean I know a lot of people want to you know readers and stuff
9370.26,9375.78, right now I feel like a lot of the familiar faces are gone but you know the new people will be
9375.78,9380.98, familiar soon enough and and hopefully that sort of the same thing will be cultivated again and
9380.98,9387.22, it won't become you know generic and like everything else on the web right yeah and like I
9387.22,9391.78, agree with everything you said there and then just like and on top of it the podcast do get good
9391.78,9397.380000000001, traffic yeah they get a lot of downloads and then and then even that you've got this other problem
9397.38,9402.179999999998, where the the problem that comics running to this is we exemplify this today Anthony we want
9402.179999999998,9406.42, to pick up walking dead there's like guys in the store reading books that aren't going to take
9406.42,9410.019999999999, them home and buy them and then he buys one but I didn't because as soon as he was done he
9410.019999999999,9413.779999999999, gives it to me to read it and stuff so there's that's called pass alone I'm sure there's
9413.779999999999,9418.98, pass along for podcasts there's people who re-host the equivalent of they re-host them to a faster
9418.98,9424.099999999999, provider or something like a z share or maybe upload there it split between people that pull them off
9424.1,9428.82, of iTunes and people that get them that use the the pod track link and all these different things but
9428.82,9435.220000000001, like even like not even counting for any of that shit like there's still like there's so many
9435.220000000001,9440.18, people that listen seems kind of sad to use like the last minutes of the brodeo to promote
9440.18,9445.220000000001, how the brodeo was like a worthwhile project yeah that's it it was a waste of our guy damn
9445.220000000001,9453.220000000001, time it was dog we're just sitting here in the in the Colin Center waiting for the next pledge
9453.859999999999,9457.539999999999, it's true the I mean every week Ryan would get pissed that we'd have to come down here and do this
9458.26,9463.46, he'd be like looking forward to when he could slave drive me back to work next so I mean this was
9463.46,9467.619999999999, going to give him more time to just sit there and fucking make me grind through whatever shitty
9467.619999999999,9471.699999999999, game he has planned for me next right now you're playing it's yet another one of these
9471.699999999999,9477.779999999999, fucking dynasty warrior's games I hate those games I told I told every two weeks they're on your
9477.779999999999,9482.66, TV and it's supposed to be a different one and he has been tragically tight past those the guy who
9482.66,9487.539999999999, refused to thank you and don't do that to him shamed it that to me at EGM that's my experience
9487.539999999999,9492.42, with him so I did three of those games I did two the dynasty warriors I even forget which ones because
9492.42,9497.619999999999, they don't even it's not even like three and four there's like all these like Samarishers well I did
9497.619999999999,9503.06, to see Samarish too but there's all these like bullshit like three extreme or something and it doesn't matter
9503.06,9507.3, years can go by it's like the fucking rib van winkle of the game it's like every time you come by it's
9507.3,9512.18, like the same shit it's just like the the guy's got a different name over his floating over his head
9512.26,9518.1, the drip lane and it's like if you put if you press a a a b the b part of the attack is different
9518.1,9522.82, then if you played the other guy with a name you can't know so there's a genre of you with this game
9523.220000000001,9529.220000000001, I was just hated because I had to review at least for maybe five or six if you count like the
9529.220000000001,9534.98, what what what are those called at the end of the book in EGM the oh the wrap ups wrap ups yeah
9534.98,9540.02, because I got I got typecast back in the day of the days as a dynasty warriors person
9540.66,9545.62, yeah I was that yeah I did lots of those so you know it's a phase we all did you hate
9545.62,9553.300000000001, do you hate your heaps and you stuck with women and did you ever write about dicey wars
9553.300000000001,9560.34, and have a line or something that acknowledged like the popularity the the just what is the
9560.34,9566.02, warm looking for the incomprehensible popularity and longevity of you you're gonna write about it's like
9566.1,9571.86, the learning idea to observe it's like well there's a bunch of selling these I don't know what to say
9571.86,9576.74, about it because it's the same fucking game I don't you know I don't know who's buying this but here you go
9576.74,9580.74, I guess we should just like copy and paste their review from every previous game and just put that on
9580.74,9586.82, the awesome just change the byline change the whole thing this like maybe someone out there could do this
9586.82,9592.74, compile uh separate reviews from different games in the series you know and then put them all
9592.74,9596.34, together and look for patterns see how different the reviews are maybe their views are just the
9596.34,9600.82, fucking games you know where you're like maybe you can even catch someone use the same goddamn intro like
9600.82,9605.38, three years later something you know like or he just like alternates so you can't catch and you find
9605.38,9612.1, you find the one off to find the one guy who's just like the the poetic wars of the feudal
9612.1,9619.3, era of Japanese history or upon us again or like or something about X and Y and Z you never just never
9619.3,9623.22, gets older you know something like that about yeah because that's a lot of people defend that game
9623.22,9628.099999999999, it's just just fun just be all this guys it's like I didn't enjoy the PSP one because I was a portable
9628.099999999999,9632.259999999998, thing was that your first one I reviewed that you would enjoy it because it was your first time you've
9632.259999999998,9637.38, experienced that I reviewed the PSP game I enjoyed you know the PSP one wasn't so bad for me like
9637.38,9641.14, just because playing it portable didn't really bother me like it's a way to kill time on the
9641.14,9645.539999999999, train but sitting in front of my TV like that for a long-hands period of time doing that I don't know
9645.54,9648.820000000002, I can handle that shit but that doesn't make sense at the same time because I love the
9648.820000000002,9653.060000000001, Baldur's Gate Games for like PS2 and Xbox and those are just fucking button matching until
9653.060000000001,9659.060000000001, you're eyes bleed as well so yeah actually I think it is it is the loot or that and you just
9659.060000000001,9665.060000000001, love that like deep fantasy stuff in your racist against Asians there's that too I'm just joking
9665.060000000001,9670.660000000002, Anthony's looking shocked that was a joke just like the story about catching you jacking off in
9671.3,9672.66, ventral
9674.9,9681.619999999999, it's a mix of bullshit and reality like Miguel swears that his story was real I bet you it is real
9681.619999999999,9686.26, he also has another story actually I would say it's a thing they didn't have nothing to say before
9686.26,9692.9, he has another story about finding a human head in a paper bag is a child in Florida well as
9692.9,9696.58, mom they were you know they weren't all that well often mom taught them to like look for
9696.58,9699.7, stuff on the ground that might be worthwhile like if anyone dropped a wallet or a person or
9699.7,9704.820000000002, something you know or like you know bags and stuff and like he says that after that he was
9704.820000000002,9709.060000000001, used to doing that one time he saw a bag ran for grabbed it that there was a head in there
9710.26,9717.300000000001, either his mom he was like token at a really early age a tender age or that's the truth but
9717.300000000001,9722.980000000001, we'll never know because he's not he's not he's not explained himself well that you know I'd like
9722.980000000001,9727.220000000001, to take actually because you just said the word tender it's like it can be really yeah have
9727.22,9731.06, you notice like man I just speaking about how much people listen to the show kickass all the
9731.06,9735.859999999999, fucking youtube videos everyone's made they rock they rock so hard like the time you seen the
9735.859999999999,9740.74, tender under like fake movie introduction match up with an anime yeah exactly actually like
9740.74,9746.5, back that someone's like taking time to like make something that like has to do with you
9747.14,9751.46, that's like now you know how girls you know when when they love it when if you make a Macard or
9751.46,9756.26, something maybe like I don't care like what you get me from birthday but if you did just like it
9756.34,9761.54, it would have been more important you spent so much time gluing these macaroni yeah to this construction paper
9761.54,9766.98, now I can relate to that yeah they're sent us these like beautiful handmade cards
9768.42,9773.22, in the form of like youtube's and photoshopps of via paintings and milking y'all don't know
9773.22,9777.460000000001, what I was just about to give up at another caller final my bladders about to explode to
9777.539999999999,9784.179999999998, you'll be so bad oh she'll just called he was here and he talked about this is live
9785.859999999999,9792.339999999998, where I like how we quiet down and he answers the phone I know what was it a wrong number oh
9793.38,9797.939999999999, who's this hello guys yeah what's up you've reached the brodio
9798.66,9804.66, this is a amino man 65 from the board yeah
9806.5,9810.58, something wait that's not the guy written down though who's the guy well the guy written down
9810.58,9815.460000000001, fucking my self that way yeah we doesn't matter dude we got a amino man on the line
9815.460000000001,9821.220000000001, and it's a timing is right you can you can amino man is his name if you lived in the matrix
9821.220000000001,9826.1, that's like just like can you imagine like if more fiasite to come up to me and be like
9826.1,9830.74, I've been looking for you for a long time Jeff money
9834.18,9838.1, anyways so hey how's it going I just realized I have to feel listener I mean the people that are
9838.1,9844.02, calling it on what's up you can ask us any question you want but the the details for me is that
9844.02,9852.58, I'm joining the team that made bioshock and Boston okay disappointed a lot of people were
9852.58,9857.3, thinking it was going to be valver relic yeah i heard valver lot that was going to be around
9857.3,9861.38, which is funny i'm really happy i could be happier to go where i'm going and it's also like
9862.66,9866.5, it's also cool because i don't have to feel like a shield because no one's like oh he was a
9866.5,9870.26, fucking shield for that game it only makes sense it's like that no one guessed it not a single
9870.26,9874.18, person guess so i feel like i have a clean conscience yeah but now everyone is going to get back to
9874.18,9878.26, all the pocket and they don't find it out by a shit and i bring it up a lot but there's a reason
9878.26,9881.94, for that and the same way i bring up half life laws like i mean i think their game to do certain
9881.94,9886.58, things well one the reason and they're like a point of reference for everyone because most people
9886.58,9890.74, have played them you know but um but yeah i mean there are my favorite games i mean there's no
9890.74,9894.58, just like there's no bullshit about it could have been a lot worse if it was valver people would
9894.58,9898.34, went back to like everyone up show when you were wearing like your your heavy team for just
9898.34,9903.060000000001, two certain just like screencapped that and put it on like the gap there's something there is that
9903.060000000001,9909.62, like fanboy level like imagine i mean i'm surprised no one's asked me because it is um it's so
9909.7,9916.660000000002, different between going from the media to actually making the game and you just kind of expected
9916.660000000002,9919.460000000001, a lot of people to ask me about the differences between that because they are definitely different
9919.460000000001,9924.34, careers but then i mean one thing i was going to say is that imagine say you were writing for
9924.34,9932.1, since this is enthusiast press this is more like this isn't um like a really literary cinema journal
9932.1,9937.140000000001, or something it would be more like not quite fangory but whatever but say like you work for like
9937.14,9942.34, just like an enthusiast movie thing and the like to me it can pick it in like spielberg or someone
9942.34,9948.18, that you really admired you know um it was like hey do you want to like come learn how to make a movie with me
9948.82,9953.859999999999, you like fucking hell yeah i do and then he'll give him a hand to that cross a rainbow
9954.66,9962.019999999999, like in heaven sorry for talking over you man like let's put it back to you um you know man
9962.18,9969.060000000001, all right you have to call me that is that making awkward what's what do you want to be called
9969.060000000001,9976.02, him what what is your real name you did your mom tell you not to tell us radio
9978.02,9984.98, my real name yeah okay that's easy enough we we know a Jeff how long you get listen to the
9985.3,9992.74, show for what the man talks are you asking the equivalent of like the grandma did you like
9992.74,9998.66, did you have a good Christmas what did you get remember remember asking what you get for Christmas last year
9999.3,10008.42, so let's stop in a rough time we're sorry Jeff go ahead okay um i guess i was just kind of wondering
10008.42,10016.18, like what i mean what got you guys into the uh as a game in the street in the sense like
10016.18,10023.94, was it your interest in games or um just writing or both right neither um just kind of like
10023.94,10030.1, what sparked your interest in the industry to begin with i would mind starting that off i actually
10030.1,10036.98, from a very early age bought video game magazines like starting in like i don't know second or third
10037.06,10043.3, grade i used to always buy video games and computer entertainment magazine it was before eGM was a
10043.939999999999,10050.1, was a new stand thing it might have been a zine at that point but uh but i i always read video
10050.1,10054.74, game magazines i bought like you know all all the ones that would come out and i could buy
10054.74,10059.38, my local safeway and that was where i mostly read about games because i didn't like like we were
10059.38,10064.42, talking about earlier it wasn't it was before renting and stuff so that was where i mainly got my
10064.42,10068.26, game fix i was like playing a couple of games but reading about tons of things and i was
10068.26,10073.78, wanted to write for video game magazine it's kind of a weird thing to grow up and actually do that but
10073.78,10082.58, even in college i was sort of aiming at that um uh you know in what i was doing and i guess that's
10082.58,10091.54, that's why i'm here true ride sort of like that for me except minus the college yeah you
10091.54,10096.26, weren't such a loser no you got beat up in college that's what you're saying last week hey i
10097.220000000001,10103.300000000001, know my time table was a little off okay Ryan you came straight from high school into an
10103.300000000001,10111.140000000001, internship at cgw that is that is not true no i was i was i was 23 when i got here oh i was working
10111.140000000001,10116.580000000002, crappy retail jobs at uh well at a store that sold like movies and video games and whatnot
10117.46,10124.02, and uh i i had done a bunch of writing i did like a bunch of reviews that i uh i published on game
10124.02,10129.94, spot you know you could read it you did some staff away ransom game spot i did i did that too and um
10129.94,10133.46, are they still there can we dig them off if someone searches can be there are there are my two
10134.9,10142.02, first published articles are um on gamespot.com on their their old game spotting feature if you if you
10142.1,10148.58, look you can find them yeah but um i i did all these reviews i put together this big writing portfolio
10148.58,10156.9, i took it to e3 and that didn't get me anywhere so i applied for a cgw internship and i was hired
10156.9,10162.82, on the strength of my writing samples now the game you mentioned those like things i i realized
10162.82,10169.94, that i had a letter the month in published in egm oh my god we got to find that you got to find it
10170.02,10174.34, it was like definitely like one of those things what was like like yeah i'm gonna like put
10174.34,10178.980000000001, myself on on their map with this shit i write them because i love them i'm right because i want to
10178.980000000001,10183.460000000001, get a job one day like that sad issue you know i work but i got to learn the month you know what
10183.460000000001,10187.78, though it was supposed to win it was some sorry as crap anyway it was like when game shark was
10187.78,10191.78, sponsoring it or something you know like those cheat devices and they never those cheat passes never
10191.78,10195.94, sent it to me they never did you call them on it later after you got the job i figured
10195.94,10201.140000000001, got the job yeah i wasn't gonna call up uh believe you guys uh oh me a game shark deluxe for PS2
10202.58,10208.980000000001, what did you your letter she i what made it letter the month i don't know me i don't want
10208.980000000001,10212.66, to read that you bear i think it was i can point people this issue because i remember safe
10212.66,10219.460000000001, and i was like yes my name is print bitches letters column right here and that was it
10219.460000000001,10223.060000000001, you're like for the fantasy cover i don't remember which you'll have to get away with the
10223.14,10227.46, fuck more is this specific than that i'm just pointing people in the right direction you're like
10227.46,10234.1, that you're gonna find a fantasy um ten cover maybe okay that reason oh yeah i didn't know
10234.1,10239.619999999999, i know that i wanted to do this until like i the grad school phase my life that i was bringing up like
10239.619999999999,10243.699999999999, i thought i was going to do a number different things like i started off and i was actually
10243.699999999999,10250.1, like going for fine arts degree and in one quarter or one semester rather prior to completing
10250.1,10256.42, that the degree that um the BFA i changed my mind and switched over to literature like i just
10256.42,10261.86, there was so much that i got sick of in studio arts and um mainly it was just like a bunch of
10261.86,10266.34, the casino bunch of fucking shitty finger paintings and people breaking down about like it's i have
10266.34,10272.1, ever seen the movie um ghost world it's bad based on a graphic novel you know the art school
10272.1,10277.78, section and that where there they're like art students and there's just one kid and well
10277.94,10281.54, there's all this like random abstract stuff and the teacher just loves the app but then there's this one
10282.1,10287.060000000001, where um well Thorne birch is character she just does these cool comics you know teachers
10287.060000000001,10290.42, all dismissive of that and they show this other one and it's like a guy
10291.78,10295.7, you're killing someone the chainsaw or something and the teacher's like oh is this like
10295.7,10299.060000000001, is this your father or is this like representing you know it's like trying to get some kind of
10299.060000000001,10306.820000000002, awkward edible thing and the kids like uh that's the mutilator and that's uh i'm just all
10306.9,10311.539999999999, shitty like that but so yeah anyway like that was kind of my impression after a while like
10311.539999999999,10318.98, this is like switched over to that and then after like getting that degree then i got into
10318.98,10323.46, the green creative writing and i thought that i wanted to teach that and that i wanted it at the
10323.46,10327.06, same time because you you want to teach creative writing because that's what you do to fund yourself
10327.06,10331.38, until you can write get a book published or or to get articles published and stuff you know so yeah
10331.38,10336.1, like creative creative nonfiction and stuff as well and then all through grad school i just played
10336.1,10340.1, games i mean two of my closest friends jb and cam i have no idea if they even know like
10340.1,10344.18, what i'm up to these days but like we play team four to solve the time and a number of other
10344.18,10348.5, games and all we ever did was just like go out of our classes we'd meet in the break after we
10348.5,10353.220000000001, got to teach in a class and talk about what we were going to go do in our tfc clan that night
10353.220000000001,10357.62, and at some point i mean and i was kind of like their filter since i was like reading you know
10357.62,10362.18, egm and other stuff at the time i was like such a lab room right in get a computer
10362.26,10369.62, until then so that was like um like 1999 or something i didn't get my first computer till
10369.62,10374.26, and then like like internet after that and so i didn't even know about like websites and shit
10374.98,10379.86, and then on along the way i just was like why don't i combine the two you know the writing
10379.86,10383.54, in the games and then as soon as i made up my mind to do that then i just started uh
10384.42,10389.300000000001, writing the samples and i was at the grocery store at the time too working like a two a.m.
10389.3,10394.34, shifted on weekends so i would just write on my breaks you know like it'd be like
10394.34,10398.74, all quite dark in a parking lot so all the drugs had already gone home and i was just kind of nice
10398.74,10402.019999999999, actually yeah and just sit there and writing that i got so much more done i swear i could write
10402.019999999999,10406.5, like full stories and like you know week whereas like now the months and i can't get shit them
10406.5,10410.34, because i'm always distracted but this was like the other good thing you know it's like yeah you're
10410.34,10414.82, just forced to sit there there's absolutely nothing to do and you can either read and the the main key
10414.9,10420.66, so i really appreciate everyone who does some kind of like work that they don't necessarily like you
10420.66,10425.06, know like i mean i associate with blue collar work in that because for some reason doing anything
10425.06,10430.1, where you're you're being paid for mental work seems like a luxury but because it forces you
10430.1,10434.82, to really treasure every free moment you have especially in summers and you do that shit for
10434.82,10440.98, 40 or 48 hours a week you get a day off like you cannot i couldn't ever sit home i'd always have
10440.98,10444.9, to do something i gotta go to bed this weekend i gotta go to the river i gotta go kayak and
10444.9,10450.5, or something because that we can't be over so fast and i'm going to be set my alarm again for like 1 a.m.
10450.5,10455.38, and it's totally gonna suck ass so the brakes were the same way it was like i got i got 15 minutes
10455.38,10459.46, to myself right now bitch you can't tell me what i'm going to do with them so i'd go right
10459.46,10463.14, it's true that's that's an amazing thing of i mean like nowadays if you work in an
10463.14,10469.38, office it's like you get your you know you too break every 20 minutes or something you're like
10469.38,10473.539999999999, hanging out with your friends and talking about whatever and maybe you're working a little bit
10473.539999999999,10480.019999999999, or whatever it's a post that you got to show you up and like yeah punching in to a job
10480.019999999999,10485.06, punching out for a 10 minute break yeah and coming back a minute late and being scolded for it yeah
10485.06,10490.019999999999, where were you when you would get like two of those in the whole day oh my god so you would
10490.019999999999,10494.019999999999, definitely like i remember that was another luxury of working that kind of work is that if you
10494.02,10498.1, never have to like shit or piss you'd save that you wouldn't do it on your break and then you
10498.1,10501.86, would feel like that would be your one way of sticking to the man you're taking like an especially
10501.86,10512.74, powerful do you like i'm paying for this yet oh i i'd still really relish to you this let's
10512.74,10518.18, let's let Jeff get another oh not just gonna say i'm i was just gonna try and get back to Jeff
10518.18,10522.82, yeah so Jeff what do we are you still there did you hang up on us no i'm still here
10522.82,10528.82, alright man let's go back to you that was a long-ass response no it's good um is it weird
10528.82,10534.66, like listening to a snippet of the broodio like ahead of time like i know the broodio of the future
10534.66,10540.82, it's coming through myself on speaker which i'm not really used to yeah do we all sound like the
10540.82,10547.86, same guy yeah it's kind of uh kind of fun-nerving actually you're on the broodio dude
10548.58,10557.380000000001, that's s of questions man um do that be like gaming related now if it's whatever you want man it
10557.380000000001,10565.060000000001, could be like what kind of underwear like Ryan wears i don't know octaves of grief yeah um okay
10565.78,10573.220000000001, what is everybody's favorite pizza we actually fight over this yeah we fight a lot Ryan
10573.3,10577.859999999999, i usually win usually well you usually put me because i'm the one he does the order yeah
10578.5,10582.66, but when we're on the magazines we have what are called deadline dinners you know and it's like
10582.66,10589.06, oh he's trying with always get uh one order pizza and he'd always get this place called a
10589.06,10597.14, meat cheese and it's like the best pizza in the area breezy shitty f***ing like what it's i don't know
10597.14,10603.06, like the thing is pizza snob is always an issue and we had an old copy editor um it's
10603.14,10607.779999999999, she's gone now but she's she's actually moved back to like to to New York City uh exact
10607.779999999999,10612.42, and they're all here to say New York people from New York and Norse Chicago wherever it's like
10612.42,10615.859999999999, pizza snob is not drives me crazy and like you'll you be having some pizza and be like uh
10615.859999999999,10620.98, so much better New York same thing for the bagel you know uh um but the kind of pizza she would want
10620.98,10625.46, was like a mechis and i'm like this is really New York the f***ed at like this is i know it's like
10625.46,10630.42, fight words so a lot of people out there but like sorry i mean maybe i'll try it like the legit in
10630.42,10634.58, New York one day now i'm not gonna be so far away from it but like the way that New York gets
10634.58,10640.42, ripped out here it's not like good i i'm just sort of sick of the sort of inferiority complex
10640.42,10645.54, at the bay area has when it comes to pizza there's amazing pizza in the bay area i don't think
10645.54,10649.78, it's at a mechis okay now i i don't i don't i don't think that it's New York style
10649.78,10656.42, pizza that's more great here to do California the bay area does great sourdough based pizza like
10656.42,10662.02, the cheeseboard collective in the east bay where it's all about what we're gonna not stop it over
10662.02,10666.74, okay sorry that would have been a disaster but like there's a kind of pizza out here and this is you
10666.74,10671.22, know definitely among my favorite kinds of pizza where uh the cheeseboard collective it's all about
10671.22,10676.42, sourdough crust and they put all kinds of fresh California it's kind of toppings like great cheese
10676.42,10680.9, and great vegetables it'll it'll be kind of unusual like sometimes during the summer summer they'll
10680.9,10685.78, have like corn pizza with like a twist of lime which i know is like sounds horrible the most
10685.86,10690.02, people that kind of stuff is actually really good it's really good and then they recover we
10690.02,10694.74, could cover asses by saying we like like traditional Italian style stuff too where it's like super thin
10694.74,10699.140000000001, crust you know yeah that's my that's actually my favorite kind of that's my favorite kind of pizza
10699.140000000001,10702.820000000002, it was like baked on the fucking uh gravity at Jupiter or something yeah like a like a like a
10702.820000000002,10707.86, like a the politics and style pizza yeah that's what i make at home like i make i make you know
10707.86,10714.02, straight up marker pizza margarita you know buffalo mozzarella little bit of sauce and some fresh basil
10714.1,10719.86, on a killer crust yeah that sounds good but like also also to give credit to the California
10719.86,10725.380000000001, and it's it's like the whole west coast style thing like there's this pizza i get from a fucking
10725.380000000001,10733.460000000001, place called pizza extreme no less wait that's the place that's connected by court to uh to high
10733.460000000001,10739.62, tech burrito high tech burrito is is owned by the same people who own extra there's a place called
10739.7,10744.900000000001, high tech burrito yeah yeah that's fucked up yeah anyway that makes me sad but there's like
10744.900000000001,10749.300000000001, there's a pizza there actually now this is just watch others a pizza they're called peace in the
10749.300000000001,10756.58, middle east and it's like the peace like you know a slice but it's got like hummus on it and artichoke
10756.58,10762.58, hearts and fucking calma to all of this sounds fucking good and like it's like a Mediterranean like
10762.58,10766.18, style maneuver on there and it's good man and now I think of it that's probably something like
10766.18,10771.62, the most like the worst abomination anyone I probably just has a bunch of people being like californians
10771.62,10776.34, or idiots what it comes to what about what about I mean I like New York style pizza in New York I've
10776.34,10781.86, had great pizza in New York but I don't think it's like the ultimate in pizza or anything right I
10781.86,10786.98, appreciate pizzas from various regions the ultimate in pizza was Jeff's school lunch and did I heard
10786.98,10795.220000000001, they had those like little cubicle pepperoni's there Jeff what what you're your favorite pizza is

10807.06,10813.779999999999, avoid a pizza it's cool because you know because the cute pepperoni was that yeah I was gonna ask
10813.779999999999,10817.22, like where you went to school because I I had this theory that like the school lunch is the same
10817.22,10820.66, throughout the entire country that everyone like you name the pizza and everyone gets the same
10820.74,10826.18, visual of like three strands of mozzarella melted over like a fucking piece of she leather and like
