29.82,36.14," It is September 25th, 2007."
36.14,37.14, I'm lying.
37.14,39.1, It's the 24th one we're recording it.
39.1,44.86, You are listening to it on the 25th because that's the kind of magic we work here.
44.86,52.900000000000006," And I am here with the GFW crew, all minus one, but those who are here are as follows."
52.9,54.9, Sharing Lads known.
54.9,57.5, Sean Elliott and Sean Moloi.
57.5,61.78," And poor Ryan Scott, he's here, he's sitting in his desk, but he's all sniffly."
61.78,66.34, And he didn't want to come to the mic because he was worried that his sniffly voice
66.34,67.34, was going to...
67.34,68.34, You're so enthusiastic.
68.34,71.58, What is a sick Ryan Scott sound like?
71.58,73.58, That like...
73.58,76.18, You know I was thinking it wasn't a...
76.18,80.78, But he did write a letter that he wanted me to read before we started here.
80.78,83.62," It goes, dear, adoring fan."
83.62,87.54, And then you got acid parentheses.
87.54,89.7, Greenings and sanitations.
89.7,90.7, That's not nice.
90.7,91.7, No more.
91.7,95.66," Help, help, no."
95.66,100.38, I've decided to mercifully spare you all from the horrid sounds of my sniffling and sneezing.
100.38,101.38, Whoa.
101.38,102.38, So you'll just have to...
102.38,103.38, The horrid fucking sounds there.
103.38,104.38, There's some converges.
104.38,105.38, Yeah.
105.38,107.38, They're just like a super back Washington.
107.38,108.38, Sorry.
109.38,113.66, So you have to find some way to get through this week's podcast without my usual helping
113.66,115.66, of long-winded input.
115.66,118.94, I see we did it there.
118.94,121.61999999999999, Here are a couple of thoughts to keep you going until next week.
121.61999999999999,125.82," One, Team Fortress 2 is fun for a shooter."
125.82,129.46," Also if you see a guy named Ryduk playing, please don't kill me."
129.46,132.14, Two Halo 3 sucks.
132.14,133.14, Yours in...
133.14,136.26, And then he has a word Christ out and then Kathulu.
136.26,137.26, So yours in Kathulu.
137.82,138.42, Wow.
138.42,139.82, Ryan.
139.82,140.82, Okay.
140.82,142.94, So yeah.
142.94,146.94, That's Ryan Scott for this week's folks send your hate mail to him if you have any.
146.94,148.1, And just issues.
148.1,149.38," And if you're right, Doug."
149.38,151.34," And if you see right, Doug online, shoot him."
151.34,152.1, And shoot him.
152.1,153.82, Yeah.
153.82,157.01999999999998, So yeah.
157.01999999999998,157.94, Here we are.
157.94,161.45999999999998, It's Halo 3 Eve.
161.45999999999998,163.26, We'll talk about that a little bit here.
163.26,167.1, I guess it'll be Halo Day by the time everybody plays it or listen to this.
167.18,170.22," I mean, we've all been playing other things."
170.22,174.74, I think Darren's been playing a little Halo 3 so far.
174.74,176.66, But also we have to talk about other than those.
176.66,177.66, A lot of games.
177.66,178.66, We've got a lot of...
178.66,181.26, All of our spots are going to get into this.
181.26,183.26, Fortress forever.
183.26,184.82, It's time for time out.
184.82,185.82, Fortress forever.
185.82,186.82, Yep.
186.82,189.01999999999998, Got a lot on our plate.
189.01999999999998,191.29999999999998, Now also we have heroes tonight.
191.29999999999998,192.94," Oh, we'll get out of here."
192.94,195.98, But I'm going to put in the little public service announcement before we go.
195.98,199.78, But here's the educational part of the podcast.
199.78,202.57999999999998, Did any of you guys watch the Ken Burns thing?
202.57999999999998,203.57999999999998, Yep.
203.57999999999998,204.57999999999998, Are you planning on it?
204.57999999999998,205.57999999999998, No.
205.57999999999998,206.57999999999998, No.
206.57999999999998,207.57999999999998, No.
207.57999999999998,208.57999999999998, I don't actually know what you're talking about.
208.57999999999998,209.57999999999998," Oh, the war."
209.57999999999998,210.57999999999998," Oh, the war."
210.57999999999998,211.57999999999998, Yeah.
211.57999999999998,212.57999999999998, I can't say my cable.
212.57999999999998,213.57999999999998, So you need to t-bo inform me.
213.57999999999998,214.57999999999998," It's PBS, man."
214.57999999999998,215.57999999999998, It's channel.
215.57999999999998,216.57999999999998, I don't even have...
216.57999999999998,217.57999999999998, I don't get even the free channels.
217.57999999999998,218.57999999999998, He don't.
218.57999999999998,219.57999999999998, Wow.
219.57999999999998,220.57999999999998," Well, you have a crap reception."
220.57999999999998,221.57999999999998, Is that the day?
221.57999999999998,222.57999999999998," Yeah, it's just..."
222.57999999999998,223.57999999999998, You're like living without TV.
223.57999999999998,224.57999999999998," Yeah, I really did."
224.58,225.58, I went.
225.58,230.58, I think about eight or nine years from time I was an undergrad through a couple years after
230.58,231.58, it.
231.58,233.18, That's why I like you've read all those books and stuff.
233.18,234.58," Well, I didn't play it so many games."
234.58,239.9," Between no assertive between books and games, between reading and gaming, there's just"
239.9,240.9, not so much time for it.
240.9,241.9," Well, you can watch stuff online."
241.9,243.54000000000002," You missed all that pop culture, though."
243.54000000000002,244.54000000000002, But I will be...
244.54000000000002,245.9, I'm fine for when Lost comes out.
245.9,246.9, I can watch it online.
246.9,247.9, Battlestars can be a...
247.9,249.54000000000002, So you missed like nine years of TV.
249.54000000000002,252.54000000000002," So if we make like save by the belljokes and stuff, you'll just be gone."
252.54000000000002,253.54000000000002, Oh.
253.54000000000002,254.54000000000002, That's the wrong time frame.
254.54,259.82, So I missed it in the hot air when it was like just when Lincoln Park and Limbiscuit
259.82,262.82, and all the shit ass bands were like blowing up.
262.82,264.82, And the whole Carson Daily thing.
264.82,267.09999999999997, So like I'd hear about all that.
267.09999999999997,269.09999999999997," But yeah, shit doesn't mean anything to me either."
269.09999999999997,270.09999999999997, Yeah.
270.09999999999997,271.09999999999997, I think I'm better off without it.
271.09999999999997,272.46, I think you probably are.
272.46,275.14, But Ken Burns' War is quite good.
275.14,276.7, And we watch the first part.
276.7,280.21999999999997, And just made me think while I was watching it.
280.21999999999997,283.14, Not to start off and it kind of old man dad sort of way.
283.14,284.53999999999996, And it did make me think.
284.53999999999996,286.5," Boy, I've been playing a lot of World War II games."
286.5,288.09999999999997," Oh, it's something else we're going to talk about."
288.09999999999997,289.09999999999997, Yeah.
289.09999999999997,290.09999999999997, Let's go right in now.
290.09999999999997,291.41999999999996, And we'll go and we'll make that transition.
291.41999999999996,292.41999999999996, Yeah.
292.41999999999996,294.38," But I was thinking, you know, there's probably a lot of people out there."
294.38,299.06, A lot of kids out there who are playing these games and really don't have much context.
299.06,302.78, And history class here in the US can be pretty fucking boring and bad.
302.78,305.94," A lot of bad hits, history teachers."
305.94,307.9, And a lot of great ones too.
307.9,309.9, And I salute you.
310.14,315.94, But Ken Burns has a really nice job at least so far in giving the giving World
315.94,322.62, War II a really a digestible context in which to learn about it.
322.62,324.02, So I recommend it.
324.02,325.02, Interesting.
325.02,326.02," Oh, there you go."
326.02,329.7, I'm sure I'd like to talk about it if I want to get the chance to see it.
329.7,330.9, On that World War II note.
330.9,331.9, Yeah.
331.9,338.9, Sometime ago we made a point of saying that we're video game reviews are concerned.
338.9,345.78, Any time a writer is going to say something about a World War II first person shooter.
345.78,348.97999999999996, They begin their review in exactly the same way.
348.97999999999996,353.06," So what we did is we just went at, you know, near random, I just searched for reviews"
353.06,358.29999999999995," for various, you know, reviews of World War II of games, you know, World War II franchises."
358.29999999999995,359.46, And we read from tons.
359.46,361.78," You know, they were on every website and every magazine."
361.78,364.21999999999997," That was like four or five months ago, maybe."
364.21999999999997,365.21999999999997, Sounds bad right.
365.21999999999997,366.21999999999997, It was quite some time ago.
366.26000000000005,370.66," You know, if you're, if you start listening since then, that's the just of it."
370.66,374.02000000000004," And I just want to continue to track this until I see this like,"
374.02000000000004,377.26000000000005," read, read, read, read, read, read, read, read, read, read, read."
377.26000000000005,379.58000000000004," So a one man crusade, a one magazine crusade."
379.58000000000004,380.58000000000004, Yeah.
380.58000000000004,384.34000000000003, So here we go from game pros review of Medal of Honor Airborne.
384.34000000000003,387.82000000000005," And again, nothing against the magazines and the people involved here."
387.82000000000005,393.42, This is just like I'm challenging you to find some other way to write an intro for
393.5,395.7, review for a World War II FES.
395.7,402.42," And so we have, okay, I know what you're thinking, not another World War II theme shooter."
402.42,407.22, But don't let go of your M1 Garan's just yet as Medal of Honor Airborne has enough new ideas
407.22,409.46000000000004, to make you reconsider.
409.46000000000004,417.98," Nusswitching over to to have your PC gamer, same Medal of Honor Airborne begins."
417.98,421.18, It's unfortunate that World War II is such an overplayed game setting.
421.26,424.98, I play through the battles fought by the greatest generation so many times that every new
424.98,428.98, derivative World War II shooter seems to diminish its incredible sacrifice.
428.98,433.34000000000003," Fortunately, Airborne's excellent new parachuting mechanic takes Nazi smashing to a new place."
433.34000000000003,434.34000000000003, Up.
434.34000000000003,439.62," So the thing that I'm pointing out there, you know, to repeat myself now, since this is nothing"
439.62,445.06, more than just a place to put repeating ourselves under a microscope.
445.98,451.7, And it's just that that intro was more played out than a World War II FES of course.
451.7,456.5," And it continues to be, but then the real thing that's hilarious is that they all have that twist"
456.5,457.5, at the end.
457.5,460.98," Okay, you're sick of these, but it's fucking one."
460.98,465.1," Yeah, you know, like, and it doesn't matter what it is, it could be any game to outright,"
465.1,467.62," you know, by relic for console, it really doesn't matter."
467.62,469.62," Take a look, find if it's a preview."
469.62,474.46," Sometimes, in a review, they might flop and say, well, yeah, this is that derivative one."
474.53999999999996,478.02," In 100% of previews, though, just look around in the craziest press."
478.02,479.26, They've all got that twist.
479.26,483.14," Yeah, that is a great thing because it's like for so for every, every World War II game"
483.14,487.58," in the past two years, they've all sucked except for this one in this article right now."
488.21999999999997,489.06, It's in your core.
489.06,490.34, Maybe my favorite board listener.
490.34,494.94," Maybe you got a desk job and the managers, not watching you."
494.94,499.26," Try to compile like a master list of every, I mean, you'll, you obviously be able to look"
499.26,502.78," online stuff, but if you also subscribe to magazines, try to compile a master list."
502.78,507.26, Like that would be rad to have in one place where we can just look and read that thing
507.26,508.5, over and over again.
508.5,511.94," And it's time for a new time for a new lead there, I think."
511.94,512.9399999999999, Yeah.
512.9399999999999,516.54, And it's weird because we had this problem even before I was at this magazine.
516.54,517.54," Oh, yeah."
517.54,518.54, Point this out.
518.54,520.5," Another magazine to go, ah, hi, it is again."
520.5,524.3399999999999," It's like it's been going on for endless, endless eons."
524.3399999999999,525.3399999999999, Yeah.
525.3399999999999,530.98," Since we're, you know, we're, we're, we're, we're point fingers like we like to do."
530.98,531.98, Right.
531.98,533.78, So this is a very specific case.
533.78,536.78," Yeah, we're something like I said, we're not saying, yeah, these guys suck."
536.78,540.74," These guys are idiots are bad, but we're saying that it's like, hey, you can even have"
540.74,542.34, a friend and he does some annoying thing.
542.34,545.4200000000001," He's like, burping all the time and it smells like raw ass."
545.4200000000001,549.58," Like you can tell like, dude, your best smells like shit, but you still your friend."
549.58,550.98," Uh, you know what I'm saying?"
550.98,553.86," Like so you can, you can chill out on the intro."
553.86,555.74, That's hard to do though.
555.74,557.74, Tell friend that.
557.74,559.22, It is that I just did it.
559.22,562.0600000000001, It's like the guy who who smelled really bad here at the office.
562.0600000000001,563.0600000000001, Yeah.
563.0600000000001,565.34," You know, I'm talking about, I don't know about that."
565.34,567.98, And I'm going to interrupt you before you tell me a story.
567.98,569.3000000000001, Not what's in you.
569.3000000000001,574.82," There's the classic guy who used to wear shorts in his ball sec, would hang out."
574.82,575.82, Of shorts.
575.82,580.22, And they had to tell him to put his nut away like the HR department had to hear?
580.22,581.22, Yes.
581.22,582.22, What?
582.22,585.1800000000001," Before I worked here though, I heard all this from the, you know, guys."
585.1800000000001,587.5," And they had to tell, yeah, HR department then get them."
587.5,588.5," Oh, wait."
588.5,589.5, I think it's not a way.
589.5,592.3, And then he said to start wearing pants.
592.3,593.3, That's a true story.
593.3,594.3, I think I remember that one.
594.3,595.3, I haven't confirmed.
595.3,596.3, Did he wear boxer?
596.3,597.3, So what?
597.3,598.3, I don't know.
598.3,599.3, Something was up.
599.3,600.3, Clearly.
600.3,601.3, Okay.
601.3,602.7, That's better than my story.
602.7,603.7, What's this?
603.7,604.7, What's going to happen?
604.7,607.02, That was just somebody who like smelled so bad.
607.02,608.5, It wasn't on our side of the building.
608.5,611.5," It was in the, in the sales department, which is a really bad thing."
611.5,613.02," You know, I want to stinky salesman."
613.02,614.02, Yeah.
614.02,615.02," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
615.02,617.46," But he smelled so bad that, you know."
617.46,621.82," Nobody had the nerve to do anything, you know, and it was the, like, they had the, like,"
621.82,625.3000000000001," put a note in his mailbox, you know, deer, deer, whoever."
625.3000000000001,626.3000000000001, Yeah.
626.3000000000001,627.3000000000001, There was stink.
627.3000000000001,628.3000000000001, Love anonymous.
628.3000000000001,629.3000000000001, One of the side bathing.
629.3000000000001,632.74," So when you were in the, uh, the whole, the whole, the whole, the whole,"
632.74,636.7800000000001," Mike, who was basically like a circus side show, but the one, one of the dudes, and"
636.7800000000001,641.6600000000001," we had nicknames for all them and like one of them was, uh, well, there's child"
641.6600000000001,644.82," shoe, which I got to point out, because he had like a size four shoe or something."
644.82,645.82, That doesn't look like that.
645.82,646.82, We've got a C S though.
646.82,647.82, So he never knew.
647.82,651.82," And then, but this other for, he smelled just like you're saying, like, you know,"
651.82,653.1400000000001, like an hour house with feet.
653.1400000000001,657.46, But you'd have to start like he'd have to go face now with that guy.
657.46,658.46, Yeah.
658.46,659.46, Did you have a fake?
659.46,661.46," Yeah, this guy was really stuck."
661.46,665.0200000000001," I mean, when I was in, when I would be in a meeting with him, I would have to just"
665.0200000000001,669.3000000000001," like, you know, breathe through my mouth just so I went, inhale the BL through my nose, you know,"
669.3000000000001,673.58," just be like, please, please get out."
673.58,678.34," And when I was a kid, my dad actually, he, he worked at a bag for a long time, but"
678.34,681.7800000000001, then he was self-employed and in real estate and he shared the office with these two of
681.7800000000001,685.62, the guys and he would come home at night and he would talk about the guys he worked with.
685.62,688.46, And one of them and my dad has nicknames for everybody.
688.46,692.94, So one guy was Captain Crunch because he looked like the guy on the box.
692.94,695.0600000000001, But the other guy was pit.
695.0600000000001,696.9000000000001, And I thought like that was the guy's name.
696.9000000000001,697.9000000000001," You know, Randy Pit."
697.9000000000001,700.9000000000001," So whatever, it's because the guy's stunk."
701.86,702.86, Because it was armpits.
702.86,703.86, Yeah.
703.86,705.34, Did you call him that to his face?
705.34,706.34, One time.
706.34,707.34," Oh, yeah."
707.34,708.34," I'm a, I'm Mr. Pit."
708.34,709.34, Excuse me.
709.34,711.34," Yeah, I hope I didn't do that."
711.34,713.34, Why do we talking about?
713.34,717.22, We had to get off to wave off to.
717.22,720.34," I don't just jump right in the team for just since we've all, but yeah, let's do that."
720.34,721.9, Even Ryan was playing team for just to.
721.9,722.9," Yeah, crap."
722.9,723.9, That's right.
723.9,724.9, He was a medic.
724.9,725.9, That's how good it is.
725.9,726.9, He's still playing right now.
726.9,727.9," Yeah, he's still playing."
727.9,730.86, So we came over to watch me play.
730.86,733.86," Today, as far as I know, that's what happened."
733.86,736.86," I mean, he was watching me play and he was looking at it."
736.86,742.86," And then he started asking, well, you said, yeah, you know, when you're a view that there's some kids that are more accessible and others."
742.86,750.86," And I was like, hey, you could be the medic and you can, uh, when you could be the heavy weapons guy or the engineer or the pyro, those are your options."
750.86,752.86, And then he went back to his desk and installed it.
752.86,755.86," As soon as he learned about support classes, he was all over it."
755.86,756.86, Yeah.
756.86,759.86, And that is one of the things that about this game.
759.86,766.86," It's, yeah, the, for me, like, as, you know, I've talked about this before, but as the die hard team for chess classic player,"
766.86,772.86," um, the medic is the most change between between games and medic was my kid."
772.86,773.86, Mm-hmm.
773.86,777.86," And it's very much like a fighting game, you know, like it, and when they change in between,"
777.86,780.86," um, sequels, your character, it throws you off."
780.86,782.86," You know, like, oh, man, this is like, do you feel betrayed?"
782.86,788.86," It's not my game, you know, but, um, but eventually, you know, fighting game, you go on and pick a new character, whatever that, you know, suits your style."
788.86,794.86," But the thing is, as you get used to that because fighting game sequels come out fairly rapidly, this was nine years in between."
794.86,796.86, I didn't play for all nine years.
796.86,800.86," But I played for a good many of that, nine years, more and more of them than I did."
800.86,805.86," Um, did you guys ever see the old team, the first time they showed team for just two and three?"
805.86,806.86, Yeah.
806.86,808.86," It was like, it was like, modern warfare stuff."
808.86,809.86, Yeah.
809.86,810.86, It was basically different.
810.86,811.86, It was like battlefield.
811.86,812.86, Yeah.
812.86,817.86," And they, they were spending a great deal of time working on, you know, a role for a commander,"
817.86,820.86," which, you know, first appeared in battlefield, right?"
820.86,821.86, Right.
821.86,822.86, Right.
822.86,823.86, Stuff like that.
823.86,827.86," But the medic yet now, he's, uh, if you, you want to spend a lifetime right in bitch."
827.86,829.86," I mean, he's your man."
829.86,831.86," You just, uh, go around with the medic."
831.86,832.86, Go around with the hose.
832.86,833.86, It was a medic a lot.
833.86,835.86, The medic is totally necessary.
835.86,837.86," But it's not, it's totally necessary."
837.86,838.86, There's no doubt about that.
838.86,840.86, He strengthens your team.
840.86,841.86, Yeah.
841.86,844.86," Offensively and defensively, but personally, you have to understand."
844.86,849.86," I, I, I very much like high risk, high reward characters and, uh, classes rather."
849.86,851.86, They're characters too now.
851.86,856.86," Um, and there's just not much to him."
856.86,858.86," I mean, it's, you know, you can make a case for yet."
858.86,862.86," It's, it's tactics to know when to use your, uh, your overcharge."
862.86,865.86," But I mean, you don't even have to, when you're holding your lovo's down."
865.86,867.86," You just, you find someone, you sweep it around."
867.86,869.86," And then he's like, okay, that's the one."
869.86,871.86, And you press the button right holding your locked.
871.86,873.86," And then you just kind of, if, if your fingers move enough to,"
873.86,877.86," to, to the was the, just kind of follow him around with your lovo's on."
877.86,880.86," And I mean, well, yeah, that's a great way for people to get in the game."
880.86,884.86," But I'm saying for me and my temper man going from person who would, you know,"
884.86,888.86," Conc, jump, try to, you know, capture flags and get in by the skin of my teeth,"
888.86,893.86," kill an SG with a nail gun, you know, use my grenades to do this and that and get in and out."
893.86,897.86, Like it's radical for totally a reason why I flock to that right at the beginning.
897.86,900.86," And that's just the, it is the entry point."
900.86,901.86, Yeah.
901.86,902.86, You can just on me.
902.86,903.86, You don't have to or the map.
903.86,905.86," You just kind of like, you're talking to someone."
905.86,908.86, And I see some clever uses of the medic too.
908.86,911.86, Like I've seen like two medics on one guy.
911.86,912.86," You know, like, clever."
912.86,913.86, Come on.
913.86,915.86, That's the banana right is.
915.86,921.86," But I mean, you know, as a way of, you know, of almost being like,"
921.86,925.86," Involvenable, you know, as a charge, it's a way to charge into a capture point."
925.86,928.86," You know, yeah, it's totally, it's great and hey, and you love it."
928.86,931.86," I, I wasn't a game and it exposed to all when we were sitting there."
931.86,934.86, I was talking to you with another team for just classic vet.
934.86,938.86," And we were, you know, calming in all the various changes and what they've done to the game and what we were saying."
938.86,942.86," Oh, God, but the medic though, what happened to him and we were saying the whole thing."
942.86,946.86," And like we were, we're also upset because the guy, the server host was on the other team."
946.86,950.86," And he was like playing, you know, big corona and he had a bunch of feast little,"
950.86,955.86, Schweelers who would play medic and follow him around exactly as you're saying a couple of them.
955.86,957.86," And then so, you know, we were telling, we were saying that team."
957.86,961.86," And asking them, you know, how, how does it feel to spend a lot of your whole life right in the pitch."
961.86,965.86, They were getting mad in the big the HW guys was getting mad too.
965.86,968.86," But so anyway, I got to a point where I was like, shit, I need a medic."
968.86,970.86, And then there's a medic next to us.
970.86,973.86, And I just got done talking shit on what they did to medic.
973.86,976.86," And like, but hey, I still appreciate this someone wants to play."
976.86,978.86, So you have me up.
978.86,979.86, Yeah.
979.86,983.86," I mean, when I was on server's this weekend, you know, I was on teams where no one wanted to be it."
983.86,986.86, And we would almost invariably lose.
986.86,989.86, And I think almost directly for that reason.
989.86,991.86, Definitely depends on the map.
991.86,997.86," The great like you're saying when you have like in Dust Bowl or something where you have massively concentrated,"
997.86,1002.86," defenses with with building units, century guns and stuff, you know,"
1002.86,1004.86, it gets to a point.
1004.86,1011.86, And then it also provided that they have pyros there's a spy check that your spies alone aren't enough to do anything other than create confusion.
1011.86,1016.86, And you have to have that overcharge HWGI going there and rip up all the SG's so you can get in.
1016.86,1017.86, It's great for that.
1017.86,1020.86," Other maps that are like much, you know, more high speed and stuff."
1020.86,1021.86, You don't need to do it.
1021.86,1026.8600000000001," I mean, by the like if you're quick enough with your offense, you won't even get to the point where, you know,"
1026.8600000000001,1031.8600000000001, you got to have fatty walk all the way up to the front lines from on the backfield.
1031.8600000000001,1036.8600000000001, I've got to say the the look of this game is so awesome.
1036.8600000000001,1040.8600000000001, I haven't been this in love with a game's look in a long time.
1040.86,1042.86," Yeah, I just it's so cool."
1042.86,1046.86, It's and it scales up and down until you can be on a really crummy system and it still looks great.
1046.86,1053.86," I really didn't know what to think at first, you know, I I was style you didn't not that I didn't like it."
1053.86,1059.86, I was just I was I was surprised by it just in seemed very valve.
1059.86,1061.86, It made absolute sense.
1061.86,1063.86, It does totally make sense.
1063.86,1069.86, What is the old format of team it's you have to slate gray concrete bases in random dudes in this weird.
1069.86,1078.86, He never never land like what the fuck are these guys doing right what are these bases why do they want this fucking flag so bad and they took all that and said.
1078.86,1089.86," Hey, how can we answer that yeah and again, I mean, I think when you when you look at games out there that are similar space shadow run would be an example or something."
1089.86,1093.86, And no one has had any why did it takes so long for this specific solution.
1093.86,1098.86," Yeah, the visual solution right because it's wonderful and they can't trust really makes it stand out because."
1098.86,1111.86," The other option is we know is the damn intergalactic blood sport and that's you know that applies for doom and for unreal and you're like yeah, we just got all these dudes in space and they like kill each other for like."
1111.86,1115.86," Yeah, I should make it never gets a little bit on to watch this."
1115.86,1119.86, It never just watching other people play it still so fun all the animations.
1119.86,1125.86, The body types of all that are for characters and the body types which makes sense with the kind of class you're going to play.
1125.86,1134.86, And it might be the first time to that I've even that I recall seeing a multiplayer game of this nature where there's so much attention put on to.
1134.86,1145.86, Various aspects of animation so for example when you go from a full sprint forward to back pedaling the fact that you change posture that you're jumping when you're rocket jumping you know usually in games there's.
1146.86,1153.86, You know think of when you're in halo or something you jump you feet go up and you just are kind of in this pose you just stick the matrix pose.
1153.86,1161.86, And and in this I mean your feet are kicking around and every time you know when someone kills you and freezes the screen and it seems up to your killer freezes the screen on them.
1161.86,1164.86," Yeah, almost every single time it does that."
1164.86,1168.86, It looks like someone drew a character in a super expressive pose.
1168.86,1170.86," Yeah, it was a possibly game."
1170.86,1175.86, In a given mind I loved that every time it never gets hold of even with the music that.
1175.86,1178.86," Bam, bam, you know like a sexy spy."
1178.86,1182.86," Oh, and maybe that only comes when you get a new nemesis."
1182.86,1184.86," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
1184.86,1187.86," Yeah, and then you're dominating early."
1187.86,1193.86, I also like today when you were playing on the big monitor and various people walking by from one up in the sales people.
1193.86,1195.86, Everybody makes the same comment about.
1195.86,1198.86," Redrunner cartoon. Yeah, everyone."
1198.86,1209.86," Like to watch it in the first place, though, says something the fact that for one way to crowd the console dudes coming by and actually stopping for a second other than to make some kind of snider mark."
1209.86,1214.86, Is interesting and this was funny and it because Donna from EGM was by and looking.
1214.86,1218.86," He's like, oh, he's coming out on 3602 and he's watching."
1218.86,1222.86," He's like, wow, it's really fast because I was playing a scout at the moment, you know."
1222.86,1229.86," Oh, and he's like, well, it worked on a controller and it was funny because like I know you're so used to that crowd where."
1229.86,1233.86," God, it seems impossible to believe that there's still our people who think that."
1233.86,1237.86, Given the certain exceptions like Halo were from the very ground up.
1237.86,1243.86, It's built to be very slow game to think that maybe that the two interfaces are equally suited for the game.
1243.86,1247.86," It's funny to see him like, yeah, dude, now you know what I'm talking about."
1247.86,1251.86," I'm not just saying because I want to be like, pieces better or whatever."
1251.86,1256.86, It's like has nothing to do that. Like in the same way that I don't want to play.
1256.86,1259.86," Any, any, any number."
1259.86,1264.86, Like I wouldn't want to play basketball or like a fight night or something with a mouse keyboard.
1264.86,1266.86, Completely stupid.
1266.86,1270.86," Well, you know, of course all things will be equal on the 360 right?"
1270.86,1273.86," I mean, everybody will be playing with a controller obviously."
1273.86,1279.86," Yes, they will, you know, I mean, I'll be really interested to check it out on that platform to see how much different it plays."
1279.86,1280.86, Fuck that.
1280.86,1281.86, No way.
1281.86,1285.86," If I played it on that and it's like it's being, it's like being crippled."
1285.86,1286.86, Yeah.
1286.86,1289.86," I mean, in that game, do they get the exact same maps and I don't know for us to be the same game?"
1289.86,1297.86," Yeah, and it's just like, I mean, yeah, it's pretty much like playing with one hand type on your back or something."
1297.86,1302.86," I don't know why you'd want. I would not unless you, the obvious answers."
1302.86,1303.86, You don't have a PC.
1303.86,1304.86," Oh, yeah."
1304.86,1311.86," It's capable of running it or you just are completely, uh, incapable of using a mouse and a keyboard is a gaming interface."
1311.86,1315.86," Then if you want to play team fortress, then get it on this."
1315.86,1320.86," Um, not to transition yet into other games, but I think the same applies for portal and half life too as well."
1320.86,1326.86, There are definitely moments in those games where you want reaction time and the vehicle in half life too.
1326.86,1329.86, It's very clearly designed with the mouse and keyboard interface.
1329.86,1338.86," I'll also say about the look of it, too, that it, um, whatever reason for me, it, um, it makes it less intimidating."
1338.86,1344.86, Even though the core gameplay really is kind of as intimidating as as he's games always have been.
1344.86,1348.86, I just mean not as well as TFC.
1348.86,1352.86," Okay, maybe not to TFC, but, but that's you though."
1352.86,1355.86," Like, no, I would say for you. So here, here would be an example. Okay."
1355.86,1358.86," If you went into engineer now and you built the century, right?"
1358.86,1364.86," Yeah. Um, you, you know that like you build it and it's pretty much sustained itself, right?"
1364.86,1372.86," To be effective with that stuff, you would have to, I mean, because all characters, like almost all characters had a nail gun and the range was shorter, right?"
1372.86,1374.86, They were slower to traverse.
1374.86,1379.86," Um, it was, they, people would have taken your SGs out every single time before you ever got a single kill."
1379.86,1391.86," And if you detected that someone was coming in from its blind spot, you would have had to manually rotate it in anticipation by, you know, clicking open a menu and saying rotate SG 180 degrees or something."
1391.86,1396.86," Um, likewise, you would have had to know the difference between armor and health."
1396.86,1403.86," Um, and the armor, which is also what you're using for, you know, since there's just ammunition in this, which was a whole nothing."
1403.86,1406.86," And I mean, there's just, there's all these, okay, so you're subtle."
1406.86,1418.86," So I might actually be an easier game. But, but the look of it just to me, it, it makes it more, um, I don't know, just accessible, because the cartoon machine to it makes it attractive."
1418.86,1420.86, You want to play right?
1420.86,1421.86, Right.
1421.86,1433.86," You know, in a way, I hate to compare things to wow, but it kind of does that for me, kind of the same thing, you know, it's like to me yet another example of where you're almost better off with that kind of approach than ultra realistic."
1433.86,1434.86, Totally agree.
1434.86,1444.86," I'm trying to, you've got a few other options to make it fun for you to you. I mean, I saw you playing the HWG guy and that's like you can go in there and you have a medic on your back now that makes it even."
1444.86,1452.86," Um, so he's, the HWG is even, you know, that was part of my thing is I was concerned with the balance of this. Like is this like fat piece of crap too powerful?"
1452.86,1462.86," Because he was known, you know, in non PC terms is the wheelchair ramp to team fortress classic and now he's definitely the wheelchair elevator and he's like, um,"
1462.86,1472.86, But the thing is with him now is that he gets to extra health before the engine part of the balance they had an electromagnetic pulse grenade and the way that it worked is it would detonate all ammunition that you had stored on yourself.
1472.86,1478.86," Had he weapons guy, of course, carried the most ammunition for that big massive gun. So you hit that piece of crap with one of those."
1478.86,1490.86," Yeah, say what spite was like, this is from the old game where every time you'd see one you'd grow and you like, dude, who is playing that? You got to be so dumb. Now, now I'm over because there's so many classes that are the balance is just a different."
1490.86,1496.86," But so again, you didn't hit him with that that would blow him up if you're medic or scout. You could hit him with concussion grenade and it throws aim off."
1496.86,1503.86, But now you can snipe him in the head anywhere else is not going to do it if he's got a medic. He's not going to do anything.
1503.86,1508.86, It's up in the enhance your max damage score for your achievements.
1509.86,1524.86," And other than that, I mean, you have to approach him differently. You can bomb Bardem with, I mean, if you're demo man, you can bomb Bardem soldier, you can scout if you catch an H-dub on his own. You can run circles around him, club in a moment with your club."
1524.86,1527.86," But it's, yeah, I don't find him in vulnerable to. I mean, I'm not invulnerable."
1527.86,1533.86," Yeah, I mean, when I see one on the other team, I'm not like, oh God, I mean, you can take these guys down."
1533.86,1540.86," Rory was laughing at you though, remember, he was beating you over the head with, uh, with this scout and his little bat and you were the H-dub."
1540.86,1549.86," And he was laughing because we're trying to, uh, instead of turning around and then spinning your gun, you were spinning your gun up and then trying to turn afterward."
1549.86,1558.86," Yeah, I was. So you were like, the world's slowest tank turret. Okay, well, laughing at me is like, you know, laughing at the retarding."
1558.86,1567.86," You know, I stink. You can't fit me. You can not, I said I mentioned the banana riders, but that's like what when we first started playing, that's our ydeze."
1567.86,1579.86," Yeah, when we first started playing everyone on our team friend's list or am I, you know, did I could get in the server and boom, they'll appear within seconds. You'll see they join the server."
1579.86,1583.86," You're that popular. Well, no, just, this is the nature of the banana riding."
1583.86,1587.86," Yeah, so they're, they're, quit saying that you're making me uncomfortable."
1587.86,1597.86," You're all quiet. Um, let's just straight up turn. I'm not trying to make you laugh with the duck. That's what this is. So, um, they would come in and then they all be like a medic for you and hook you up."
1597.86,1598.86, Right.
1598.86,1603.86," And I was trying to tell you when you played, see the people in the server didn't know you were in the game because they don't know your steam tag."
1603.86,1604.86, Yeah.
1604.86,1609.86," There was however one of the banana riders steam tag is Jeff, F-T-W or Jeff for the win."
1609.86,1613.86, Yeah. And they all thought you were him. So he was getting the benefit of that. But I made myself.
1613.86,1618.86," And they were like, you know, give us your sexy voice, Jeff, give us your sexy voice."
1618.86,1622.86, Like to this guy. And they continue to do so.
1622.86,1623.86, That's funny.
1623.86,1624.86, Yeah. So you got it.
1624.86,1630.86," I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I don't mind saying mine, my, my, my tag is do face. That's why I'm there."
1630.86,1634.86, People can figure out spell it. Yeah.
1635.86,1637.86, But I love this game so far.
1637.86,1644.86," If, if the other two parts of Orange Box are as good as this, that is going to be a solid contender."
1644.86,1648.86," Does that, would that count as one game for like a game in the year thing?"
1648.86,1652.86," I guess it was. Well, I guess the Orange Box would have to count as a game of a product of the year maybe."
1652.86,1659.86," Yeah. That's a big thing. The difference between a very happy that, you know, at GFW, we review or I reviewed each one of these games separately."
1659.86,1663.86," And for me, that's the difference between reviewing a product and reviewing games."
1663.86,1667.86," And I know games are a product, but they're also something else."
1667.86,1672.86," And it's that saying, you know, if you look at it all one, you're saying, hey, my job is to tell people if this is a value."
1672.86,1680.86," And all the debates about whether you know are these games, not these games, but I mean, our is any game is that enough content for the price is charging."
1680.86,1688.86," Should it have been more, or should it have been less, all that stuff? I mean, whatever. Like, I, I don't feel like compelled to do that because I know everyone else does it."
1688.86,1698.86," Right. Going to an EB, I mean, anyone, anyone in the message boards, you know, that's all people are talking about. So in some of the, so it's going to matter the price is going to matter sometimes."
1698.86,1711.86," Like a shadow right. And in a few cases, it will. I mean, I'm not saying the price is irrelevant. Yeah, but it's like, I mean, these are, each of these games is very distinct and is an entire game in and of itself."
1712.86,1724.86," And you can look at them. I don't object to looking at them together as being in this case. I think it makes sense because they all come from the same developer and they all, you know, with different branches of that developer."
1724.86,1737.86," But they, they're together. They're indicative of what that company's about right now, what they're trying to do and there are certain themes you define them in portal and half life too. They're actually, you know, linked with narrative."
1737.86,1743.86," But so I don't object to that, but just the whole, like, is this, you know, just the value, uh,"
1743.86,1750.86," Prospect of the whole, whatever, you know, is portal linked directly to episode two in terms of narrative or just the half life universe."
1750.86,1760.86," I'm not going to give spoilers away, but let's just say the games are connected in some way. Okay. In a way, in a way that, yeah, we'll get people very excited."
1760.86,1764.86, I keep hearing great things about portal. It's awesome.
1764.86,1771.86," I'm so good. I have to come over. We're going to go into this now and come back to team for just later because we have like, to just it's a great time again."
1771.86,1778.86," Oh, alright. So soon. But, um, oh, even on that, just general, like this whole week, I have to say,"
1778.86,1787.86," having played, you know, episode two portal this, um, I can't talk about them, but I'm in the beta for crisis multiplayer front lines, of course, posing front system playing."
1787.86,1798.86," And now and then, you know, as a gamer, you hit these points for your, like, God, and it just is kind of a bummer when you don't have that one game that makes you want to play as soon as you look at your computer and you're like,"
1798.86,1806.86," you know, or as soon as you talk about it to a friend, like after this, we're going to all want to go home and play TF2 tonight. The whole time I wrote the review, every like hour out,"
1806.86,1812.86," all tab and into the game and go play some more. At that point, I know I don't know how I felt like I needed specific reference. It wasn't like fact check."
1812.86,1818.86," It was just because like, I would write about it and be like, yeah, yeah, I got to go do that again. Yeah, that's awesome."
1818.86,1827.86," And, but it's a great, like, I, I, I love that feeling when you know, when you're going to bed and you're thinking about a game, I mean, it's obsessive, but in you wake up and you're like,"
1827.86,1836.86," oh, this is cool and you're kind of like my day is good because you know, in your outline for yourself when you wake up is this a day to be excited about or is it not, and you've got like all these other things that you can add in there"
1836.86,1844.86," and the games are just one small part of it, but it, it's also cool. And sometimes you get a day for like the overnight, you've like, dude, new comics came out today."
1844.86,1854.86," It was a new episode of Lost On Tonight. I just got fucking TF2 girlfriend's coming to visit whatever else you add to their team, making you dinner, you're going out to dinner."
1854.86,1860.86," But it's definitely like one of those weeks now. Like back in, like, this is red. Like there's game, I love gaming right now."
1860.86,1863.86," There's, yeah, there's stuff that's so great to sign up."
1863.86,1867.86," Yeah, you keep looking at the release list for the rest of this year. I'm like, holy crap."
1867.86,1872.86," Yeah, it's crazy. I'm going to be emotionally unavailable for the next like two months."
1872.86,1882.86," Yeah, my wife and the kid on Sunday, we're going to go away the entire day, you know, and I knew this for a few days coming up and my wife got going,"
1882.86,1887.86," Are you sure it's okay? Because you know, you're going to be alone. And I was, oh, no, no, I'll be okay."
1887.86,1893.86," And the whole time I was like, yes, I'm, I did do it for like nine, forty five a.m."
1893.86,1898.86," I'm, because they're out of the house already. I was like marathon in front of the screen properly."
1898.86,1908.86," And then, you know, Saturday, he's like, hey, good news. Well, Sarah, my daughter, she's, she's going off to the thing and they, it turns out they don't need any more adults. So, so I'm going to be home with you today."
1908.86,1911.86, That explains wondering how to raise a little bit to play a lot.
1911.86,1916.86," No, no, well, but she was home. So, oh, that's great honey. Great news apparently."
1916.86,1919.86," So we, let's spend the day together."
1919.86,1921.86, And I'll be on the computer.
1921.86,1923.86, Go on to join our kids.
1924.86,1927.86," Oh, I'm, we've been married a long time. I can say this."
1927.86,1929.86," Love you, honey. The trouble now."
1929.86,1931.86," And you tell me, you want to go away though, that's cool."
1931.86,1935.86," So these, like, even to give to a loan is so much fun."
1935.86,1942.86," And it has every indication of being that way for a long time to come that now, you have,"
1942.86,1945.86," at first, it's like, there's, it's not an either or, you know, are you going to be playing you,"
1945.86,1947.86," we three, you're going to be playing crisis multiplayer,"
1948.86,1954.86," yeah, it's like, you know, where the two of them are as good as team fortress two."
1954.86,1957.86," Yeah, it's really, it's a bounty."
1957.86,1961.86," They needed to come out sooner. I mean, a lot of these did Quake Wars needed to come out sooner."
1961.86,1962.86," Fortress, yeah, I did."
1962.86,1969.86," I got a question to my mailbox that I will throw out there to you and anyone who may know,"
1970.86,1976.86, asking about the new friendly factor of TF2 versus Quake Wars.
1976.86,1979.86, Hmm. What's the question?
1979.86,1982.86," Well, it's a way, which would be better for a new,"
1982.86,1984.86, and a multi-player.
1984.86,1985.86, Team fortress all the way.
1985.86,1987.86," The note question about, really?"
1987.86,1988.86, It's a lot of fun.
1988.86,1992.86," Fewer objectives, fewer things to focus on is just kind of like, be a medic."
1992.86,1993.86," I thought, I guess."
1993.86,1997.86," I was tempted to say the opposite because I thought that there, you know,"
1997.86,2000.86," what I just remember from playing early on with Quake Wars,"
2000.86,2003.86," that there were support class things that you could really do,"
2003.86,2006.86," like, behind the scenes, like, back on the base and things."
2006.86,2009.86," Like, you didn't have to get your ass out there on the front line as much."
2009.86,2013.86," Yeah, maybe it gives just my bias thing that whoever do that."
2013.86,2017.86," Like, even if you, I mean, you're talking about just sitting right in your back base."
2017.86,2019.86," Well, there's a difference between pretty much."
2019.86,2020.86, You'd have to get it in that way.
2020.86,2022.86, You want to play kind of what I did.
2022.86,2026.86," The reason, like, you want to play a medic or whatever an engineer is so,"
2026.86,2031.86," yeah, and get out there in a fashion that isn't necessarily like on the direct front line,"
2031.86,2033.86," I've learned, like, right behind them."
2033.86,2034.86, I see.
2034.86,2036.86, That's how that's the reason I would want to do that.
2036.86,2038.86, So you don't actually sit in the first spawn point.
2038.86,2042.86," I think, like, I'd be like, how are we going to get this in?"
2042.86,2044.86," And then, like, when you're in, how would you like,"
2044.86,2046.86," yeah, go guys."
2046.86,2048.8599999999997, You did great.
2048.8599999999997,2050.8599999999997," You just got to worry about when someone, when someone,"
2050.8599999999997,2053.8599999999997," your teammates is dead and they're like cycling through the players,"
2053.86,2056.86, and they see you just kind of squatting there in the corner.
2056.86,2059.86," You know, quick, or just got just lots of weird nuances."
2059.86,2064.86," It's got vehicles that are, like, not necessarily intuitive right when you walk into them."
2064.86,2069.86," So, yeah, it really does go out of its way to teach people how to play it into a system,"
2069.86,2073.86, but the only reason it has to do that is because it's so complex in the first place.
2073.86,2074.86, Yeah.
2074.86,2076.86," But on the other hand, I guess if someone really wanted to ramp up on it,"
2076.86,2079.86," they could play against the bots and chill until they felt comfortable against the,"
2079.86,2080.86," you know, learning all the nuances of it."
2080.86,2082.86," You have to, does like the bots."
2082.86,2084.86," I guess you could just create a private server, right?"
2084.86,2086.86, And just follow you on a new round by yourself.
2086.86,2088.86, And you can just follow the red arrow down to the next spot.
2088.86,2089.86, Yeah.
2089.86,2090.86, Yeah.
2090.86,2094.86," And TF2 does have the great, just, just the simplistic, you know,"
2094.86,2098.86," here's where to go next thing, what's a built-in through the environment at a non-cheasy way."
2098.86,2101.86," You know, just follow the red arrow down to the next spot."
2101.86,2103.86," You know, it's so nice when you don't know."
2103.86,2104.86," When you don't know,"
2104.86,2105.86," Yeah, capture point."
2105.86,2106.86," I mean, why not?"
2106.86,2108.86, They made the whole thing a cartoon anyway.
2108.86,2109.86, Yeah.
2109.86,2111.86," And so, what's something about it, too, is that because,"
2111.86,2114.86," in most cases, the capture point, you know,"
2114.86,2117.86," actually, in a few specific cases,"
2117.86,2121.86," capture points go in an order or if they're staggered out,"
2121.86,2124.86, it's not quite like a battlefield thing where there's a bunch of stuff everywhere.
2124.86,2125.86, Yeah.
2125.86,2128.86," But then unlike Quake Wars where it's all or nothing where once you gain territory,"
2128.86,2129.86," you can't lose it again,"
2129.86,2133.86," and you sort of progress through the pseudo narrative of the level that, like,"
2133.86,2136.86," you know, take the shields down, get in the bunker, destroy this that,"
2136.86,2138.86," you know, comparison I made their view."
2138.86,2140.86," And it's always been the case for the game,"
2140.86,2142.86," you know, even a team fortress and team fortress classic,"
2142.86,2144.86, it's very much like football.
2144.86,2146.86," And the vibe you get where,"
2146.86,2150.86," and because of that, it's also a game where you die a whole whole lot."
2150.86,2152.86," But it should, it's not as frustrating in there,"
2152.86,2154.86," because if you're, if you're at the line of scrimmage in this game,"
2154.86,2157.86," and you're going up in the team that's getting pushed back,"
2157.86,2159.86," has got turrets and heavy weapon to guys and stuff,"
2159.86,2161.86," and you're trying to break that stalemate,"
2161.86,2162.86," you're going to go up there,"
2162.86,2164.86," and it's pretty much like the alignment,"
2164.86,2166.86," all like big mashup, you know,"
2166.86,2168.86," and you could be one of those,"
2168.86,2169.86," and that's rewarding in some way,"
2169.86,2172.86," or you can be one of the classes that's equivalent of a wide receiver,"
2172.86,2173.86," try to get through,"
2173.86,2174.86," or you know,"
2174.86,2176.86," be in the backfield and do your thing there too,"
2176.86,2178.86," if you want, isn't engineer."
2178.86,2179.86," And it's,"
2179.86,2181.86," just because it's like football doesn't mean it's good,"
2181.86,2183.86, but it's very unique though in that respect.
2183.86,2186.86," The flow of the matches in this game are very unique,"
2186.86,2188.86," and they're pretty much,"
2188.86,2191.86," that's true, it's a big one all the time too."
2191.86,2193.86, It seems much more gentle.
2193.86,2195.86, You're back in the game pretty quickly.
2195.86,2198.86," There's not that big a penalty for dying, you know?"
2198.86,2201.86," Yeah, you'd be surprised to know that it's a bigger penalty"
2201.86,2202.86," than ever before in the game,"
2202.86,2203.86, but it's really?
2203.86,2204.86," Yeah, I mean,"
2204.86,2206.86, it doesn't feel that punitive.
2206.86,2208.86," You don't put it to what 20 seconds sometimes, right?"
2208.86,2209.86, You can't wait to get that.
2209.86,2210.86," Yeah, 20 is about right?"
2210.86,2213.86," The way that that works again is based on balancing,"
2213.86,2215.86," so in proximity to,"
2215.86,2217.86," you know, like say for example,"
2217.86,2218.86," in the same way that like, you know,"
2218.86,2219.86," in well,"
2219.86,2223.86," the final capture point on either side turns over to the other team,"
2223.86,2225.86," very, very rapidly,"
2225.86,2227.86, and that's because it's in such close proximity
2227.86,2228.86," to your spawn,"
2228.86,2230.86," to your spawn cabinet,"
2230.86,2233.86, or spawn room or whatever.
2233.86,2234.86," But yeah, I mean,"
2234.86,2236.86," sometimes it's just the way it works,"
2236.86,2237.86," so it's definitely not like counter strike,"
2237.86,2240.86, at least you're not watching a whole match.
2240.86,2241.86, That's what I remember.
2241.86,2242.86, Yeah.
2242.86,2243.86," Respond,"
2243.86,2244.86, Ged.
2244.86,2245.86," Yeah, that's not fun."
2245.86,2247.86, That's the game that's just brutal learned.
2247.86,2248.86," You're supposed to go in and learn,"
2248.86,2249.86," but like,"
2249.86,2250.86," here I am, boom,"
2250.86,2251.86, there I go.
2251.86,2252.86," Yeah, it's impossible."
2252.86,2255.86, And then the guys running around for another three minutes or so.
2255.86,2256.86, Yeah.
2256.86,2257.86, Chatter-run did that too.
2257.86,2259.86," Long, we started to,"
2259.86,2261.86, to talk about portal.
2261.86,2262.86, Just a little bit.
2262.86,2263.86, Yeah.
2263.86,2264.86," To, on the you've played it though."
2264.86,2265.86, Yeah.
2265.86,2266.86," Yeah, how can we do anything about it?"
2266.86,2268.86," Well, how can we use a spoiler free discussion on it?"
2268.86,2269.86, Yeah.
2269.86,2272.86," I can just say a few things about it, then."
2272.86,2273.86," Um,"
2273.86,2274.86," in that,"
2274.86,2276.86," going into that game,"
2276.86,2278.86," that was the last one when I played through these,"
2278.86,2280.86," that I was like, I'll just save this for last."
2280.86,2281.86," Like, it looks cool."
2281.86,2282.86, The idea of the puzzle.
2282.86,2285.86," I mean, the game makes behind the puzzles great."
2285.86,2287.86," But at the end of the day,"
2287.86,2288.86," I'm like, it's a puzzle game."
2288.86,2289.86, I'm going to be doing a much puzzles.
2289.86,2290.86," And I'm going to have to be,"
2290.86,2293.86, is this one puzzle too much for a straight playthrough session.
2293.86,2294.86, Mm-hmm.
2294.86,2295.86," Um,"
2295.86,2297.86," that was very surprised to find out that,"
2297.86,2298.86," okay,"
2298.86,2300.86," traditional fashion without the,"
2300.86,2301.86," the easy win to it,"
2301.86,2302.86," you know,"
2302.86,2303.86, perfectly.
2303.86,2305.86, So you start off with the most simple.
2305.86,2307.86, Here's how the system of this game works.
2307.86,2309.86," How you're able to use your portal,"
2309.86,2312.86, and then you're just going to be on and in the set to maneuver through this environment.
2312.86,2318.86, But then it introduces just extraordinary atmosphere and extraordinary environment.
2318.86,2320.86," I'm sitting there looking at Gasmuk,"
2320.86,2321.86," I don't know how to need a monologue on this,"
2321.86,2322.86, but it is fucking damn cool.
2322.86,2323.86," You read, you read,"
2323.86,2325.86, you read there of your road on the wall.
2325.86,2326.86," Yeah, now I've heard nothing."
2326.86,2327.86, Good things about it.
2327.86,2328.86," And I believe that,"
2328.86,2329.86," uh,"
2329.86,2330.86," Eric and Chad,"
2330.86,2331.86," um,"
2331.86,2332.86," from the,"
2332.86,2333.86," the old,"
2333.86,2336.86, great old man Murray site that did a lot of the story.
2336.86,2337.86," Yeah,"
2337.86,2338.86, and the dialogues.
2338.86,2340.86, I'm one of the funniest games that I've ever had.
2340.86,2341.86, And there you go.
2341.86,2342.86, Yeah.
2342.86,2343.86, Yeah.
2343.86,2344.86, They did some awesome stuff on it.
2344.86,2346.86, Give you some examples on that.
2346.86,2347.86," Uh,"
2347.86,2348.86," turrets, for example,"
2348.86,2349.86, we'll talk to you.
2349.86,2351.86," They have this quite childlike,"
2351.86,2352.86," you know, voice,"
2352.86,2353.86," of course,"
2353.86,2354.86, it's distorted.
2354.86,2355.86," And they'll be like,"
2355.86,2356.86, where did you go?
2356.86,2357.86," I see you or like,"
2357.86,2358.86, come back here.
2358.86,2359.86," I need to kill you or whatever,"
2359.86,2360.86," you know what,"
2360.86,2361.86," but not kill you because it's like,"
2361.86,2362.86," it gives them with identity,"
2362.86,2363.86, but they're not aware.
2363.86,2365.86," It's kind of like the big lug,"
2365.86,2366.86," the big,"
2366.86,2367.86," the big lug who,"
2367.86,2369.86, the term was sweetly or tart.
2369.86,2370.86," Uh,"
2370.86,2372.86, where you could be as opposed to wife.
2372.86,2373.86," You know,"
2373.86,2374.86," but I mean,"
2374.86,2375.86, it's capable of her.
2375.86,2376.86, Okay.
2376.86,2377.86, It's a good one.
2377.86,2378.86," My son men, you know,"
2378.86,2379.86," like,"
2379.86,2380.86, basically the turrets are a lanyan.
2380.86,2381.86, You're the rabbit.
2381.86,2382.86, You've had a couple of those.
2382.86,2383.86," Like,"
2383.86,2385.86, EGMs had a couple interns that were like that.
2385.86,2387.86, You should.
2387.86,2389.86," So,"
2389.86,2391.86," um,"
2391.86,2393.86, I'm sitting there trying to think of who.
2393.86,2394.86, Oh.
2395.86,2398.86, So they're like that and they're talking with you and playing with you.
2398.86,2399.86," The thing is with this is like,"
2399.86,2400.86," without saying just how,"
2400.86,2402.86, how much of it.
2402.86,2406.86, Giving you an idea of how funny it is without spoiling too much.
2406.86,2407.86, Maybe I'll just let it wait on that one.
2407.86,2408.86," I do,"
2408.86,2409.86," I heard that they do a nice,"
2409.86,2410.86," uh,"
2410.86,2411.86," crate,"
2411.86,2412.86, crate joke.
2412.86,2413.86, Okay.
2413.86,2414.86," Because they're,"
2414.86,2415.86," they're the originators of the,"
2415.86,2416.86," uh,"
2416.86,2417.86, time to crate.
2417.86,2418.86, Right.
2418.86,2419.86," As, as,"
2419.86,2420.86," as you know already,"
2420.86,2421.86," the game in the game,"
2421.86,2423.86, your test subject of some sort.
2423.86,2425.86, You've seen that much before and I'll previews.
2425.86,2428.86, We've known that you're the equivalent of some sort of lab rat.
2428.86,2431.86," So just know that with that situation there,"
2431.86,2433.86," and with talented writers behind that,"
2433.86,2435.86," and all the things they're going to do,"
2435.86,2437.86," keeping in mind that,"
2437.86,2438.86," um,"
2438.86,2439.86," that'll also,"
2439.86,2440.86," you know,"
2440.86,2441.86, is able to track your performance in game.
2441.86,2444.86, So they know how long a specific puzzle takes you and stuff.
2444.86,2446.86," That adds just this extra level of,"
2446.86,2448.86," of fun to the whole thing that you know that,"
2448.86,2449.86," hey,"
2449.86,2450.86," if your character who's a lab rat,"
2450.86,2451.86," takes,"
2451.86,2452.86," you know,"
2452.86,2454.86," I heard was that there's an EA executive,"
2454.86,2456.86," who took 12 hours to beat the game,"
2456.86,2457.86," which is,"
2457.86,2459.86," he's sad because I think,"
2459.86,2460.86," I, I estimated it,"
2460.86,2462.86," like just giving a rough thing for for,"
2462.86,2463.86, for most players.
2463.86,2464.86, Yeah.
2464.86,2465.86, 3 to 4 hours.
2465.86,2467.86, So EA's got that information.
2467.86,2468.86," No,"
2468.86,2469.86," not going to name,"
2469.86,2471.86," do they have spent,"
2471.86,2472.86, $100 on this one puzzle.
2472.86,2473.86, Oh man.
2473.86,2474.86," In the,"
2474.86,2475.86," Uh,"
2475.86,2477.86, because of its similarities to The No Light Jar.
2477.86,2478.86," Yeah,"
2478.86,2480.86, like an IQ test facial reasoning.
2480.86,2486.38," I mean, you need to look at the physical space and see how things are connected in ways."
2486.38,2490.2200000000003, What happens if I put a point here and exit here and it keeps me in mind?
2490.2200000000003,2491.7000000000003, I sucked at geometry.
2491.7000000000003,2494.58, Maybe you'll have a few points where you get stumped.
2494.58,2495.58, I'm not sure.
2495.58,2500.58," It grades up at a very, very, you know, even pace."
2500.58,2503.9," But most importantly though, and here's the difference is it's not that the puzzles were"
2503.9,2509.98," better than I expected, but because of the story, you want to keep playing."
2509.98,2514.38," It's definitely the reward at the end of the maze for you, you know, the incentive to go"
2514.38,2516.38, through this maze.
2516.38,2519.7," I keep, you know, keeping this wall of what to say."
2519.7,2520.94," But okay, let's go to Crate."
2520.94,2525.14, Here's an example of some of the fun earlier on.
2525.14,2528.94," The artificial intelligence that's running this whole program that you're in, it's not"
2528.94,2529.94, a program actually.
2529.94,2531.98," That's not a spoilers, you don't think that."
2531.98,2535.7400000000002," But who's not a computer program rather, but who's running the initiative."
2535.7400000000002,2537.7400000000002, Maybe like the Dharma initiative.
2537.7400000000002,2539.94, It is a kind of a lost grade.
2539.98,2540.94, Thanks for ruining it.
2540.94,2542.7400000000002," Um, you're in it."
2542.7400000000002,2544.02, It all takes place in a hatch.
2544.02,2545.02, It's a tight.
2545.02,2547.02, This is in the pearl.
2547.02,2548.02, Yeah.
2548.02,2550.02, So it's really weird.
2550.02,2552.94, It's kind of an unreliable narrator.
2552.94,2556.54," And at one point it tells you, you know, you need this Crate to help you hit these switches"
2556.54,2560.54, that will ultimately help you open doors or power various things that are going to let you
2560.54,2562.98, proceed through this puzzle.
2562.98,2566.86," You know, and it, not only gives you a Crate, but it's got hearts all over it."
2566.86,2567.86, And it's called a companion.
2567.86,2568.86, It's called a companion.
2568.86,2572.94," And it talks to you like a mother about, you know, taking great care of your companion"
2572.94,2573.94, Cube.
2573.94,2576.2200000000003," And this is, it is basically a Crate with the hard on it."
2576.2200000000003,2577.2200000000003, I don't know.
2577.2200000000003,2580.2200000000003, You're best with this thing.
2580.2200000000003,2586.7000000000003," And then, uh, behind it, okay, here's part of the picture then."
2586.7000000000003,2590.02, Eventually it tells you to put the thing in the dam and sin right or in burn it.
2590.02,2593.82," And it says it's not only that, but it's important that you're the one who does it."
2593.82,2596.86, You need to get rid of this companion Cube because you're maybe a little too attached to
2596.86,2597.7000000000003, it now.
2597.7,2599.98, And I was pretty much just fucking with you by calling it a companion Cube.
2599.98,2601.14, It's just a stupid Crate.
2601.14,2604.14," Oh, and it tells you to do that after you've gone with it."
2604.14,2605.58, But then that's not the end of the joke.
2605.58,2608.02, The game does some really great things with it there.
2608.02,2611.8599999999997," And that goes what I think might be a little bit too, too much in the spoiler territory."
2611.8599999999997,2612.8599999999997, Okay.
2612.8599999999997,2613.8599999999997, I already know too much.
2613.8599999999997,2614.8599999999997, Yeah.
2614.8599999999997,2615.8599999999997, Thanks.
2615.8599999999997,2616.8599999999997, I get Ryan wasn't planning on playing it.
2616.8599999999997,2618.66, So I gave him the full breakdown this morning.
2618.66,2622.7, And that's probably why like that might have been my rehearsal for like describing the game.
2622.7,2624.54, The problem is that was no holds barred in it.
2624.54,2628.7799999999997," So it was very, very easy to start from A and move on through."
2628.7799999999997,2631.1, But the look for it to it.
2631.1,2635.1, I think I will say this that it is going to be one of those games that's talked about
2635.1,2641.22," for a long time to come for it's humor for the, you know, the subtlety of some of the"
2641.22,2642.22, things it does.
2642.22,2647.82," And ultimately though, for saying, for proving that the three hour game is like completely"
2647.82,2651.74," creatively viable that you don't play it and say, well, that feels like a rip off."
2651.74,2654.5, That's why that's why I think you know when I was bringing up this whole like literally
2654.5,2658.94," sitting argue about whether or not this is much, this is too much money or enough for this."
2658.94,2659.94, Yeah.
2659.94,2662.82, It's like let the game decide like this game is is awesome.
2662.82,2665.42," Like when you play it, you're like that that is satisfied."
2665.42,2668.5," If it had gone, this has been eight hours of these puzzles, sure, I would have probably"
2668.5,2670.42," got tired of it, you know."
2670.42,2672.22, But that was my reaction to it.
2672.22,2675.3, It's like the first cat of Marty was that way for me.
2675.3,2676.3, Yeah.
2676.3,2677.46, I don't know if it would still.
2677.46,2683.5," But the first time when that whole concept was was so novel, I beat that game real fast."
2683.5,2688.94, And I bought it and it was totally worth it to me just to try a new gaming experience
2688.94,2689.94, like that.
2689.94,2692.38, And if you ripped off it all.
2692.38,2697.3," And they, yeah, I mean, I think I don't know, you know, I say create a viability as opposed"
2697.3,2699.26," to you know, financial, you know, market viability."
2699.26,2703.5, I hope that the latter proves to be the case also.
2703.5,2708.46," That clearly didn't believe that to be the case on consoles because they don't, they're"
2708.46,2710.98, releasing the game as this big value box.
2711.06,2712.86, Not as individual things.
2712.86,2717.66," Some of that on Xbox, at least, might be them not agreeing to the conditions of live or"
2717.66,2719.7400000000002, live or the other way around.
2719.7400000000002,2724.22," Live saying, hey, this is shit's too big or right, it's not enough to be a full game."
2724.22,2725.78," And it's not, it's too big to be a mini game."
2725.78,2727.06, We don't want this on in this form.
2727.06,2728.06," Yeah, something."
2728.06,2729.78, But these are awesome.
2729.78,2733.46," And it really makes you ask like, why the hell are games?"
2733.46,2737.94," The way that we, you know, the lengths that we know that they are and, you know, in an"
2737.94,2739.5, experience of this sort.
2740.1,2744.42," Because there's less to it, I mean, they obviously save money, you know, generating assets"
2744.42,2745.98, and stuff by this sort of thing.
2745.98,2749.78," But now that you have, you know, the option for, you know, digital distribution or I mean,"
2749.78,2751.66, you could just sell these things in the store.
2751.66,2755.54, God knows her burning a DVD does not cost much for production.
2755.54,2757.94, And I would love a bunch more games like this.
2757.94,2761.26," I mean, it is definitely one of my favorite experiences of the year."
2761.26,2764.58, And I can't wait to see more games.
2764.58,2769.1," I get, yeah, I mean, why shouldn't there be games across 10 bucks at the store?"
2769.74,2772.1, Five bucks 15 bucks.
2772.1,2776.9, I wish more developers would just be not afraid to make a shorter game sometimes.
2776.9,2779.14, So many games that I love.
2779.14,2782.54," Yeah, like their section in terms of like, you could, you could have had, you know,"
2782.54,2784.02," yeah, like, yeah."
2784.02,2787.5," But we look at again, we look, it's the damn we look at him as products, you know,"
2787.5,2789.34," and people say, oh, wasn't long enough."
2789.34,2791.54, And it was it like enough for the value and stuff.
2791.54,2795.02," Wasn't like, was this game for what this game wants to accomplish?"
2795.02,2796.58, Was it just the right length?
2796.58,2797.94, Was it too long or too short?
2797.94,2802.7400000000002," And a lot of games I think are too long because it's, you know, the, this is what"
2802.7400000000002,2804.82, Valve wanted to do with the episodes from the beginning.
2804.82,2806.26, This was the most important part of it.
2806.26,2809.5," And I believe this, this is what they were saying at the beginning."
2809.5,2810.5, I now believe them.
2810.5,2813.66," They weren't like, hey, it's not about micro chunking the shit and making money off"
2813.66,2818.5," recycling, cannibalizing our own stuff and giving you like, basically the equivalent of"
2818.5,2821.7000000000003," remixes, you know, episodes and stuff like that."
2821.7000000000003,2825.86, But this is because for the reasons that we just explained that gaming doesn't have short
2825.94,2831.58," stories or novellas and all these other forms, it's got basically the equivalent of a serial,"
2831.58,2836.94," you know, TV show or something like that, but I mean, but all it wants, like a box set,"
2836.94,2839.06," where, but you're expected to do the whole thing at once."
2839.06,2840.7400000000002," I guess that would, that would be closer."
2840.7400000000002,2844.6600000000003, I don't want to say movie because you can watch a movie in three hours or something.
2844.6600000000003,2849.2200000000003," And it's, and, and when movies are made, the question is always, how much of this can"
2849.2200000000003,2851.6600000000003, we cut out and still have the movie we want to make?
2851.6600000000003,2854.54," You know, it's never like with most games that we're used to."
2854.54,2859.82," But how much shit can we, can we put into this game, to until we hit the 10 hour marker,"
2859.82,2863.3," the eight hour marker, whatever the market is, you know, how can we take the levels we've"
2863.3,2868.1," already made and run you back through the damn things and, you know, over and over again,"
2868.1,2869.54, until we hit that mark.
2869.54,2875.38," And what happens now and what's valuable saying is, without that constraint, we can make"
2875.38,2879.22, a game where every single thing in here is there because we're completely satisfied with
2879.22,2882.7," the way it turned out because it's there because someone had an idea and pitched in and said,"
2882.7,2887.02," hey, there's very good reason for this to be in this game and the way the collaborative"
2887.02,2888.02, process works.
2888.02,2891.7799999999997," And instead, you get these games where, you know, you want to play them straight through,"
2891.7799999999997,2893.7799999999997, I did that with episode two as well.
2893.7799999999997,2897.3399999999997," And when you're done, the whole thing sits in your mind, the whole experience front to"
2897.3399999999997,2901.4199999999996," back, you can point out any specific moment and talk about that instead of just so remember"
2901.4199999999996,2904.98," this level and it's kind of fuzzy in between there and stuff, you know, or even debate"
2904.98,2907.46," and is that the one with the gray walls or is that the one with the green walls, you"
2907.46,2909.8199999999997," know, and they just nailed it."
2909.8199999999997,2911.62," Like, I really hope to see more of that."
2911.7,2913.7, They did that even way back with Halo.
2913.7,2914.7," I'm sorry, not Halo."
2914.7,2919.74," That's like one, which was, which was a long game, but they still, I mean, they're"
2919.74,2921.54, a particularly talented group of developers.
2921.54,2922.54," Yeah, no had it designed."
2922.54,2928.1, This is a lever than let them make games on a near yearly basis rather than five year
2928.1,2929.1, basis.
2929.1,2931.7," Of course, they said at first it was going to be every three months."
2931.7,2935.14," Yeah, I don't know where that was smoking."
2935.14,2937.18," Yeah, that was a wishful thing."
2937.18,2938.18, That was on our cover.
2938.18,2939.18, That was some Ninja Gold.
2939.18,2943.2599999999998," Yeah, I didn't we say that on the cover."
2943.2599999999998,2945.2599999999998," Yeah, we have like every three months."
2945.2599999999998,2946.2599999999998, Yes.
2946.2599999999998,2947.8599999999997, But you didn't say guaranteed.
2947.8599999999997,2950.8199999999997," You're, you're maybe you're buying into your own cover cover line right?"
2950.8199999999997,2951.8199999999997, Probably.
2951.8199999999997,2952.8199999999997, Yeah.
2952.8199999999997,2954.8999999999996," What they said was, no, I write, we would like cover lines."
2954.8999999999996,2955.8999999999996, I would.
2955.8999999999996,2956.8999999999996, I would.
2956.8999999999996,2957.8999999999996, I would.
2957.8999999999996,2959.62, But with the cost of risk.
2959.62,2962.66," The comment was allowing the lines if we would like to have them, like maybe"
2962.66,2964.94, every three or four months or so.
2964.94,2965.94, Yeah.
2965.94,2966.94, And I'm sure they would like to.
2966.94,2969.14," But it wasn't like, hey, this is a really good."
2969.14,2972.66, This is exactly how it's going to shake every three.
2972.66,2978.22," It's hard to narrate those hyperbolic cover lines, you know, trying to sound magazines."
2978.22,2984.06," It's like we had the World Warcraft secrets, that's a nationwide cover line a while ago."
2984.06,2985.06, And that was a great article.
2985.06,2986.06, It was.
2986.06,2988.06, But there were no secrets.
2988.06,2989.06, We lied.
2989.06,2990.06, That's secret.
2990.06,2992.06, That was the big secret.
2992.06,2993.06, I could.
2993.06,2995.3399999999997," No, it was like interviews with the developers."
2995.3399999999997,2996.9, And there were really cool stuff in there.
2996.9,3001.46, And they said a lot about the game that people didn't know before because we did good
3001.46,3002.46, interviews.
3002.46,3003.46, So I guess those were secrets.
3003.46,3004.46," Yeah, you did."
3004.46,3005.46, You did.
3005.46,3006.46, That's not it.
3006.46,3007.46, Yeah.
3007.46,3008.46, The secret because no one has to.
3008.46,3010.46, Because no one cared.
3010.46,3011.46, Yeah.
3011.46,3012.46, Yeah.
3012.46,3014.46, And anything else to say?
3014.46,3021.62," I mean, more on and once again, episode two might be my favorite of the series."
3021.62,3022.62, That's sand a lot.
3022.62,3023.62, It is.
3023.62,3025.62, I like it more than episode one a lot.
3025.98,3028.74," More than half life one and two, the big games."
3028.74,3033.7," I like previously, it my ordering was that half like two was the best, half like"
3033.7,3035.3399999999997, two proper.
3035.3399999999997,3038.58, Now it's still again hard to compete with that.
3038.58,3042.54, And the case as I made was just because it introduced so many things.
3042.54,3043.54, Yeah.
3043.54,3044.54, It was horrible.
3044.54,3051.54," But this is a clear contender because they just, they just know how to make the kind"
3051.54,3053.7, of game they make so well now.
3053.7,3054.9399999999996, They get better with it every time.
3054.9399999999996,3059.62, But it's just like so it's every 20 minutes you're doing something different.
3059.62,3060.62, Yeah.
3060.62,3063.5, And it grade seamlessly from one activity to another.
3063.5,3066.2599999999998," You avoid that feeling of like, okay, here I'm in this world that just blast"
3066.2599999999998,3069.7799999999997, everything until like they they played me a little movie.
3069.7799999999997,3071.1, And then I go and blast some more shit.
3071.1,3073.66, I'm supposed to pretend that movie had something to do with me running around
3073.66,3075.22, blast and shit.
3075.22,3077.22, It's all part of the same thing.
3077.22,3080.62, Anytime you finish a fight or you're in the middle of a fight and you deal with another
3080.62,3083.3399999999997," character in the game, sure you can't talk with them."
3083.34,3084.34," They can talk at you, right?"
3084.34,3087.34, You can observe them talking with one another.
3087.34,3090.46, There's a dialogue tree or anything like that.
3090.46,3096.78," But you feel that this stuff is part of the, and because of that, because you might"
3096.78,3103.86, go from doing some super clever puzzle to a small encounter to a puzzle of an entirely
3103.86,3108.06, different nature to some driving to a massive encounter to some downtime with a whole
3108.06,3109.06, group of people.
3109.06,3115.14, The game's cast continues to grow both just in depth and also in breadth.
3115.14,3118.66, They're more characters that they introduce and every time they introduce like a new
3118.66,3124.22," character, you're like, I want to see more of this guy or this girl's crazy."
3124.22,3128.5," And because of it, I experience all the story as part of the game."
3128.5,3133.7799999999997," This is, I was there and I watched these people have this discussion and I did all this stuff."
3133.7799999999997,3136.82, I was an actor in the environment when this stuff happened.
3136.82,3139.7000000000003," And this for me, some people have no issues with cutscenes."
3139.7000000000003,3143.34," I mean, because it's kind of, in a way, I mean, this is more than discussion about cutscene"
3143.34,3146.5," to cutscene or not, you know, but it's part of it."
3146.5,3149.26," And for me, I can never connect the two together."
3149.26,3151.02," When I play a game, there's a cutscene."
3151.02,3155.26," It's never worked for me any, any more than it did in Pac Man when you beat three levels or"
3155.26,3159.3, whatever it was in the damn baby Pac Man gets formed or what?
3159.3,3163.06," In any game, you can't think of any cutscene that they just don't want it for you."
3163.06,3164.06, Okay.
3164.06,3167.14," Like watching sometimes, you know, in some of the classic ones, like, you know, like"
3167.14,3172.46," Devil May Cry and stuff, but like, but it's not, for me, there's just this disconnect."
3172.46,3176.9," It's kind of like, if you were trying to think of some example where it's some supplementary"
3176.9,3180.14, fiction and it's not part of what I'm doing.
3180.14,3181.58, It just doesn't work for me that way.
3181.58,3186.1, So maybe I appreciate the half life involved approach more for that kind of thing.
3186.1,3187.1, I'm trying to think if there's anything.
3187.1,3189.82," Well, what do you think of those dopey and interactive cutscenes that have these days?"
3189.82,3192.58," It's kind of like, it's almost like dragons layer when you're just like, okay."
3192.58,3198.46," So those are completely, you mean like in Engine 1, or Engine 2, like, got a god of war"
3198.46,3202.22," in the go to Prophecy and any of the stuff where you're like, instead of making you"
3202.22,3205.38," sit there and watch the game, you're actually tapping a button for no reason."
3205.38,3207.8199999999997," Yeah, they're having a straight up cutscene."
3207.8199999999997,3209.94, If they're going to have the choice between a cutscene and a cutscene.
3209.94,3210.94, It just means that cutscene.
3210.94,3211.94, We're going to have to watch it.
3211.94,3212.94, Yeah.
3212.94,3213.94, Exactly.
3213.94,3214.94, Yeah.
3214.94,3217.14," After watching it again and plus like it distracts me from what's going on, like, I'm just like,"
3217.14,3220.94," going, where is this, I did a triangle to triangle my concentrations on which button"
3220.94,3221.94, to press rather than the.
3221.94,3224.3," Yeah, and they'll know that these are very successful."
3224.3,3226.02," Yeah, a lot of people loved talking about them."
3226.02,3230.9," I mean, there was that one video from God of War 2 that people turned into an animated, you know,"
3230.9,3234.98," a gift file and it was, you know, one of the heartbeat sequences you're watching it."
3234.98,3236.86," And you're like, yeah, I remember dragons layer."
3236.86,3237.62, It's up dragons there.
3237.62,3238.62," Look, it's up there."
3238.62,3239.62, Yeah.
3239.62,3242.2200000000003, But they think it's the greatest thing ever.
3242.2200000000003,3244.62," Well, for, so it means it definitely works for some people."
3244.62,3245.94, It's a subjective thing.
3245.94,3247.3," They don't, it doesn't work for me."
3247.3,3251.18," From those are almost better to like, for the people watching than the people playing"
3251.18,3252.18, to me.
3252.18,3253.46," Yeah, someone's sitting there watching you play the game."
3253.46,3257.1, That's cooler to them almost.
3257.1,3262.2599999999998," And they tend to just prove like, I mean, you play, you play Del McCarras something you"
3262.2599999999998,3265.18," look in your God name, acrobatic ninja in the cutscene."
3265.18,3267.2999999999997," And while you're still mobile in the game, but then you look and there's like some"
3267.2999999999997,3268.94," tiny, that's wall you can't jump over."
3268.94,3271.4199999999996," Maybe that was a bad example, but we all know some game."
3271.4199999999996,3272.4199999999996," Yeah, that's true."
3272.4199999999996,3273.4199999999996," Yeah, right."
3273.4199999999996,3277.94," Yeah, the identity that they're trying to picture their painting the cutscene is like,"
3277.94,3278.94, entirely detached from the game.
3278.94,3280.3399999999997," You're like, okay, well, that's great."
3280.34,3285.26, Why can't it jump over their stupid fucking tire?
3285.26,3286.26, So that was there.
3286.26,3291.5, But that's the other thing is that they have like two episodes to and portal or both
3291.5,3292.5, along those lines.
3292.5,3299.46, They're very much like movies for me and that they are going from scene to scene.
3299.46,3303.58," And there's, you know, when you make a movie or you write a short story or novel or something,"
3303.58,3308.3," you pay attention to the pacing of the whole, how all the parts fit together and how, you"
3308.3,3311.0600000000004," know, what happens when you look at the entire thing."
3311.0600000000004,3314.1800000000003," But I mean, when you have, I mean, most games are so big now."
3314.1800000000003,3316.3, You have different teams designing different levels.
3316.3,3319.7400000000002," And that I'm sure happens about two, but I mean, I don't know if it's there's not enough"
3319.7400000000002,3323.5," oversight or what, but I mean, you know, even like Medal of Honor or something, you know,"
3323.5,3324.5, like there's five levels.
3324.5,3328.5, Like it could have been a bunch of different teams that made each of the different ones.
3328.5,3329.5, And they're just there.
3329.5,3331.1800000000003," There's nothing, there's nothing between them."
3331.1800000000003,3334.7400000000002," I mean, there's like, oh, I don't know."
3334.74,3338.9799999999996," I, I'm, I'm very, I'm still, I got a huge glow factor from having playing those games."
3338.9799999999996,3341.02, I came back and I just wanted to talk to about him.
3341.02,3342.02, I wanted to.
3342.02,3343.8199999999997, You just have that because you got to play it first.
3343.8199999999997,3344.8199999999997, That's definitely why.
3344.8199999999997,3346.8199999999997," That's what we started his review, too."
3346.8199999999997,3347.8199999999997, Yeah.
3347.8199999999997,3348.8199999999997, I was the first.
3348.8199999999997,3349.8199999999997, Yeah.
3349.8199999999997,3354.8199999999997," First journal, some of the American fields to be the first person to imagine how you were"
3354.8199999999997,3356.9799999999996, about me having played it.
3356.9799999999996,3358.8199999999997," And you didn't, yeah, yeah, yeah."
3358.8199999999997,3361.4199999999996," No, but actually, I did have one question."
3361.4199999999996,3364.18," So last week, you, you said it as an email, like right after you finished playing it,"
3364.2599999999998,3366.7799999999997, you liked it better than bio-shock?
3366.7799999999997,3372.02," I don't know, but when I finished it, I was asking myself, I said to myself, too, I don't know"
3372.02,3374.06, if I like this more or not.
3374.06,3377.4199999999996," And that was all, I didn't even really need the question it further, because I don't really care."
3377.4199999999996,3378.4199999999996, Right.
3378.4199999999996,3379.4199999999996, That just made it a lot more.
3379.4199999999996,3380.62," Yeah, it's like, it's like, yeah, that problem."
3380.62,3382.4199999999996," In fact, yeah, for sure."
3382.4199999999996,3387.4199999999996," It was, and Bosch, speaking of lying, because I actually didn't finish it, but I"
3387.4199999999996,3391.06, I found out for Mr. Milo here that I guess I'm on the end boss now.
3391.14,3396.86," And I was surprised, actually, that it turns out that that was the end, and yet not disappointed."
3396.86,3399.86," Like, I feel like that was enough bio-shock."
3399.86,3401.2599999999998," Yeah, there was a good length."
3401.2599999999998,3406.94," Some people have heard criticize that it was actually too long, that after seeing a certain key event,"
3406.94,3408.1, they felt like it dragged down.
3408.1,3409.58, More than one person I heard say that.
3409.58,3412.58," Oh, after the kind of twist, I don't agree."
3412.58,3413.58, Yeah.
3413.58,3415.2599999999998, I think it actually worked pretty well.
3415.2599999999998,3417.58," I remember being when I got to, you know, that point."
3417.58,3419.94," Yeah, I was going, oh, I hope this isn't over yet."
3419.94,3422.7000000000003, I remember just to get out of the hat because I thought it was.
3422.7000000000003,3426.86," I mean, it wasn't like going back to, you know, Halo One or something, you know, something"
3426.86,3429.42," we're going to talk about later, but I mean, like, in the original, hello, and you have"
3429.42,3430.42, to go through the library.
3430.42,3431.42, Right.
3431.42,3434.54," I mean, like, that was an obvious case where they were trying to stretch out the gameplay"
3434.54,3435.54, time.
3435.54,3439.66," Well, I also hope to when I was playing Bosch, and you hit that point with Andrew Ryan,"
3439.66,3443.2200000000003, that that wasn't going to end up being the first third.
3443.2200000000003,3447.86," Like, when it turned out that wasn't the end, I was also hoping I was at least at the"
3447.86,3448.86, halfway point.
3448.86,3452.46," Because I felt like I was getting, like, let's move it on here."
3452.46,3456.42," See, and in fact, they did with with have when I played Half Life in Portal, I didn't"
3456.42,3459.02," even think about length, which is part of the thing."
3459.02,3463.2200000000003," You know, I've never was like, yeah, but you know, I wasn't playing long enough to say,"
3463.2200000000003,3466.06," because I think when you ask yourself, like, yeah, I wonder how much left there is."
3466.06,3467.38," You're starting your, yeah, you are."
3467.38,3468.38, You're right.
3468.38,3471.1800000000003," And maybe not in the long run, but at least for that specific session, you're probably"
3471.1800000000003,3475.3," doing the point where you're, you're, you're ruining the game for yourself or you're"
3475.3,3478.7400000000002, diminishing the enjoyment you could get from it by not turning off and playing it.
3478.74,3483.62," The next day, yeah, other than just dragging your session on, I do know that's my experience"
3483.62,3484.62, in general.
3484.62,3490.18," I think with every, every entry in Half Life series, it's always just been totally fun."
3490.18,3492.8199999999997, I've never felt like I wish they would move on.
3492.8199999999997,3493.8199999999997, Right.
3493.8199999999997,3495.18, They've always been so greatly pissed.
3495.18,3497.8999999999996," Well, I was just an interesting point because you just mentioned that there comes"
3497.8999999999996,3499.74, that point when you play a game when you've to turn it off.
3499.74,3500.74, Yeah.
3500.74,3503.2599999999998," And here, you were sitting in a room for three days playing these three different games,"
3503.2599999999998,3504.2599999999998, right?
3504.2599999999998,3507.7," But it took a lot, I mean, I mean, I said, it was three hours for one."
3507.7,3510.18," The other, I'm, I'm play these games pretty quickly."
3510.18,3511.74, So it was about five hours for other.
3511.74,3514.9399999999996," But then I was able, because of that line, you're able to go and play them again."
3514.9399999999996,3516.9399999999996, They have commentary mode to support that.
3516.9399999999996,3517.9399999999996, Right.
3517.9399999999996,3520.46," And also just to, you know, like in a way, you had a great short story."
3520.46,3523.5," Like how many times, I mean, thinking your favorite short story, how many times have you"
3523.5,3524.5," read it, you know?"
3524.5,3526.5," I mean, it's easy to go back and hit that again."
3526.5,3528.22, I still read green eggs in him.
3528.22,3529.22, Yeah.
3529.22,3530.22, I know my favorite short stories.
3530.22,3531.22, It's a great run.
3531.22,3533.22, It's a great run here to talk about.
3533.22,3534.22, It's so funny.
3534.22,3535.22, We're in your flash if that was better.
3535.22,3537.22, You're green eggs in him.
3537.22,3538.22," No, green lantern."
3538.22,3539.22, Yeah.
3539.22,3540.22, Green lantern.
3540.22,3541.22, Green lantern.
3541.22,3542.22, Green eggs in him.
3542.22,3543.22, Five.
3543.22,3545.22, Green lanterns in him.
3545.22,3546.22, Yeah.
3546.22,3547.22, Sinester.
3547.22,3548.22, Sinester.
3548.22,3549.22, I should take one of those breaks.
3549.22,3550.22, Okay.
3550.22,3551.22," Well, we'll take a break."
3551.22,3556.22," Uh, and we'll be back with lots more."

3585.2999999999997,3589.14," Hey, we're back."
3589.14,3591.66," You know, we haven't talked about games pretty much this all time."
3591.66,3594.2999999999997," We've been like, I'll straight with, you know, with a game."
3594.3,3595.3, I'm not that right now.
3595.3,3596.3, It's nonsense.
3596.3,3597.82, It's not what the kids listened to.
3597.82,3598.82, Here for.
3598.82,3603.46," I had some while I was gone up there and I was hanging with my friend, I had so many"
3603.46,3604.46, things.
3604.46,3608.38," I was like, I should make a mental note of this, which is to say that I did make a mental"
3608.38,3610.86," note of it, uh, and for the podcast."
3610.86,3611.86, But now I forget them all.
3611.86,3613.86, I've had an odd game in a question.
3613.86,3614.86, It was random as shit.
3614.86,3619.46," Like, one was we were joking on, um, you know, uh, you know, anything about the Wu"
3619.46,3620.46, Tain clan.
3620.46,3621.46, Yeah.
3621.46,3622.46, What you know about the Wu Tain clan.
3622.46,3623.46, Now the Wu Tain clan.
3623.46,3626.06, I'm part of the part of the shit about that.
3626.06,3633.2200000000003," That's like hilarious in in a good way is that the numerology and stuff that the risen,"
3633.2200000000003,3636.26," the jizz are always trying to drop, you know, they're like, yeah, this is significant,"
3636.26,3637.26," you know, the check."
3637.26,3638.7, Don't they have like ghost face killer in them?
3638.7,3639.7, You.
3639.7,3640.7, They got the ghost face.
3640.7,3641.7, Say he's one of the Wu Tain clan.
3641.7,3642.7, They would.
3642.7,3643.7, So I know my right.
3643.7,3644.7, I know my right.
3644.7,3645.7, Wu Tain calculus.
3645.7,3646.7, And it never makes any sense.
3646.7,3649.06," They say, you know, oh, there's, you know, we call this chess chess, this track,"
3649.06,3652.26," uh, chess box in because, you know, there's so and so many squares on the chess board."
3652.26,3654.86, You divide that by number of members in the Wu Tain clan.
3654.86,3657.9," Uh, you multiply that by number of tracks on the album."
3657.9,3663.7000000000003," You get like the name of God and whatever, you know, like, uh, but so, there's an infamous"
3663.7000000000003,3664.7000000000003, for that kind of thing.
3664.7000000000003,3669.1400000000003, We're just talking about like blowing smoke up people's asses for whatever reason and saying
3669.1400000000003,3671.2200000000003," how, uh, what did it come from?"
3671.2200000000003,3675.9," The square taking the taking the square root of, uh, of Wu Tain clan to get something."
3675.9,3679.86," But anyway, we were like, okay, what if we, what if we tried to, um, interview"
3679.86,3684.38," Reza for the podcast, but just say, which is just dreaming, like I said, this is like"
3684.38,3685.38, some bullshit.
3685.38,3686.58, I wouldn't even want to be with us.
3686.58,3687.58, He's got shit to do.
3687.58,3688.58, He's got a new album to release.
3688.58,3689.58, He's coming out this year.
3689.58,3691.42, Like you talked to him about that.
3691.42,3694.78," But like, you know, they had the Wu Tain game, but just to go to him, like a pro, which"
3694.78,3697.6200000000003," is guy, like, you know, like this game changed your life."
3697.6200000000003,3699.34, And this was like the sickest game ever.
3699.34,3703.1800000000003," And just be pointing out all sorts of stuff like a significance junkie, where no significance"
3703.1800000000003,3704.1800000000003, is there.
3704.1800000000003,3705.54, Like a lost fan gone gone wrong.
3705.54,3706.54, Sure.
3706.54,3709.82," Um, and if you could do it the straight face, but I mean, that's like a danger."
3709.82,3710.82, Just prosper.
3710.82,3712.3, Prospect trying to punk a reason like that.
3712.3,3716.1400000000003," But I mean, just, you know, all the things you can tell them about how this game, the Wu"
3716.1400000000003,3718.54," Tain, the Wu Tain clan game, it was so good."
3718.54,3719.54," You know, there was a Devok game."
3719.54,3720.54, Do you remember that?
3720.54,3721.54," No, adventure."
3721.54,3722.54, So the smart control.
3722.54,3723.54, That was a CD.
3723.54,3726.78," It was like, like, one of those, like, move, yeah, they were, they were like a little"
3726.78,3728.34, quick time videos of Devo.
3728.34,3729.34, Yeah.
3729.34,3732.5800000000004, It was all based on Devos whole mythology.
3732.5800000000004,3733.5800000000004," You know, they have a mythology."
3733.5800000000004,3734.5800000000004, Yeah.
3734.5800000000004,3735.5800000000004, They have a mythos.
3735.5800000000004,3736.5800000000004, They have stories.
3736.5800000000004,3737.5800000000004," They don't have a, they have a mythos."
3737.5800000000004,3738.5800000000004, They have a mythos.
3738.8199999999997,3743.22," Even if man think, believe speaking of game universes, that's right."
3743.22,3747.86, Let's talk about the big one.
3747.86,3748.86, Yeah.
3748.86,3755.14, The epic story of Halo finally released today.
3755.14,3756.62," Tonight, non-no-no-yawning."
3756.62,3757.62, No-yawning.
3757.62,3758.94, We're all happy.
3758.94,3759.94, No hating.
3759.94,3760.94, We're all happy.
3760.94,3761.94, Right.
3761.94,3762.94, It could be sick.
3762.94,3763.94," No, it could be great."
3763.94,3767.1," We're not happy, though, because it's been overexposed in certain ways."
3767.1,3768.1, Yeah.
3768.14,3769.1, We're going to bring this up today.
3769.1,3771.74," Because, you know, I blogged about it."
3771.74,3778.06," I blogged, uh, I guess this morning or last night, because I was seeing the blog editor"
3778.06,3781.22, blogs getting clogged up with Halo 3 stuff.
3781.22,3784.2999999999997," And, you know, a couple of comments on there were like, what do you have to hate?"
3784.2999999999997,3786.7, You haven't even played yet.
3786.7,3788.38," And, you know, we don't."
3788.38,3789.38, We don't hate the Halo.
3789.38,3790.38," No, I like the Halo."
3790.38,3791.38, We don't.
3791.38,3794.14," In fact, I think all four of us in this room have played Halo 1 and 2."
3794.14,3795.14, Yeah.
3795.14,3796.14, Yeah.
3796.14,3797.14, All the way through.
3797.14,3797.98, Probably multiple times.
3798.06,3798.98, This is a genius.
3798.98,3799.98, I love it.
3799.98,3800.98, I like it.
3800.98,3801.98, Right.
3801.98,3802.98, Exactly.
3802.98,3803.98, So this is one of the questions.
3803.98,3804.98, Folks had for me.
3804.98,3808.66," Someone said, like, well, you guys, all we say, like, what's a big deal about Halo, like,"
3808.66,3811.42," you know, you say you're not being PC snobs about it."
3811.42,3816.22, But so what is it about it that doesn't excite you the way it does other people?
3816.22,3818.22, So I thought maybe we could talk about that a little.
3818.22,3819.22, It's for me.
3819.22,3823.86, It's a case of it's so hyped up when I feel there are just so many other first person
3823.86,3826.46, shooter who kind of games that are just more worthy of being hyped.
3826.46,3828.7," To me, that's a turn off in a lot of cases."
3828.7,3833.66," And even before I was, you know, doing this as my living, like, hype would always just"
3833.66,3834.66, kind of.
3834.66,3835.66, It's a little bit of a backlash.
3835.66,3837.66, It's a feature reaction.
3837.66,3838.66," Oh, yeah."
3838.66,3839.66, I see.
3839.66,3840.42," I mean, like, you're walking with 7-Eleven."
3840.42,3847.46," There's a game fuel mountain dude slushy slurping that's, you know, tied with a limited"
3847.46,3848.46, edition Halo 3.
3848.46,3851.46, So it has a success killed it a little bit.
3851.46,3852.46," For you, do you think?"
3852.46,3853.46, Or part of it.
3853.46,3854.46, It has.
3854.46,3855.46," And I think, but it's like this."
3856.46,3862.1," I mean, the success of, I mean, we have to acknowledge how well they're handling the marketing"
3862.1,3863.1, of this game.
3863.1,3864.1," Oh, it's like a chance."
3864.1,3867.1," They got, and here's kind of what happens."
3867.1,3868.46, They got cover story and wire.
3868.46,3870.26, They got stories in newsweektime.
3870.26,3872.38," Every major publication, USA today."
3872.38,3873.38, Yeah.
3873.38,3875.38, And that's great PR.
3875.38,3877.98," If you're a PR person, no, they're high five and like crazy."
3877.98,3880.1," Those are all, like, massive scores."
3880.1,3883.94, I saw it on the web page as a practically every newspaper today.
3883.94,3886.3," I mean, all the news organizations have open."
3886.3,3888.3, It's the Halo release.
3888.3,3890.26," Gamers, they're going wild tonight at midnight."
3890.26,3892.26, And there's something that's crazy about that.
3892.26,3896.26," Like Robert Ashley, about Bito, who's probably going to join us next week."
3896.26,3899.18," You know, it's pointing out that he from like, seen it."
3899.18,3904.18," He's getting these, what he describes weird emails where it's like offering up the entire"
3904.18,3909.1," editorial staffs to any, you know, reporter or whatever who wants to say, have any kind"
3909.1,3910.7000000000003, of quote by the game and everything.
3910.7,3915.66," And it's like, there's just this massive push because what happens is, you know, you"
3915.66,3919.2799999999997," say, you say to time or whatever, like everyone wants, you know, they pitch the story"
3919.2799999999997,3920.2799999999997," to him, you should cover this."
3920.2799999999997,3921.9399999999996, This is the biggest thing ever.
3921.9399999999996,3923.58," And it's like you're creating, I mean, and it was."
3923.58,3927.74," I'm not saying this makes it, but it creates this feedback loop where it becomes, if"
3927.74,3929.14, that thing that it's supposed to be.
3929.14,3930.14, Probably she's on itself.
3930.14,3933.74," And then, you know, we're like, well, shit, everyone, this games everywhere."
3933.74,3935.5," I mean, this is the biggest phenomena of the year."
3935.5,3936.5, We better cover it.
3936.5,3940.3399999999997, And then everyone that jumps in and does that helps the snowball accumulate.
3940.42,3945.6200000000003," And tilt the end, you're like, I mean, you know, to the end when someone out there,"
3945.6200000000003,3949.58," no offense to the people involved in the making of it, but there's someone excited about"
3949.58,3952.7000000000003," to see a video of some, some dudes opening the box."
3952.7000000000003,3956.94, The fetishist video of what you get to that point.
3956.94,3962.3," And shit, yeah, like then, then you're like, well, this better be some damn potent shit."
3962.3,3963.3, Yeah.
3963.3,3964.3," If it's, right."
3964.3,3967.5," I mean, you mentioned talking it up like this, you damn better."
3967.5,3968.9," Well, get me high on this load."
3968.9,3969.9, Right.
3969.9,3975.14," And then you're like, you know, talking about this shit, be a Jamaican."
3975.14,3976.14, It might just come clean.
3976.14,3979.14," So, so Halo Red, Halo Green."
3979.14,3980.14, Yeah.
3980.14,3987.6600000000003," I mean, we, right, that that specific one point, you know, on my blog today, I mentioned"
3987.6600000000003,3994.38, that I pointed out that in a semi-disparaging way that are good friends here at one
3994.38,3998.46, of a pedposts video showing them opening the box.
3998.46,3999.46," And I was like, really?"
3999.46,4000.46, Right.
4000.46,4003.54," And I know that Sean Elliott, you here, we're talking to them today."
4003.54,4004.54, Yeah.
4004.54,4006.38," I didn't want Damian, you know, to tell me what this is."
4006.38,4010.62," And anybody there for doing, but there is, there is a little bit of a danger of that,"
4010.62,4017.5," yeah, you are, or we, we are contributing to the, to the hype ourselves."
4017.5,4018.82," We're, we're making the story."
4018.82,4019.82, It's exactly what we're saying.
4019.82,4020.82, Exactly.
4020.82,4022.34," And you, you put yourself into that position."
4022.34,4024.34," I mean, and all, I mean, on the other hand, you know,"
4024.34,4027.78, I sent that link to my nephew who's 16 years old.
4027.78,4028.78, Probably.
4028.78,4029.78, I didn't say anything.
4029.78,4031.5," I just, hey, Josh, check this out."
4031.5,4032.5, And he loved it.
4032.5,4035.9, I've had the same thing like Rob Rios asking Rob Rios playing the game.
4035.9,4037.06," I was like, you know, what do you think of it?"
4037.06,4040.02," And he's like, I like it, but you got to keep in mind that it's made for 12 to 17"
4040.02,4042.1000000000004, year olds to 12 to 17 year boys.
4042.1000000000004,4045.5," And if you keep that in mind, like you can, that's the idea for what it is."
4045.5,4046.5," No, the game."
4046.5,4047.5," I mean, the game."
4047.5,4051.1000000000004," He's really, I got a, a specific, a range for the opening of the box video."
4051.1000000000004,4053.2200000000003," No, but, yeah, you could see."
4053.2200000000003,4054.2200000000003," I mean, imagine, yeah."
4054.22,4058.14, That would have been fantastic thing to watch if I were that age.
4058.14,4059.74," So, you know, nothing gets them."
4059.74,4064.14," But I think, you know, we're a little older and for us, we just see nothing but consumer"
4064.14,4068.7799999999997," consumer porn and still since we're, we're never going to really be able to do it."
4068.7799999999997,4070.18, I want to say what our idea was.
4070.18,4071.18, Okay.
4071.18,4072.18," So, we can't really do it."
4072.18,4076.7799999999997, But we're talking about making a parody of the video that is on game videos right
4076.7799999999997,4079.58," now where, you know, we get some pieces shit."
4079.58,4081.22," PC games, you know,"
4081.2999999999997,4083.8199999999997," who's like the fifth, who's like, who's like, who's like, who's like, who's like, who's"
4083.8199999999997,4084.8199999999997, an expansion.
4084.8199999999997,4088.2999999999997, Darren comes running in with the box and we have the one up video crew here.
4088.2999999999997,4090.58," Darren going, guys, guys, ladies here."
4090.58,4092.2599999999998," Play the,"
4092.2599999999998,4093.2599999999998," the,"
4093.2599999999998,4095.2599999999998," the,"
4095.2599999999998,4096.0199999999995," the,"
4096.0199999999995,4097.3," the,"
4097.3,4097.9," the,"
4097.9,4099.46, the 2001 model is music.
4099.46,4100.94, I forget what the name of the pieces.
4100.94,4101.66," What the,"
4101.66,4102.179999999999," I think,"
4102.179999999999,4103.38," yeah, sure."
4103.38,4105.139999999999," Right, right, the 2001 music."
4105.139999999999,4106.139999999999," Yeah,"
4106.139999999999,4108.139999999999, or some Wagner or something.
4108.139999999999,4108.54," Right,"
4108.54,4108.98," I think,"
4108.98,4110.9," yeah,"
4110.9,4113.419999999999, we get at the exact on knife and open it up and all.
4113.419999999999,4114.62, It's here.
4114.62,4115.98, Just be careful when you touch it.
4115.98,4116.419999999999," I mean, touch it."
4116.419999999999,4118.459999999999," I mean, it's an important piece of history and culture."
4118.459999999999,4119.66, So hand-lit like that.
4121.66,4123.66, I'm gonna slip that shit into a mile or a bag afterwards.
4123.66,4125.459999999999," So I think a few of us have,"
4125.459999999999,4126.78," hailed three, we're gonna play it."
4126.78,4127.82, I'm gonna play it tonight.
4127.82,4128.82, Here's yours.
4128.82,4129.82, And I'm looking forward to it.
4129.82,4130.259999999999," See,"
4130.259999999999,4131.259999999999," I know,"
4131.259999999999,4133.0599999999995," this is the sort of thing that makes,"
4133.0599999999995,4134.9," that contributes to your,"
4136.0199999999995,4136.94, it works the opposite way.
4136.94,4138.94, Basically it makes it harder for you to enjoy the game going.
4138.94,4140.419999999999, Because of the expectation set.
4140.419999999999,4140.86," Yeah, so,"
4140.86,4142.0199999999995," if you say today,"
4142.0199999999995,4142.82," story,"
4142.82,4145.0199999999995," which is ridiculous on many counts,"
4145.0199999999995,4145.58," we have,"
4146.58,4148.0199999999995," it's Peter Mollinger, right?"
4148.0199999999995,4148.86," Yeah,"
4148.86,4149.7, Mollinger?
4149.7,4150.379999999999," You are new,"
4150.379999999999,4151.0199999999995, is what I know.
4151.0199999999995,4151.58," Okay,"
4151.58,4152.58, and he knew you.
4152.58,4153.0599999999995," Peter,"
4153.0599999999995,4153.379999999999," Peter,"
4153.379999999999,4154.219999999999," Mollinger,"
4154.219999999999,4155.219999999999," Peter,"
4155.219999999999,4156.379999999999," so he says,"
4158.219999999999,4159.74, hailed delivers it in the way
4159.74,4161.099999999999, that more than ever
4161.099999999999,4162.7, before is emotionally engaging.
4162.7,4163.5," And our industry,"
4163.5,4165.98, hailed represents pretty much the top of the game
4165.98,4167.339999999999, of what we're able to do
4167.34,4169.14, with our dramatic content.
4169.14,4170.06," So,"
4170.06,4171.1," there, you're like,"
4171.1,4172.22," I really think it's like,"
4172.22,4174.1, that's Peter asking for six more months
4174.1,4176.54, of the dollar time for Fablescrew.
4176.54,4177.7," But,"
4177.7,4179.42," doing,"
4179.42,4180.1," but beyond that,"
4180.1,4180.5," I mean,"
4180.5,4182.78, this is no Peter really you are saying
4182.78,4183.62, that that was about to say.
4183.62,4185.18, This is the top of the fucking form
4185.18,4186.38, in dramatic content.
4186.38,4187.860000000001, It might be the top of the form
4187.860000000001,4189.78, in shooting some purple fucking Google
4189.78,4192.82, entertainingly has Satan's pit fork
4192.82,4194.5, in his back as he spoke that line.
4194.5,4194.860000000001," I don't,"
4194.860000000001,4196.14, maybe he believes that I don't know.
4196.14,4197.62," Or maybe he wants to be like,"
4197.62,4200.62, it's probably going to make a cool twist.
4200.62,4201.740000000001, And that was cool.
4201.740000000001,4202.22," Yeah,"
4202.22,4204.06," the trailer too was just a dramatic,"
4204.06,4205.5, narrative disaster.
4205.5,4206.900000000001," Well, you didn't like little shopahars,"
4206.900000000001,4207.660000000001," Audrey too,"
4207.660000000001,4208.5, whatever.
4208.5,4209.06," I mean,"
4209.06,4210.5, there's a lot of great things
4210.5,4211.5," about the Halo frantic,"
4211.5,4213.26, but I think touting this story
4213.26,4214.06, or it's dramatic.
4214.06,4215.700000000001, I don't know about that.
4215.700000000001,4216.5," So the music,"
4216.5,4217.14," I could actually,"
4217.14,4218.1," it's a reasonable,"
4218.1,4218.9400000000005, it's a kind of cool in this thing.
4218.9400000000005,4219.34," But I mean,"
4219.34,4219.54," it's,"
4219.54,4220.14," I don't,"
4220.14,4221.900000000001, the story is not what I'm playing this for.
4221.900000000001,4222.14," Yeah,"
4222.14,4222.54," I mean,"
4222.54,4222.740000000001," I,"
4222.740000000001,4223.34," yeah,"
4223.34,4223.740000000001," yeah,"
4223.740000000001,4223.900000000001," like,"
4223.900000000001,4226.06," at highlighting this is that we're not,"
4226.06,4226.900000000001," you know,"
4226.900000000001,4227.54," saying that,"
4227.54,4227.780000000001," hey,"
4227.780000000001,4229.54," maybe that statement right there,"
4229.54,4231.3, does hold true for Halo 3?
4231.3,4232.14, I don't know.
4232.14,4232.9800000000005," Yeah, I don't know."
4232.9800000000005,4233.14," Yeah,"
4233.14,4234.820000000001, but he's not saying he's not making
4234.820000000001,4236.3, that claim for Halo 3.
4236.3,4237.700000000001, He's made it for the series.
4237.700000000001,4238.14," Yeah,"
4238.14,4239.700000000001," I should start it earlier in that he says,"
4239.700000000001,4240.18," Halo,"
4240.18,4240.9800000000005," as in the series,"
4240.9800000000005,4242.620000000001, does what a truly good book or film
4242.620000000001,4243.820000000001, or TV showed us.
4243.820000000001,4244.38," And it does,"
4244.38,4245.34, and it delivers in the way
4245.34,4247.02, that's more emotionally engaging
4247.02,4247.860000000001, than there.
4247.860000000001,4248.22," You know,"
4248.22,4251.06, maybe this is just my experience with the people I know
4251.06,4251.700000000001," and myself,"
4251.700000000001,4252.580000000001," but the,"
4252.580000000001,4254.3," the people I know who are like,"
4254.3,4256.02," hardcore Halo fanbook,"
4256.02,4257.9800000000005," and the voice and the includes my nephew,"
4257.9800000000005,4259.18," their fanboys,"
4259.18,4260.46," not because of the universe,"
4260.46,4262.26, their fanboys because of the multiplayer.
4262.26,4262.860000000001, Right.
4262.860000000001,4263.46, Yeah.
4263.46,4264.46," So,"
4264.46,4265.46," and yet we're told,"
4265.46,4268.46," though, that most of the people play the game,"
4268.46,4269.5," for the single player,"
4269.5,4270.18," and then that, you know,"
4270.18,4272.26," the emphasis on the reviews should be on the campaign,"
4272.26,4273.06, and this and that.
4273.06,4273.900000000001, And that's what you use.
4273.900000000001,4276.14," And that's what everyone talks about in stories like this,"
4276.14,4277.06," like the USA today,"
4277.06,4278.3," we're again,"
4280.3,4281.3," the guy says that it's,"
4281.3,4281.860000000001," you know,"
4281.860000000001,4283.860000000001," that the game's in the epic tradition that gave us,"
4283.860000000001,4284.42," the elite,"
4284.42,4285.06," the honesty,"
4285.06,4285.900000000001, and the history of the game.
4285.900000000001,4286.860000000001," Oh, being really awakened."
4287.9800000000005,4289.5," Well, this is mainstream media,"
4289.5,4290.34," and it's like not,"
4290.34,4290.9800000000005," you know,"
4290.9800000000005,4293.1, this is where the marketing machine really works.
4293.1,4293.3, Yeah.
4293.3,4295.46," And then because you don't read articles about this,"
4295.46,4297.3," about the Half-Life universe,"
4297.3,4297.9800000000005," which,"
4297.9800000000005,4299.22," and I would say,"
4299.22,4300.860000000001," like, let's get this straight."
4300.860000000001,4304.38, I would not make these kind of claims for Half-Life.
4304.38,4304.700000000001," No, you know,"
4304.700000000001,4306.46," I'm not going to say that the shit is,"
4306.46,4307.34," is good as,"
4307.34,4307.580000000001," you know,"
4307.580000000001,4308.42," some of my favorite,"
4308.42,4308.700000000001," you know,"
4308.700000000001,4309.34," works a litter,"
4309.34,4309.780000000001," turn anything,"
4309.780000000001,4311.54," because on the dramatic form,"
4311.54,4312.860000000001," I don't really think it is,"
4312.860000000001,4313.38, right?
4313.38,4314.26," A monk went,"
4314.26,4315.5, and compared with other games
4315.5,4317.9800000000005," and what's the range of experiences available,"
4317.9800000000005,4319.900000000001, and I think it's fucking phenomenal.
4319.900000000001,4320.74, Yeah.
4320.74,4322.58, But I'm not going to say that about Half-Life.
4322.58,4322.900000000001," Like,"
4322.900000000001,4323.74, why?
4323.74,4324.3," Like, you got to get out of here,"
4324.3,4324.54," dude,"
4324.54,4326.14," you just try to tell me this shit about Halo,"
4326.14,4328.18, at least with Halo 1 and Halo 2.
4328.18,4328.62," Okay,"
4328.62,4329.860000000001," and then the purple plant comes out,"
4329.860000000001,4330.34," like,"
4330.34,4330.66," like,"
4330.66,4331.06," oh,"
4331.06,4331.3," yeah,"
4331.3,4332.14," I mean,"
4332.14,4333.9400000000005," that's some feed machine,"
4333.9400000000005,4334.18," like,"
4334.18,4334.9800000000005," you got to be,"
4334.9800000000005,4335.5," oh,"
4335.5,4337.14," I feel like I couldn't finish the last level,"
4337.14,4338.34, so it just stopped.
4338.34,4339.820000000001," Oh,"
4339.820000000001,4340.860000000001," and it's for the,"
4340.860000000001,4341.5," and we asked,"
4341.5,4342.1," like,"
4342.1,4342.9800000000005," why are,"
4342.9800000000005,4344.14," it's not that I'm a hate about,"
4344.14,4345.1," but for what reasons,"
4345.1,4348.06," do you say that you like Halo,"
4348.06,4349.02, but not love it?
4349.02,4350.38," And these are some of the reasons,"
4350.38,4350.900000000001," you know,"
4350.900000000001,4351.38," yep,"
4351.38,4353.38, everything I described about the way
4353.38,4355.38," that the characterization,"
4355.38,4356.860000000001," that variety,"
4356.860000000001,4357.740000000001, and all these other things
4357.740000000001,4358.54," are at play,"
4358.54,4358.820000000001," you know,"
4358.820000000001,4360.1," in Half-Life games,"
4360.1,4362.1," they're not there in,"
4362.1,4363.9400000000005," in Halo 1 and 2,"
4363.9400000000005,4364.3, right?
4364.3,4365.9800000000005, And it's just that sense of a movie.
4365.9800000000005,4366.820000000001, Here's a movie.
4366.820000000001,4367.1," I mean,"
4367.1,4367.9800000000005," now you're an arbiter,"
4367.9800000000005,4368.5," whatever,"
4368.5,4368.780000000001," it's like,"
4368.780000000001,4369.14," dude,"
4369.14,4369.900000000001," I'm the same guy,"
4369.900000000001,4371.14, but now I can turn invisible.
4371.14,4372.900000000001, My hand might be a little different.
4372.900000000001,4373.26," I mean,"
4373.26,4374.22," that's really,"
4374.22,4375.22, a lot of it for me
4375.22,4377.54," in the why I don't go Gaga over it,"
4377.54,4380.66, is my personal opinion
4380.66,4383.54, is the repetitiveness of the environments.
4383.54,4384.62," I never feel like,"
4384.62,4385.42," I don't have any,"
4385.42,4386.26," like, strong sense,"
4386.26,4388.26, even between the two games.
4388.26,4389.62," Like when I think of Halo,"
4389.62,4390.74," just,"
4390.74,4391.18," you know,"
4391.18,4393.1, I just think like purple and green.
4393.1,4393.38," Right,"
4393.38,4394.22," it's like,"
4394.22,4396.02," that's why I said that the Pac-Man analogy,"
4396.02,4396.54," for me,"
4396.54,4398.3, it is very much a shooter version
4398.3,4399.54, of a Pac-Man maze.
4399.54,4400.780000000001," There's no place,"
4400.780000000001,4402.14," there's no sense that,"
4402.14,4404.900000000001, these are locations that exist anywhere.
4404.900000000001,4408.02, There's no rhyme or reason to anything.
4408.02,4409.02," When they take you,"
4409.02,4411.18," it's supposed to be these,"
4411.18,4412.9800000000005," the pinnacle of their game,"
4412.9800000000005,4413.18," you know,"
4413.18,4414.5," they let's raise the stakes and say,"
4414.5,4415.3," now you know,"
4415.3,4415.42," you know,"
4415.42,4415.900000000001, one to earth.
4415.900000000001,4416.1," Yeah,"
4416.1,4417.780000000001, it's not just some like random
4417.780000000001,4418.9400000000005, corridor in a spaceship.
4418.9400000000005,4419.780000000001, This is your planet.
4419.780000000001,4420.9400000000005," And then you go to earth,"
4420.9400000000005,4421.3," you know,"
4421.3,4421.9400000000005, what the fuck is this?
4421.9400000000005,4422.780000000001, Like earth.
4422.780000000001,4423.06," Yeah,"
4423.06,4424.780000000001," this is supposed to be like,"
4424.780000000001,4426.02, what a part of Africa is
4426.02,4427.46, in corridors on earth.
4427.46,4428.06, Yeah.
4428.06,4429.06, Yeah.
4429.06,4429.820000000001," See now we're,"
4429.820000000001,4430.660000000001, now we're hating on it.
4431.62,4432.0199999999995," You have to tell me,"
4432.0199999999995,4432.82," you're hating on,"
4432.82,4433.22," hey,"
4433.22,4433.86, let's read.
4433.86,4434.7, Like I'm fuckers.
4434.7,4435.78," So what we're saying though,"
4435.78,4436.42," parat to like,"
4436.42,4437.7, we like the shooting.
4437.7,4438.7, We like to combat.
4438.7,4439.0199999999995, Right.
4439.0199999999995,4439.78, That's what I'm saying.
4439.78,4440.82, I like to combat.
4440.82,4441.78," If it's great,"
4441.78,4443.3, I like to read the sheikles.
4443.3,4445.22, I like and drive the vehicles.
4445.22,4445.74, That's right.
4445.74,4447.82, That is it for the single player game.
4447.82,4449.58, That is all for me.
4449.58,4450.66, And I'm being completely honest.
4450.66,4452.38, That is all there is to that game.
4452.38,4453.22, And it does it well.
4453.22,4453.9, That can be fun.
4453.9,4455.34," Like I think in this,"
4455.34,4457.34, here's a war is very similar for me
4457.34,4458.3, in that respect.
4458.3,4459.42, And I think it's a fun game.
4459.42,4460.38," And for that,"
4460.38,4461.62," the same reason I like Halo,"
4461.62,4462.3, I like to play it.
4462.3,4463.1, And I want to play it.
4463.1,4464.58, That alone is enough.
4464.58,4465.66, But when you start coming with
4465.66,4466.82," these grandiose statements,"
4466.82,4467.74," all these other claims,"
4467.74,4469.14," well, this is my whole problem."
4469.14,4469.9800000000005, Right.
4469.9800000000005,4470.54, And that's my problem is it.
4470.54,4471.78, And that's what I said on my blog.
4471.78,4472.9800000000005," It's that I like the franticist,"
4472.9800000000005,4473.9800000000005, but I don't get it.
4473.9800000000005,4478.42, I don't get why this one gets all the love.
4478.42,4480.54, When I don't see it as being so phenomenal.
4480.54,4481.9, So what's going to be a franticist?
4481.9,4482.74, Do you buy a shot?
4482.74,4483.74, That's exactly what I was talking about.
4483.74,4484.58, There you go.
4484.58,4485.42, Biosha.
4485.42,4487.58, If it has a more compelling story.
4487.58,4488.42, Right.
4488.42,4489.66, And that's not a good thing.
4489.66,4491.02," I mean, that's all the time."
4491.02,4492.74," Well, because I'm saying for Halo,"
4492.74,4493.06," I mean,"
4493.06,4495.5, maybe Halo 3's story is just some kick-ass shit.
4495.5,4498.34," I know she did say there wasn't a single wow, wow moment"
4498.34,4499.7, or something like that in the game.
4499.7,4500.22, You know what?
4500.22,4501.62," I'm just, I'm just, I'm just,"
4501.62,4502.78," I'm just like,"
4502.78,4504.38, bad considering that half like two.
4504.38,4507.02, So two is nothing but wow moment after the other.
4507.02,4508.54, I've only played a little bit.
4508.54,4510.22," I only, I didn't have that much time this weekend."
4510.22,4513.06, I only made me like an out two or three hours into Halo 3.
4513.06,4514.06, Mm-hmm.
4514.06,4515.9400000000005, And this is a totally subjective test.
4515.9400000000005,4518.22," But I use Amy, my wife."
4518.38,4520.14, So she watched me play this game.
4520.14,4522.26," And like, she also watched me play a lot of Bioshok."
4522.26,4523.820000000001, And she was loving watching Bioshok.
4523.820000000001,4525.9400000000005, And she actually wanted to like help out and play it.
4525.9400000000005,4527.5," But Halo 3's like inside of 10 minutes,"
4527.5,4528.3, she's like this is stupid.
4528.3,4530.9800000000005," And she was like, didn't care, didn't."
4530.9800000000005,4532.54," But that on the box there, you have it."
4532.54,4533.54, Yeah.
4533.54,4535.9800000000005," I mean, but Amy didn't like that."
4535.9800000000005,4537.14," I just, I know."
4537.14,4538.740000000001, But that's standard though.
4538.740000000001,4541.06, I don't want to say Amy's like my cat.
4541.06,4542.06, Yeah.
4542.06,4543.54, Do my cat.
4543.54,4544.38, But watch it.
4544.38,4545.58, We'll watch America's funny.
4545.58,4546.42, It's so funny.
4546.42,4547.26, Oh shit.
4547.26,4548.1, There we go.
4548.1,4549.5, Watch the news or anything else.
4549.5,4554.1," No, but it will because there's other stuff going on."
4554.1,4556.860000000001," Where I was, okay, so now my."
4556.860000000001,4561.06," You know, I can't know, but I was going with this."
4561.06,4562.5," I mean, if you're going to call a game,"
4562.5,4564.280000000001, it's a game of epic proportions.
4564.280000000001,4566.860000000001, You got to at least back up and be able to like cater to somebody
4566.860000000001,4569.400000000001, besides the 12 to 17 year old market.
4569.400000000001,4571.3," It doesn't, yeah, but I mean, on that,"
4571.3,4574.04, I don't want to go there because I don't think it has to.
4574.04,4576.34, I don't want to provide any prescription for Halo at all
4576.34,4578.5, because it doesn't need to do it goddamn thing.
4578.5,4582.38," It is like better than, you know, any game marketer"
4582.38,4584.74, or game developers while this expectation's.
4584.74,4587.62, So everyone involved has reason to their damn success.
4587.62,4588.46," You know, right?"
4588.46,4589.3, Why the hell?
4589.3,4592.26, I will say that Bungie has made great game after great game.
4592.26,4596.3, The marathon series stole my favorite FPS series of all time.
4596.3,4599.66," The myth, myth, some of the best real-time strategy"
4599.66,4600.66, games ever.
4600.66,4605.14," And I would also say, one of if not the best stories"
4605.14,4607.9800000000005," in a real-time strategy series ever, the myth games."
4607.9800000000005,4611.9400000000005," So Bungie is totally capable of telling a story, too."
4611.9400000000005,4613.58," So we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we,"
4613.58,4614.9800000000005, I'm just trying to go out of my way here.
4614.9800000000005,4615.14," Yeah, yeah."
4615.14,4617.860000000001," Even though we're going to get it anyway to try to say,"
4617.860000000001,4619.38, we are not halo haters.
4619.38,4620.5," No, I'm actually playing the game."
4620.5,4620.9800000000005, I'm an angel.
4620.9800000000005,4621.780000000001, I'm enjoying it.
4621.780000000001,4624.5," I'm just all of saying is, wow, protesting too much."
4624.5,4626.9800000000005, We're very used to this in music and stuff
4626.9800000000005,4629.58, because it's just been the state and every other format.
4629.58,4630.34," I mean, everything."
4630.34,4633.780000000001," It's like, it's never, the best selling stuff is never the very best"
4634.34,4634.62, of the game.
4634.62,4637.82," Yeah, you could show me a few exceptions to that rule."
4637.82,4638.179999999999, Uh-huh.
4638.179999999999,4638.78," Yeah, right."
4638.78,4640.74," But we're, and we're not, we're don't even argue with it."
4640.74,4643.7," It's like, oh, yeah, like so and so like Kevin Fetterlinds"
4643.7,4646.219999999999, sold more albums this year than A-Sop Rock or whatever.
4646.219999999999,4647.219999999999," It's like, uh-huh."
4647.219999999999,4648.38," Like, you know, you don't even, you don't even,"
4648.38,4649.78," you don't even, you don't even, you don't even bitch about it"
4649.78,4651.78, because you're so used to being the case with the different
4651.78,4655.78," games though, is that where is it might cost you a lot less"
4655.78,4658.54," to, uh, to make an A-Sop Rock album than Fetterlind"
4658.54,4660.46," because you're not paying for X produces,"
4660.46,4662.86, you're not paying for the marketing muscle of this major.
4662.86,4664.9," You know, I don't know what he's on, but like Warner or something"
4664.9,4666.0199999999995," like that, you know."
4666.0199999999995,4668.62," But with games, if you're gonna make a game that competes with this,"
4668.62,4670.82, you do have to spend that much money.
4670.82,4675.139999999999, So it is more of like a scenario where I see something
4675.139999999999,4678.94, that's truly good and I know that a lot of money was spent on it.
4678.94,4680.46," In other words, it was a big risk, you know,"
4680.46,4681.78, I want to see them do as well.
4681.78,4684.0599999999995," And I'm speaking of bio-shock here, you know, and it did."
4684.0599999999995,4684.9, That was great.
4684.9,4686.58, It was wonderful to see that bio-shock did well.
4686.58,4689.74," Yeah, because that would have, I mean, do we ever want another one"
4689.74,4692.219999999999," of these cases, you know, in our long list of games where you're"
4692.22,4694.3," like, oh, God, that was one of the best games that we don't"
4694.3,4695.3, play it.
4695.3,4695.66, Right.
4695.66,4696.3," No, we don't."
4696.3,4697.3, Hit that.
4697.3,4697.900000000001, Right.
4697.900000000001,4703.14," And this release today of Halo is, you know, of Hail 3 is an event."
4703.14,4706.58," You know, it's a mainstream media event, which sort of brings out"
4706.58,4707.780000000001, by its nature.
4707.780000000001,4710.3, They kind of cynical hardcore games.
4710.3,4711.3, That's how we're doing in a store.
4711.3,4712.740000000001," We're not way about everything, though."
4712.740000000001,4716.860000000001," If there's an event where you kind of like Pepsi or something, you know,"
4716.860000000001,4719.46, or like a new like a new TV show.
4719.46,4720.820000000001, And we'd be the same haters.
4720.82,4724.5," Yeah, anytime someone, we live in an environment that's saturated with"
4724.5,4725.34, pitch people.
4725.34,4726.34, Yeah.
4726.34,4729.46," And then when we see the pitch people get through a fever pitch, then we just say,"
4729.46,4731.66," right, we don't like to be a fan of quirky."
4731.66,4733.299999999999, Like we're making a witch.
4733.299999999999,4735.66, We got the in our Halo boxes that we got today.
4735.66,4740.46," We also got the Halo Media Kit, which came in a ridiculous, it was like in the"
4740.46,4743.78, same metal case as the limited edition box.
4743.78,4745.5," Well, lots of sorts of bullshit in here."
4745.5,4750.219999999999," It was like two separate manuals that are like media guides on, you know,"
4750.5,4752.06," the story, this fly."
4752.06,4756.02," I had a point at this is what your is so if you did watch that video, the opening of"
4756.02,4756.54, video.
4756.54,4756.900000000001, Yeah.
4756.900000000001,4758.900000000001," Oh yeah, this was a witcher missing, right?"
4758.900000000001,4759.740000000001, Jeff's about to read.
4759.740000000001,4761.22," Yeah, so that's you were covered in it."
4762.22,4763.38," Yeah, so there's like a, yeah."

4801.62,4802.62, I know.
4802.62,4804.98, Not our demographic.
4804.98,4808.82, And many more have all been known to unwind by playing Halo and have expressed their
4808.82,4810.78, deep passion for the franchise.
4810.78,4815.339999999999," This is like, did like whatever, uh, Grandpa Wither spoon uses preparation."

4817.339999999999,4818.339999999999, You're as fast.
4818.339999999999,4819.58, That's the way that that's a little bit.
4819.58,4820.58, Right.
4820.58,4824.419999999999," In the sports arena, Halo has established itself as the game off the field."

4952.94,4953.94, Is that term loosely?
4953.94,4954.94, Yeah.
4954.94,4957.94, It's like an arcade classic.
4957.94,4959.94, It's a good release of stress.
4959.94,4961.94, Get your mind off things for nine straight hours.
4961.94,4962.94, That's hot.

4969.94,4970.94, It's a good.
4970.94,4973.94, The sad thing is that they fucking printed this page.
4973.94,4975.94, But it's a good as a funny excuse.
4975.94,4977.94, And they sent it to us as if we'll go.
4977.94,4978.94, It's made for us though.
4978.94,4982.94, It's in case you can convince like you know for rolling stone.
4982.94,4984.94, In case you can get variety to review it.
4984.94,4985.94, Okay.
4985.94,4988.94, So let's say I'm just a little bit on some fattle fuck who works on some newspaper.
4988.94,4992.94," I got a story doing like eight hours and like hey, grain."
4992.94,4994.94, Where's the Halo three story?

4999.94,5000.94, I'm gonna copy.
5000.94,5003.94, I can take on my desk and I roll in a sheet of paper into my newspaper.

5025.94,5026.94, Yeah.
5026.94,5028.94, So this is in short.
5028.94,5030.94, This is why we get annoyed by it.
5030.94,5031.94," But hey, low shot."
5031.94,5033.94, Make a white him in the end of that.
5033.94,5034.94, That was like simple.
5034.94,5035.94, That was good.
5035.94,5036.94, Yeah.
5036.94,5038.94, We should get one of those for every game.
5038.94,5040.94, I want to see one of those for the next.

5050.94,5054.94," You look around and you see, you see the exact same thing."
5054.94,5056.94," Like, oh, yeah, I remember reading that like the point."
5056.94,5057.94," Oh, sure."
5057.94,5062.94, And that one classic example was a PlayStation Extreme 2 magazine.
5062.94,5065.94, That a cover story for a Transformers game.
5065.94,5068.94, It wasn't the one connected to the movie with the old PS2.
5068.94,5069.94," Yeah, Xbox one."
5069.94,5073.94," And I'm reading this saying I'm like, holy shit if this doesn't sound familiar."
5073.94,5078.94," And then I dig out on like my junk drawer, my press releases and pull out Transformers."
5078.94,5082.94," There's like 600 words per paste it in, but not even altered."
5082.94,5084.94, Not a fucking word changed.
5084.94,5086.94, Like that was like the beginning of the story.
5086.94,5088.94," I was like, so that's a classic example."
5088.94,5089.94," Yeah, most cases."
5089.94,5090.94, Right.

5167.94,5168.94, Quick.
5168.94,5169.44, Quick.
5169.44,5170.44, That's me.
5170.44,5171.44, It's a tough topic.
5171.44,5173.44," Because you're up, I think."
5173.44,5174.44, Yeah.
5174.44,5175.44, You're going to get a new piece.
5175.44,5177.44, Do we have to play that sweet?
5177.44,5178.44, Ferris Minerich is.
5178.44,5179.44, Damn it.
5179.44,5180.44, Do it a lot.
5180.44,5181.44," And uh, crisis."
5181.44,5182.44, What else is it?
5182.44,5183.44, Crisis.
5183.44,5184.44, Crisis.
5184.44,5185.44, Yeah.
5185.44,5186.44, I'm not in the baby.
5186.44,5187.44," I got on the, uh, how I got it."
5187.44,5188.44, We're going to talk about.
5188.44,5189.44, About how to talk about.
5189.44,5190.44, About how to talk about.
5190.44,5192.44," You're on this week, recording a special podcast."
5192.44,5195.44," So maybe if you're listening, you might get an extra one this week."
5195.44,5196.44, We have time.
5196.44,5197.44, We're up there to figure that out.
5197.44,5198.44, Yeah.
5198.44,5199.44, But do you guys are doing a special secret on?
5199.44,5200.44," No, we can all know it."
5200.44,5202.44," We just have, we just do another one."
5202.44,5203.44, We just tape early.
5203.44,5204.44, There's an event.
5204.44,5208.44," They're, well, there's an event later this week with, uh, happening on a, the US"
5208.44,5209.44," That's one it, right?"
5209.44,5210.44," Oh, that thing."
5210.44,5211.44, That is nothing to do with this other.
5211.44,5212.44," In fact, that he's in countries."
5212.44,5214.44," Well, I think it was there for you."
5214.44,5215.44, Yeah.
5215.44,5216.44, Okay.
5216.44,5217.44, Okay.
5217.44,5218.44, Yeah.
5218.44,5220.44, They're having some events on some battle shape or something out there.
5220.44,5221.44, Right.
5221.44,5222.44, I don't know what that's about.
5222.44,5224.44, I know why they have to have it on a ship.
5224.44,5225.44, I'll let me though.
5225.44,5226.44, Good enough.
5226.44,5227.44, Maybe Dame Cuckel be there.
5227.44,5228.44, Right.
5228.44,5230.44, I hope he's there so I can punch him in the fucking head.
5230.44,5231.44, Hey.
5231.44,5232.44, Hi.
5232.44,5235.44, How the guy has a career just annoys me.
5235.44,5236.44, Yeah.
5236.44,5240.44," I, I just figure we're not the demographic for I've never, I don't know what I'm supposed to."
5240.44,5241.44, What?
5241.44,5242.44, Yeah.
5242.44,5244.44, And I think we're over the age limit for Dame Cuckel.
5244.44,5245.44, Really?
5245.44,5247.44," It's a certain level at which it's just, well, you see those commercials are about"
5247.44,5248.44," Good luck, Chuffard."
5248.44,5249.44," Oh, God."
5249.44,5252.44," And all it is is just like, people get hit and a crouch in two all different ways."
5252.44,5253.44, And then it's over.
5253.44,5254.44, That's like that's it.
5254.44,5255.44, It's just joke about a Gallagher.
5255.44,5256.44, It takes the whole time.
5256.44,5257.44," Yeah, who just wait this night?"
5257.44,5258.44, What we did.
5258.44,5259.44," Yeah, pretty much all here."
5259.44,5264.44," One of my anecdotes that here's my chance to to spill was that in, uh, speaking of"
5264.44,5265.44, Dicks.
5265.44,5268.44, You don't hear that transition.
5268.44,5269.44, And every podcast.
5269.44,5274.44," It's in team fortress, uh, to like the voice over IP is got this really, like,"
5274.44,5275.44, 10 equality to it.
5275.44,5277.44," And then, you know, it was babbling."
5277.44,5280.44," And then, uh, someone's like, R. R. My friend Rory was like,"
5280.44,5282.44, Did you sound like you're in a ton of full of Dicks?
5282.44,5284.44," And then, uh, even make it, he said."
5284.44,5288.44," But then, like, so then I was like trying to cultivate it and like singing like,"
5288.44,5295.44," If you like tunnels and you dig Dicks, then you will love the tunnel full of Dicks."
5295.44,5297.44," Like singing that all in the,"
5297.44,5298.44, Wow.
5298.44,5299.44," Oh, it's true."
5299.44,5301.44," I mean, you see now there's a lot of people."
5301.44,5302.44, It's awful.
5302.44,5303.44, But it was good.
5303.44,5306.44," It was like, that's pretty much what it sounded like."
5306.44,5310.44," The other thing for me forget we had, I was going last week to respond, but we had that"
5310.44,5314.44, mega thread on one up. We're all these people wrote in.
5314.44,5316.44, Tell the thoughts on the show.
5316.44,5317.44, I don't know if you can see it.
5317.44,5318.44," Oh, right."
5318.44,5320.44," But what we said, when element that we saw in there is that we have,"
5320.44,5325.44," and also from, you know, uh, pms and, and other things we get from listeners that we have quite"
5325.44,5329.44," it seemingly quite a few listeners throughout Europe, I in New Zealand, Australia."
5329.44,5330.44, Uh-huh.
5330.44,5333.44," And just wanted to say, hey, thanks for listening."
5333.44,5334.44, Yeah.
5334.44,5335.44," So, uh, bonjour."
5335.44,5337.44, Good day.
5337.44,5338.44, Good day.
5338.44,5339.44," Hey, good evening."
5339.44,5340.44, Buen venu.
5340.44,5341.44, Wil-Comeon.
5341.44,5342.44, Welcome.
5342.44,5343.44, Welcome.
5343.44,5345.44, Diamond Axe.
5345.44,5346.44, You know how you doing.
5346.44,5347.44, Yeah.
5347.44,5349.44," And nothing, like, don't be afraid about posts."
5349.44,5352.44," And not, you know, on our forms even, you know, if you're concerned about the quality of"
5352.44,5355.44," your English, like we're not going to clown you, like someone that says they were"
5355.44,5360.44," afraid, you know, I'm not going to clown you for, for speaking multiple languages."
5360.44,5363.44," No, no, no, you've got something on all of this."
5363.44,5364.44, It doesn't matter how shitty your English is.
5364.44,5367.44," If it's not your first language, like Letter-IP, you know,"
5367.44,5369.44, We can't speak anything else.
5369.44,5370.74," I was going to say, they're English,"
5370.74,5371.82," probably better than my, you know,"
5371.82,5373.099999999999, is better than my German or something.
5373.099999999999,5373.98," Yeah, right."
5373.98,5376.08, We'll only make funny about your back.
5376.08,5377.799999999999, We'll print out your email and then read it to this.
5377.799999999999,5380.12," There was the classic though, the Belgian,"
5380.12,5381.16," I noticed one of the Netherlands,"
5381.16,5384.48," a QSP Contelli, and he used to do the What Ifs,"
5384.48,5385.639999999999, and he would always send him in.
5385.639999999999,5388.32, He still sends him in like a maniac to EGM.
5388.32,5388.5199999999995, Yeah.
5388.5199999999995,5390.32," But the whole time I worked there,"
5390.32,5392.839999999999," he sent these things in, and it came now"
5392.839999999999,5394.32, when that magazine was around.
5394.32,5397.36, And they're just like the most crackpot things you've ever seen.
5397.36,5399.719999999999, They don't make any goddamn sense at all.
5399.719999999999,5400.839999999999," Like, um,"
5400.839999999999,5403.599999999999," because he was Belgian, and they would always,"
5403.599999999999,5406.04," part of it, there was a few language things"
5406.04,5407.44," that made it funnier, because it would always be"
5407.44,5409.32, what if X did?
5409.32,5413.44," So like, for example, like, what if the Mario Kart did,"
5413.44,5417.28," run down, did run over the Blast Course car,"
5417.28,5421.32," and that did become, like, something from a rare game,"
5421.32,5422.16," you know, give me something here."
5422.16,5424.36, Conqueror's fucking squirrel treehouse or something.
5424.36,5425.36, Yeah.
5425.36,5426.679999999999, But that's the thing.
5426.68,5427.72," I mean, that sounds absurd."
5427.72,5429.04, They never make any sex at all.
5429.04,5430.92," It was just a matter of like name checking, like,"
5430.92,5433.56," a couple rare games, and then like maybe a square game"
5433.56,5434.56, or something.
5434.56,5436.52," And then it would always have that red, didn't it?"
5436.52,5438.240000000001, So if there was a big era when I'd go around
5438.240000000001,5439.52," with like, get a low-passenged shit,"
5439.52,5442.04," and it would be like, and every time you just look at someone"
5442.04,5445.52," and like, so what if, uh, it was a classic one."
5445.52,5446.68," Oh, yeah."
5446.68,5450.280000000001, What if Tommy Versetti did fly the Dodo bird?
5450.280000000001,5452.4800000000005," The Dodo into the same city building,"
5452.4800000000005,5454.4400000000005, and Dr. B did rescue.
5454.4400000000005,5455.84," No, no."
5455.84,5456.68, I fucked up.
5456.68,5460.12," No, and Virtua Cop did rescue Dr. B from the stairwell."
5460.12,5460.96, There we go.
5460.96,5463.12," This is why people hate Americans, Sean."
5463.12,5464.12, That's it was hot.
5464.12,5465.12, Yeah.
5465.12,5465.96, Sure.
5465.96,5466.8, That was a game.
5466.8,5467.64, They should have made that a game.
5467.64,5468.4800000000005, Yeah.
5468.4800000000005,5469.92, He was sent pictures of himself covered in the magazine
5469.92,5472.4400000000005," or like, up in the tree, and then she was like naked."
5472.4400000000005,5474.12," No, but he'd be like laying in a field"
5474.12,5476.04, with all bunch of the magazines or ornaments.
5476.04,5476.88," Oh, okay."
5476.88,5477.72, It was weird.
5477.72,5478.24, And he had a thread.
5478.24,5480.92," He made a thread on the forums, and it was just thousands"
5480.92,5483.16," of pages long, and he just, you know, all day long."
5483.16,5484.16, He's adding more.
5484.16,5486.88," I think it's really like a weird form of autism where,"
5488.0,5490.96," you know, like, it's still being like a, you know,"
5490.96,5492.92," human calculator or something, you know,"
5492.92,5494.44, where you're just constantly performing
5494.44,5498.12," and it'll very, you know, mathematical problems,"
5498.12,5499.96, you're solving various mathematical problems in your head
5499.96,5500.8, all day.
5500.8,5503.84, He could not shut off the damn what if machine.
5503.84,5506.96," So all day long, it's just like reshuffling this deck"
5506.96,5507.8, of cards.
5507.8,5508.639999999999, That's what she's basically.
5508.639999999999,5510.12," Yeah, you might have been remexotic."
5510.12,5511.12, And he had to share that.
5511.12,5513.12," And he would write him in like, in, in,"
5513.44,5516.48," you know, pen by hand and draw a little stuff in the margins."
5516.48,5518.24," And every day, EGM for a while,"
5518.24,5520.84," what's still would get an envelope just fat,"
5520.84,5522.44," just stuff, you know, with international,"
5522.44,5525.2," which generates full of the, you want to hire the guy, don't you?"
5525.2,5527.36, Because there might be one every few thousand.
5527.36,5528.5199999999995, They gave him a column.
5528.5199999999995,5530.48," I was going to say that guy, but he's a job at Marvel Comics now,"
5530.48,5531.32, or something.
5531.32,5532.8, Yeah.
5532.8,5535.04," He did, in game now, he did it."
5535.04,5536.8, They actually put a column of that in there.
5536.8,5538.5599999999995, I don't know how they got it.
5538.5599999999995,5541.0," Because you look at it and you're like, what the hell is this?"
5541.0,5543.52," It was like an inside joke or one of those things where they're like,"
5543.52,5545.36," I, this magazine ain't going to be around a while."
5545.36,5546.64," Let's turn it into Gaseppe, Gaseppe's."
5546.64,5548.56, Gaseppe's for her.
5548.56,5551.92," But then Gaseppe, because of that thought that like,"
5551.92,5553.96," I mean, it just encouraged this mania."
5553.96,5555.68," Like, this is some shit I got going here."
5555.68,5556.52, Something.
5556.52,5559.88," And yeah, so then it was like, hey, no more game now."
5559.88,5562.28," Said, gave me a complimentary subscription to EGM."
5562.28,5563.68, Let's see how they like some what is.
5563.68,5565.0," Oh, I see."
5565.0,5566.84," Hey, well, if you're listening, just, just happy."
5566.84,5568.16, We'll take your stuff too.
5568.16,5569.32," Yes, and this is what it is."
5569.32,5570.6, Give us some what if it's not ours.
5570.6,5571.8, It doesn't even have to be about PC.
5571.8,5575.04," But yeah, we got nothing right about the same fucking game."
5575.04,5576.360000000001, We'll read our games over and over.
5576.360000000001,5578.64," After I basically, you mix and match all the shoes."
5578.64,5580.76," Guys, the same as having autism."
5580.76,5583.92," Being a human, I think it would be cheating."
5583.92,5587.240000000001, We'll see if he can write a better world where two lead than some of these other guys.
5587.240000000001,5588.240000000001, Yeah.
5588.240000000001,5589.240000000001, What is?
5589.240000000001,5590.240000000001, We'll watch you game.
5590.240000000001,5591.240000000001, Yeah.
5591.240000000001,5592.240000000001, Okay.
5592.240000000001,5594.240000000001, So are we out?
5594.240000000001,5595.240000000001, Yeah.
5595.240000000001,5596.240000000001, We're going to get out of the pool.
5596.240000000001,5597.240000000001," Yeah, we're at a plant tunnel full of digs."
5597.240000000001,5598.240000000001, Yeah.
5598.32,5599.8, Don't look like a dick.
5599.8,5600.8, Yeah.
5600.8,5603.84, I'm going to be singing at the hallway.
5603.84,5606.08," That was the other shit, too."
5606.08,5608.44," And team forges of voices is cause, yeah."
5608.44,5612.32," Everyone's always asking for, they called it a Uber charge."
5612.32,5614.04, So how would you do that shit?
5614.04,5615.04," You know, like, right?"
5615.04,5619.48, I'm about to rush and you're going to get really used in Uber charge.
5619.48,5620.48, And then Uber charge?
5620.48,5622.76," Yeah, just like butter that shit non-stop."
5622.76,5626.2," Because half the time you're playing, it's like every other word of yours is Uber"
5626.2,5627.2, charger.
5627.2,5628.2, I'm just going to get it right.
5628.2,5630.4, It's like quit talking about the guy that I'm doing.
5630.4,5631.76, I'm doing it in full.
5631.76,5635.599999999999, I'm finding this game to be just fine without the voice chat.

5701.56,5702.56, They're like something.
5702.56,5706.56," Whatever tunnel full of dicks sounds like, it doesn't sound like the way you want to sound."
5706.56,5707.56," When you're, when you're talking."
