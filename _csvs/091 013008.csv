121.3,122.3, Yeah.
122.3,123.3, It wasn't so well-nating.
123.3,124.3, Tantric yoga or anything right.
124.3,125.3," No, I wasn't anything like that."
125.3,127.3, It wasn't anything you would see in second life.
127.3,128.3, Okay.
128.3,132.3," But anyway, so at one point we're doing yoga for a while and I was getting hot."
132.3,140.3, So I had on two shirts and I took one of them off and the shirt underneath was a wow.
140.3,143.3, And I'm sure an alliance t-shirt.
143.3,147.3, So it's that alliance at the top and big letters and then it has like the coat of arms of
147.3,149.10000000000002," the alliance, right?"
149.10000000000002,152.3," Which is us to sort of, you know, whatever I forget what it looks like."

176.3,182.3," She was commenting on the implied aggression, the swords and what it was like alliance."
182.3,186.3," It was, you know, a puppy like, you know, world harmony or something."
186.3,188.3," It was just like, yeah, it's like, so what you tell it, did you?"
188.3,196.3," Well, see, the alliance is, is another warves and norms and humans who were fighting the burning"
196.3,198.3, Legion and the marks that you tell her this.
198.3,199.3," The fun, no."
199.3,204.3, And Archimond came to destroy the world tree in order to sell.
204.3,205.3, That's what I should have done.
205.3,207.3, I should have blown her mind with some wild lore.
207.3,210.3, They would have probably sounded like perfect sense to her.
210.3,211.3, The world tree.
211.3,212.3, The world tree.
212.3,213.3, Yes.
213.3,214.3," Oh, they were true."

233.3,235.3," Yeah, so what a blunder mind."
235.3,237.3, I never learned this.
237.3,239.3, Ram dos never taught me this.
239.3,243.3," Anyway, that was my, that was my story."
243.3,246.3," I taught her, yeah, it's from, I thought it was very action."
246.3,247.3, I taught her was from some game.
247.3,249.3, I'm in the gaming industry.
249.3,251.3," That was like, oh."
251.3,252.3, Okay.

263.3,264.3, Yeah.
264.3,265.3, Okay.
265.3,268.3," I asked, I had a friend in college who was never aware of what he was wearing."
268.3,273.3," To the point that like he would just, I would assume he would have shirts in his closet."
273.3,276.3, He would just grab one and put it on.
276.3,279.3," And then, you know, one was for some local auto body shop."
279.3,283.3," We're not local, but you know, I figured he knew where it was from."
283.3,287.3, So we're all walking down to the Commons to go get some lunch with our food bucks.
287.3,291.3," And so I just started to say, how, yeah, it would be nice to find the weekend off."
291.3,294.3, But I got to go out with whatever to like send Pedro and get my car fixed.
294.3,296.3," You know, basically just reading off his shirt to him."
296.3,298.3," And he's like, no way."
298.3,301.3," You, you, you bend a sandpaper or wherever it was."
301.3,302.3, I'm just making something up.
302.3,305.3," It's like, yeah, I get all my auto body worked on there."
305.3,307.3," And he's just like, we walked the whole way."
308.3,309.3, It's none the wiser.
309.3,312.3," It's how I'm name and I'm going, oh, yeah, I'm going to raise auto works or whatever it is."
312.3,315.3," You know, I just wonder if you're like that guy."

316.3,317.3, Everyone's in a while.
317.3,321.3," I wear my, I have a blue sim city shirt that's like, it says,"
321.3,322.3, S.C.P.D.
322.3,324.3, It's got a big badge right in the center.
324.3,325.3, Huge badge.
325.3,326.3," And it says, S.C.P.D."
326.3,327.3, And big block white letters.
327.3,329.3," Sim, city police department."
329.3,335.3," And once I'm, I was at the Berkeley, Marina with my family and walk in my dog."
335.3,340.3, And this dude came up to me to like ask me a question as if I was a cop.
340.3,343.3, And I was like 10 no idea what the hell he was talking about.
343.3,344.3," He was like, great."
344.3,345.3," He was like, officer."
345.3,348.3," I just was like, well, I'm wearing it like officer."
348.3,349.3, Like what?
349.3,350.3," She's like, my shirt."

354.3,355.3, That'll car you.
355.3,356.3, It's only.
356.3,358.3, And people ask me for help.
358.3,359.3, Really?
359.3,361.3," You know, there's like red and khaki pants."
361.3,363.3, I didn't have the khaki zomba just because I had a red.
363.3,365.3, You should just go down there and grief target.
365.3,366.3, Like where the those color.
366.3,367.3, Where they're uniform.
367.3,368.3, Right.
368.3,369.3," And then people are like, can you help me lift this?"
369.3,370.3, No.
370.3,371.3, Fuck you.
371.3,372.3, Yeah.
372.3,373.3, Yeah.
373.3,374.3, By the chance or you're getting a shirt.
374.3,378.3, That's the the the the the colors of your game shirts all stretched out.
378.3,382.3, Like it looks like didn't like someone just grabbed it neckline with both hands and try to
382.3,383.3, rip the shirt off your back.
383.3,385.3, Why are you asking that?
385.3,391.3, There's something with like nerds and shitty shirts that like they they always have the collar.
391.3,398.3, Either that or it looks like they're exeter from this plant this what's that old sci-fi show.
398.3,402.3, Which one something this planet earth or something this island earth.
402.3,403.3, Okay.
403.3,406.3, And exeter he has this enormous like hydrocephalus cranium.
406.3,409.3, So the shirts look like maybe that you had to pull the shirt down over that.
409.3,412.3, And then by the time we got it out to their neck was permanently.
412.3,415.3, It's like that's something to look for.
415.3,416.3, Yeah.
416.3,418.3, If you then tucking those things into like sweatpants shorts.
418.3,419.3, I don't know man.
419.3,420.3, I got so many of those shirts.
420.3,421.3, I'm going to screw this guy.
421.3,424.3, It's actually a bit of a problem to have to wear those out.
424.3,426.3, I try not to too much.
426.3,427.3, Yeah.
427.3,432.3, Just if I have to take off the outer shirt and then I'm stuck with some like dumb ass like flaming skull.
432.3,437.3," And I met some like you know one of my kid's schools meetings, you know."
437.3,441.3, I just got a stir dress and like a grown up.
441.3,444.3," Anyway, I'll save this for my next."
444.3,447.3, My next off site.
447.3,449.3, We can yoga therapy such.
449.3,453.3, I don't have to board GFW radio with problems with my t-shirts.
453.3,455.3, You can always turn them inside out.
455.3,456.3, I'm out of there.
456.3,457.3, Yeah.
457.3,464.3, I had a friend who did it all the time with like printed t-shirts like you went to work with a white one that was just turned inside out on like under his dress shirt.
464.3,466.3, And it was very obvious there was like a logo.
466.3,468.3, You could see it like in the neckline.
468.3,470.3," It was like, yeah, you sure you want to wear it?"
470.3,471.3, That's a little cheesy.
471.3,473.3, It was really cheesy for those.
473.3,476.3, He used to not wear it.
476.3,477.3, Game logo shirts.
478.3,479.3, I still don't.
479.3,480.3, I made it.
480.3,485.3, I've been left myself with the team for a shirt because it didn't have logos all over it.
485.3,488.3," It just had like, like, just decent, no, it's great."
488.3,489.3, Cool.
489.3,490.3, So you'll be a horse.
490.3,492.3, You'll just be a classy horse.
492.3,493.3, So what you're saying.
493.3,494.3, Right.
494.3,495.3, Do you have a call?
495.3,497.3, You do at least I like team foragers.
497.3,499.3, You don't like the same as police department.
499.3,502.3," No, I just wear them because they're shirts."
502.3,504.3, I don't know if they'll go buy shirts.
504.3,505.3, I want to do this thing.
505.3,508.90000000000003, I'm still trying to convince there's a connection here with like game
508.90000000000003,509.90000000000003, tragedies.
509.90000000000003,512.9, I'm trying to convince the game videos guys to do a segment on it.
512.9,516.5, But I want to collect all of our old cloth maps from various collectors
516.5,520.3, editions and do like a cloth diaper test with them.
520.3,523.3," You see, see which is the most absorbent."
523.3,524.3, Someone's got to have a baby.
524.3,525.3, Jen's got a baby.
525.3,527.3, I was a couple babies around here.
527.3,529.3, Get a tie around the squid.
529.3,532.3," I want to tell the story about like, you know, giving a bunch of everyone's"
532.3,533.3, out of the game.
533.3,535.3, I want to tell them how I go through the closet and I'll get out of all the game shirts.
535.3,536.3, I'm not wearing anymore.
536.3,537.3, I'll bring them to the goodwill.
537.3,539.3, And then drive around Berkeley.
539.3,542.3, They end up I see them on like the day workers.
542.3,544.3," You know, you have a guy standing on the corner."
544.3,545.3, Like holy shit.
545.3,553.3," It's a, you know, that said you also see like 1986 2K run shirts and stuff on people, you know."
553.3,554.3, Yeah.
554.3,556.3," No, caramel speed climb."
556.3,557.3, All right.
557.3,560.3," Well, so we talk about actual stuff."
561.3,562.3, We should do that.
562.3,566.3," So Sean, we're going to talk about the steamworks stuff."
566.3,570.3, And I can let you just take that away because I was a pretty huge announcement today.
570.3,574.3," Well, first let's, should we start off with the room, the transition."
574.3,575.3, I run the fair.
575.3,576.3, Okay.
576.3,578.3, I'm giving away the transition first.
578.3,582.3, And PD figures for PC sales were recently released.
582.3,584.3, We should have that you should have.
584.3,585.3, We do.
585.3,587.3, I have the number of the front of me.
588.3,589.3, I would start it off.
589.3,598.3," I, I love our website started the article, the MPD number started off with the article started off with is PC gaming dead."
598.3,601.3, Don't do that on our own fucking website.
601.3,602.3, Stop it.
602.3,607.3," If you work if you work here at this site and you're listening to our podcast now, don't do that again."
607.3,608.3, Okay.
608.3,609.3, It's not dead.
609.3,612.3," When when we're recording our last podcast here, then you can type that again."
612.3,613.3, Okay.
613.3,615.3, What's in the statement is a question.
615.3,616.3, Right.
616.3,617.3, God.
617.3,620.3," Oh, then it says of course not in bold face, but okay."
620.3,625.3," Then if it's not, then don't pose the rhetorical question."
625.3,626.3, Dumb shits.
626.3,627.3, Okay.
627.3,628.3, Anyway.
628.3,629.3, I love you guys.
629.3,631.3, You can get in trouble.
631.3,633.3, I don't get to do that.
633.3,634.3, Yeah.
634.3,635.3, I'll just.
635.3,636.3, I said it.
636.3,637.3, There I said it.
637.3,638.3, That's fine.
638.3,640.3, We can have a meeting in my office later.
640.3,641.3, Okay.
641.3,644.3," But anyway, the question was asked because, in fact,"
644.3,652.3," when the NPD released their numbers, it turns out that PC games in North America in 2007 earned"
652.3,656.3, 910.7 million dollars.
656.3,662.3," That is down from 970 million dollars, I believe, in 2006."
662.3,666.3, So a loss of $60 million in sales.
666.3,672.3, And more important when you compare that to console sales.
672.3,677.3," And that is, there was $18.8 billion."
677.3,680.3, It's billion dollars total in North America.
680.3,685.3, Only 910.7 million of that coming from PC games.
685.3,689.3, So that's 14% of all game sales.
689.3,694.3," According to the MPD, we're from PC at retail."
694.3,697.3, And those games are as follows.
697.3,698.3, Number one.
698.3,700.3," Take a guess, Ryan."
701.3,703.3, We're all the warcrafts.
703.3,704.3, What an increase.
704.3,705.3, There you go.
705.3,707.3, 2.25 million.
707.3,708.3, Number two.
708.3,710.3," Take a guess, Ryan."
710.3,712.3, We're all the four crafts.
712.3,713.3, Yes.
713.3,715.3," That's the most amazing thing on here, actually."
715.3,716.3, That's the one and two.
716.3,717.3, That's the base game.
717.3,720.3," And then what a three through seven are like the Sims, right?"
720.3,721.3, Not quite.
721.3,723.3," World Warcraft was 914,000."
723.3,726.3," So actually significantly, according to MPD,"
726.3,729.3," the only game to break in million was World Warcraft,"
729.3,731.3, and that was 2.25 million.
731.3,734.3," Then it goes way down to 900,000."
734.3,735.3, Okay.
735.3,739.3, Then number three was Sims 2 seasons expansion pack.
739.3,742.3, Four was called duty four.
742.3,744.3, Bravo.
744.3,747.3, Number five was command and conquer three.
747.3,749.3, Tybury and wars.
749.3,751.3, Number four was Sim City Deluxe.
751.3,753.3, Sim City Ford Deluxe.
753.3,754.3, Which did that.
754.3,756.3, That didn't even come out in 2007.
757.3,758.3, It came out like 2003.
758.3,759.3, That's wacky.
759.3,761.3, That's wack.
761.3,764.3, That's awkward.
764.3,767.3," And then we're already down in the 200,000s here."
767.3,769.3, We're only at number six.
769.3,771.3, Number seven was the Sims 2.
771.3,775.3, Number eight was Sims 2 Bon Voyage expansion pack.
775.3,777.3, Nine was age vampires.
777.3,778.3, Three.
778.3,779.3, Holden tough.
779.3,781.3, And rounding at the top 10 was Sims 2.
781.3,783.3, Pets expansion pack.
783.3,784.3, Okay.
784.3,786.3, So we're going to have the top 10.
786.3,790.3, You had numbers one and two were World Warcraft.
790.3,793.3, The expansion in the main game and then numbers.
793.3,796.3, Two six seven eight and ten.
796.3,799.3, That's five of the ten were all Sims related.
799.3,804.3, Youngly games that were not wow and Sims were called duty four.
804.3,806.3, CNC and eight of empires.
806.3,809.3, And age of empires again came out.
809.3,811.3, What 2005 and we'll run on.
812.3,813.3, Pretty mediocre hardware.
813.3,815.3, See that's another correct.
815.3,819.3, So that led to the usual.
819.3,823.3, These numbers lots of hand-wringing on both sides of the fence.
823.3,825.3, Is PC gaming dead.
825.3,826.3," No, it's not."
826.3,827.3, And it's either et cetera.
827.3,831.3, The usual disclaimer that digital distribution accounts for.
831.3,835.3, A large number of PC game sales and then furthermore that
835.3,838.3, International that's North America and that international markets.
839.3,842.3, Where you know PC will traditionally do much stronger.
842.3,844.3, They need to be taken in consideration.
844.3,849.3, The thing is is running in PD stories on PC is easy because.
849.3,851.3, And PD numbers are accessible.
851.3,855.3, So we as much as we do complain a little why not run the digital distribution numbers.
855.3,856.3, We don't have them.
856.3,858.3, They're not always all unified people are getting.
858.3,863.3, They're getting their digital content from all over the place from game taps from steam.
863.3,867.3, Sometimes directly from you know from EA sometimes from site savage to.
867.3,870.3, And you know from the site.
870.3,871.3, So you know from the site.
871.3,873.3, So you know from the site.
873.3,875.3, So you know from the site.
875.3,877.3, So until I mean it would be nice.
877.3,879.3, I think that's where you know the interesting in real stories.
879.3,882.3, If you could somehow if we could somehow convince.
882.3,884.3," You know, Val does not go in to give."
884.3,886.3, They traditionally having.
886.3,888.3, Provided figures for their games.
888.3,891.3, It would be super fascinating here how well team fortress two and portal.
891.3,895.3, And episode two sold just this past year as well as recurring sales.
896.3,900.3, And do we know why they don't release those numbers.
900.3,901.3, They ever said.
901.3,903.3, Given an official reason why they don't.
903.3,905.3, Could be their own strategy.
905.3,906.3, Yeah.
906.3,907.3, Some business reason not to do it.
907.3,912.3, But it's weird because you do you want to assume well if you had good news you would share it right.
912.3,914.3, Why would you keep it secreted if it was bad.
914.3,920.3, But at the same time we know for a fact that they they claim over 14 million steam users.
921.3,926.3," You know get those kind of numbers when people are only getting 100,000 copies of a game at a time."
926.3,927.3, You know.
927.3,931.3," You know, we know that half life two did really well."
931.3,936.3, I mean company seemed very very happy with with the way that worked for them.
936.3,941.3, So maybe a one of these days we can get it or third parties can do it say for example.
941.3,946.3, You know like your THQ it's up to them and you have your your game available on steam.
946.3,961.3, You they have access to the sales you know specifically when what month of the year which weeks of the year they they sold the most when they were sudden burst which regions you know they sold in so you can even see.
961.3,974.3, I mean if they put up like a front page thing on steam announcing hey there's a there's a discount like company here isn't a posing front's we're offered together for like a reduced price you know both they can look and see did how much did the sales increase this week.
974.3,980.3, I mean it was it worth it for that that placement on there and this and stuff like that so it's super helpful.
980.3,996.3, So next generations website interviewed valves Doug Lombardi and then also Jason Holtman about the announcement that they're making their tools that they're calling steam works available to any third party that wants them.
996.3,1016.3, It means that for no charge game makers can implement all or some of steam works publishing and development tools such as up to the hour sales tracking encryption system auto updating territory control voice chat multiplayer matchmaking social networking including feature such as achievements and development tools including private betas and QA tools.
1016.3,1037.3, So in all of that voice chat matchmaking that does does seem like obviously attractive features to have along with the sales stuff auto updating is great it means that you're if you're going to patch your game you don't have to worry about people going some people going to file front others going to file planet and others going to your games official website.
1037.3,1056.3, And or finding out that they don't have a patch because they try to join a game and it kicks them back out of the game it's just going to handle it all for you right there in the way that you know steam has has been doing for for all the game all that's valve games you know for so long the action things seems huge too right and that's another way too to I mean.
1056.3,1065.3, So some another category where we don't hear valve talking about how confident that they are in their in steams ability to prevent.
1065.3,1086.3, And I mean there's a big loss for yourself you know you're either going to have to cough up another credit card for not because steam costs money but for I don't know actually it can a lose access to potentially right now and from your own library.
1086.3,1114.3," Yeah, so these are all good and by giving them for absolutely free to developers even like from what I understand even if they're not selling their stuff on steam they want they want you to I mean what they get what valve gets out of this is that ideally the more content there is on steam the more people are going to use it and that's it that's are going for them just to use their service right so theoretically just if I understand it game developer could take steam works here implement all this."
1114.3,1124.3, And actually not be part of steam is that correct. I'll have to get confirmation on that that's okay that's from my initial reading the story that's how I understood it.
1124.3,1153.3, This is huge because it takes away a lot of extra and like counterproductive labor away from the development process for studios so every time you make a multiplayer game it's like you've got a the nuts and bolts shit that you just want to rebut about your game not let's recreate a browser for the fifth time let's figure out another way to integrate voice chat you know yet again and these are exactly the same features that games for windows initiative games windows live initiative is offering.
1153.3,1182.7, So this is a parier initiative by the way I should say so I'm afraid to say this one that the with with games for windows live though we've had all these rumors of you know conditions right we know exactly how it works but we know that there are conditions they might be it seemed there's a lot of back and forth when we're trying to figure out with years of war for PC for example for games for windows if it was mic Microsoft was saying.
1183.3,1205.3, You can't run let people run dedicated servers if you're going to do it this way so then they could I mean that's they put a condition on them they told epic what they couldn't do they also say you have to provide some enticement for gold membership which have to pay for so while you can offer things for free in the silver package you can't give them everything you're going to have to withhold some content from.
1205.3,1207.3, Without any of these.
1207.3,1217.3, You know stipulations and preconditions you can do it now with steam steam for free for yeah and they've got an enormous user base that 14 million.
1217.3,1222.3, So it's it's yet again it's difficult because it's you know valve over and over again.
1222.3,1228.3, Since the announcement of the games for windows initiative it's has been just coming up and saying oh yeah.
1228.3,1234.3, We'll do something like that but free over and over again you know will that she meets two and it's here and it's already.
1234.3,1238.3, Yeah so it's been.
1238.3,1247.3, It's it's they're leading away I think it is a fantastic move on on valve's part the other thing is you know Doug and Barty again quote in from the story.
1247.3,1255.3, He laughs for get the NPD you'll know down to the finest details how many games have sold every hour of the day every day the week and that information isn't real time.
1255.3,1266.3, This is another good asset resource for you know publishers developers everyone have on that in it's kind of I really like though that that they're touting that feature when they themselves never release anything.
1266.3,1273.3, Here's a great tool in which you'll know exactly well I guess no he's saying that you will know they will not that not do you share that information.
1273.3,1287.3, I'm surprised I would like to hear I would like to hear for example how many copies called duty sold you know on this this kind of thing that was got to upset the only.
1287.3,1294.3, I mean I think that's a part of the idea that I can imagine it upsetting aside from like games for windows or direct petters would be retail.
1294.3,1304.3, You know I mean that could be another reason why they don't want maybe this retail pressure not for that doesn't explain valves you know reluctance to talk but maybe activation with call duty.
1304.3,1313.3, Maybe but what then when you look at the retail numbers I mean how much is retail you know investing in PC gaming anyway first place right.
1313.3,1325.3, I think that's a great idea that you can do it right also another quote from the story from Haltman is that it's important to realize that we're not going to become a certification house it's still your game you can do what you want with it put it together how you want use the pieces of steam works that you want from us.
1325.3,1351.3, I mean that again that reads like a direct message to hey you're listening Microsoft yes yeah we know that you've been in discussion with them because Microsoft has been approaching you know all these other you know publishers and stuff and saying hey like let's get on board with us this is what we have to offer you and this is like they're just being under cut by a ostensibly a better offer.
1351.3,1358.3, Yeah you look at these two things on paper you're a game developer why would you not go with steam works at this point.
1358.3,1359.3, Yeah.
1359.3,1369.3, So it'll be interesting so it happens that we're still waiting I'm still waiting on Microsoft to do a few to to sort out the whole.
1370.3,1379.3, Teared access was silver and gold at that they should have made it free from the beginning especially once you know the last time valve sort of kind of undercut the deal was when they announced the steam community.
1379.3,1386.3, They say oh you like friends list and stuff you like all that you like clubs and calendar updates well that's cool we'll throw it in there for you you got it.
1386.3,1397.3, I'm surprised it's taken this long to lead a cure any news about that sort of thing from Microsoft I've been expecting like announcements of some big sweeping change like that.
1397.3,1409.3, I feel like clearly they are in the dark here and you know wood shedding I I'm picturing like you know long tables of you know exact surround.
1409.3,1418.3, You know in a meeting room I don't know with you know slapping themselves with paddle balls or something you know kind of figure out what the what the fuck to do now that steam.
1418.3,1423.3, You want to hear something we've been wanting to hear about a game is for windows live arcade for a long time.
1423.3,1431.3, I mean that makes perfect sense we know how when all the the other things that that do phenomenal phenomenally well on PC platform.
1431.3,1440.3, Are like casual games and stuff yep it's like take all take that library and put it on PC why why don't we have that yet I don't understand that.
1440.3,1450.3, And and all the kind of in various incentives that you could do instead of I mean just be generous in the beginning now take games windows live arcade here's another reason for you to sign up and then.
1450.3,1463.3, Instead of it just being shatter on or gears of war whatever it is you mean create a number of reasons to get a wide variety of people hooked up to the networks that then they can it's exactly what valve is doing so that they can see your range of products and services.
1463.3,1473.3, And become familiar with them that way not just by having one thing now and then that comes out my pony and then and then when you announce when they do announce like games from this library.
1473.3,1486.3, Okay if they do you know like can throw a bunch of games let people hey here's a coupon pick five free games take them any any five you want not here's not here's like frog or get to addition do you want pack man C.E get that right you know you want.
1487.3,1497.3, Yeah and part of me is wondering if that is why it's taking so long because this maybe you know maybe I'm being too generous for to them but like maybe they realize that they came out of the gate so weekly.
1497.3,1510.3, And then beginning they're like okay for going to do this next big step we got to make sure we've got everything lined up and it's such a daunting task line up all of that right yeah this is pretty hard to hope that I'm holding on to here that they have been quiet because when they come out they're going to have some awesome.
1510.3,1512.3, Great.
1512.3,1525.3, You know line up of services yeah all at once instead of SW live will be free there's going to be you know all the arcade stuff monkeys may fly at a rinds but.
1525.3,1542.3, It examples from elsewhere to had it where you can download put in put in video recorder like the sort of unified games windows video recorder like gameplay recorder action so that you can just send it to everyone in your friends list you have like a my space page equivalent you know you can trade videos directly.
1542.3,1549.3, Look at each other's achievements as you can on live already but just like you know go go all out with it.
1549.3,1554.3, Yeah maybe these things are in the works maybe not I hope so I certainly hope there I hope so too.
1554.3,1557.3, Please I don't know if I believe myself but.
1557.3,1562.3, It'd be nice the free the all those things that valve does the free weekends you know.
1562.3,1575.3, The little just make a game right available to everyone for weekends try to see what you think like the guy passes passes yeah you buy and you're trying to get your friend into it it's like well here play you get to play it for a day and then you're going to hopefully it will get sprung on it.
1575.3,1581.3, It's like not being so afraid well that means they're playing for free we can't have him playing for free for eight hours.
1581.3,1594.3, Is that means you know that home entirely it's got to go like it's common business like every it's not even just PC but especially like now like so much stuff is free you can get so many products and services for services you know.
1594.3,1598.3, And digital products for free so.
1598.3,1605.3, Yeah it's going to be even worse like if you know if Google as all these you know sort of forecast that.
1605.3,1618.3, The operating systems we use and the tools like you know we're processors and stuff will all just be based online through Google when things like that and then made free that way then the channel continue and you'll just look like a dinosaur trying to get.
1618.3,1626.3, 99 for some like shady game that is worth it's fun to play for 20 minutes and remember hey that was kind of cool back when.
1626.3,1628.3, You know.
1628.3,1629.3, Yeah.
1629.3,1636.3, Well it's a huge announcement and yeah like he said once again Valve leading the way they're amazing.
1636.3,1642.3, On the Valve note I found out this week that Ryan 30 little secret.
1643.3,1646.3, He got online with Rory.
1646.3,1653.3, Who freely asked us for us friend of mine and talk about him a lot and he told him let's go in the team fortress too.
1653.3,1658.3, Let me shoot you in the head because I'm trying to get a achievements.
1658.3,1659.3, Oh my god.
1659.3,1670.3, And you know what let I just say that right after I said this to him the very next thing I said was I have a feeling this is going to come back to bite me on the next part.
1671.3,1674.3, Of course it was the moment you ordered it to do it.
1674.3,1681.3," Yeah, now you can get him back did he do it because then I could make fun of him if he like he said he would have but he was."
1681.3,1685.3, Do in something else at the time he uses being polite.
1685.3,1688.3," Wait, you heard him in the stand there so you could shoot him in the head so you can hear him."
1688.3,1692.3," Yeah, there's a you're like you're like you're what are you going to glow headshot bitch."
1692.3,1698.3, There's a she made where like he was like you know get 25 headshots.
1698.3,1701.3," And I can't let it she made. Yeah, so you want to that."
1701.3,1706.3, Why do you we're going to cheat to get it because you've gotten game and it was like.
1706.3,1709.3, There's no way I could do that for real.
1709.3,1711.3, So why why do you need it?
1711.3,1714.3, Because there's only three achievements on where this left and then they're all on.
1714.3,1715.3, That was easy.
1715.3,1721.3," Yeah, yeah, should have said well you will be having to know that I'm right here in my hands."
1721.3,1726.3, I'm holding a spoiler list of the forthcoming team fortress to achievements.
1726.3,1728.3, So you're not done now.
1728.3,1730.3, Now it's not just so you have more.
1730.3,1732.3, It's a never ending.
1732.3,1736.3," See, these are have a reason because you actually are locked stuff with these achievements."
1736.3,1738.3, So these are these are brand new.
1738.3,1739.3, This is really.
1739.3,1740.3, This is it soon.
1740.3,1741.3, This is it.
1741.3,1742.3, It's not real exclusive.
1742.3,1744.3, I'll give you the source in a second.
1744.3,1748.3, So one of them is going to give you some examples of some of the things that people can look for.
1748.3,1749.3, Where all takes places.
1749.3,1755.3, There's a high book on react and that's to continually call for a medic when you have no need of one.
1755.3,1757.3, I don't leave.
1757.3,1758.3, That's awesome.
1758.3,1759.3, There's the.
1759.3,1760.3, What?
1760.3,1765.3, Fairground sites and that's the completely miss a heavy as a sniper.
1765.3,1774.3," I mean, he's the engraved invitation and that's to get killed while holding onto a new recharge."
1774.3,1780.3, Conspiracy theorists use the flamethrower and enemy on every one of your teammates without finding an enemy spy.
1781.3,1784.3, And we have fuck this shit.
1784.3,1788.3, And that's you have to rage quit to get it.
1788.3,1789.3," Oh, I do."
1789.3,1790.3," Wait, then also mine."
1790.3,1791.3, That's not really.
1791.3,1792.3," Also, can I get the door for you?"
1792.3,1797.3," You endure marketing, increase the non-game related team chatter once a female voice has heard over voice chat."
1797.3,1798.3, Okay.
1798.3,1801.3, That was totally getting more suspicious.
1801.3,1802.3, Yeah.
1802.3,1804.3," Oh, my."
1806.3,1808.3, There's throwing another shrimp on the barbie.
1808.3,1811.3, I select this sniper class when your team already has two or more snipers.
1811.3,1815.3, And then the master of disguise uses teleporter as a spy.
1815.3,1819.3, But these actually come from something awful.
1819.3,1821.3, That's awesome story.
1821.3,1823.3, Team fortress two achievements.
1823.3,1825.3, Anyone can get they're all fake.
1825.3,1826.3, Of course in the something off.
1826.3,1827.3, You had to go in there.
1827.3,1828.3, I just figured out.
1828.3,1830.3, I was thinking those teams are really easy.
1830.3,1832.3, The an awful good.
1832.3,1833.3, Yeah.
1833.3,1835.3, I was actually mad about that first one for a second.
1835.3,1837.3," I'm like, that's so adorable."
1838.3,1839.3, The manic one.
1839.3,1840.3, Yeah.
1840.3,1841.3, I don't know what people doing that.
1841.3,1842.3, I can't even stand it.
1842.3,1843.3," Oh, I did that."
1843.3,1846.3, There's tons more on there.
1846.3,1849.3, I only read a few of the ones that I don't especially exciting.
1849.3,1850.3, So right.
1850.3,1854.3, I bet you know right off the top of your head which two other achievements played this headshot.
1854.3,1856.3, One you're missing.
1856.3,1862.3, I'm missing the one where you have to kill 10 targets with the same turret.
1862.3,1863.3, Okay.
1863.3,1865.3, And.
1866.3,1868.3, The bang on your century again with the Ranch Award.
1868.3,1870.3, Hahaha.
1870.3,1873.3," Well, can you just set up a server to go do that one?"
1873.3,1877.3," Well, you had to have another person help you because you have to actually kill."
1877.3,1878.3, So you have to open some sucker.
1878.3,1880.3, Which is why I need to very help.
1880.3,1883.3, So we're just shooting yourself in the foot and asking for a purple heart.
1883.3,1884.3, And then.
1884.3,1887.3, You don't even have like that gamer score.
1887.3,1888.3, Yeah.
1888.3,1889.3, Yeah.
1889.3,1890.3, Yeah.
1890.3,1891.3, Yeah.
1891.3,1892.3, You're nice.
1892.3,1893.3, This is bad.
1893.3,1896.3, If you get one of the one up.com interns to do it.
1896.3,1897.3, Like it sucks.
1897.3,1898.3, Some work related.
1898.3,1899.3, That's a service people.
1899.3,1901.3, I wonder if they haven't done it already.
1901.3,1902.3, Maybe so.
1902.3,1903.3, Oh yeah.
1903.3,1905.3," Well, now it's like charge people."
1905.3,1906.3, Yes.
1906.3,1908.3, I can look probably log on tomorrow and people will put my freck just.
1908.3,1909.3, The achievement you will.
1909.3,1910.3, Yeah.
1910.3,1911.3, What achievement.
1911.3,1912.3, Yeah.
1912.3,1913.3, Make.
1913.3,1915.3, You like the term for like drug writers.
1915.3,1916.3, Right.
1916.3,1917.3, Back to cocaine.
1917.3,1918.3, Crap it out.
1918.3,1919.3, Yeah.
1919.3,1920.3, You're all good shot.
1920.3,1921.3, And hit 10 times.
1921.3,1922.3, Yeah.
1922.3,1923.3, Yeah.
1923.3,1926.3, You're in there for Ryan and charging a couple bucks or lindons.
1926.3,1927.3, Second life.
1927.3,1928.3, What the hell Ryan will accept those.
1928.3,1930.3, I'm going to wonder how it is.
1930.3,1931.3, It's kind of a 360 10.
1931.3,1934.3, But I wonder how much extra sales are accounted for simply.
1934.3,1938.3, Because there's games that are notorious for who haven't really easy achievements.
1938.3,1939.3, Like finished level one.
1939.3,1940.3, Right.
1940.3,1941.3, Yeah.
1941.3,1942.3, Yeah.
1942.3,1945.3, And like I wonder how many sales are there just because people like red somewhere that I like.
1945.3,1946.3, Yeah.
1946.3,1948.3, And then jittertles for 360 has the easiest achievements.
1948.3,1949.3, And then it's one of their gamers score up.
1949.3,1950.3, So they'll go bite into turtle.
1950.3,1951.3, I should have said.
1951.3,1955.3, This is kind of made this is also coming back because because I know when last week's
1955.3,1957.3, one of yours she was talking about it.
1957.3,1960.3, But achievement he often does because he is completely.
1960.3,1961.3, It's completely.
1961.3,1962.3, It's the achievement hard.
1962.3,1963.3," Well, I saw him on."
1963.3,1968.3, I was I saw him on an MSN because it will show people that are on Xbox live on there.
1968.3,1969.3, Yeah.
1969.3,1971.3, And he was like playing godfather 360.
1971.3,1973.3, It's like I wonder what that's about.
1973.3,1974.3, Oh yeah.
1974.3,1975.3," He's just like, you know what?"
1975.3,1977.3, This godfather is a good game.
1977.3,1978.3, I thought he needed to finish it.
1978.3,1980.3," And you're like, they aren't going to achievements."
1980.3,1981.3, Yeah.
1981.3,1985.3, So this my my stance on that is I don't know.
1985.3,1986.3, It's sort of an an interest.
1986.3,1987.3, I like getting it.
1987.3,1989.3, So I was wondering I get them.
1989.3,1993.3, But I wouldn't go out of my way to play a game to get achievements.
1993.3,1994.3, Yeah.
1994.3,1995.3, You know what I mean?
1995.3,1999.3," If they come, if I get them, if I'm playing the game and then all of a sudden the game tells"
1999.3,2001.3," me, you just get 20 points for whatever."
2001.3,2002.3, I'm a.
2002.3,2003.3, All right.
2003.3,2004.3, That's okay.
2004.3,2006.3," Well, we're certainly in the minority."
2006.3,2007.3, We are.
2008.3,2009.3," Oh, for sure."
2009.3,2011.3, It's an achievements are increasingly driving.
2011.3,2016.3," Not, I mean, you know, not game sales like, you know, when you're talking about with crappy games,"
2016.3,2020.3, but they're influencing the way that games are made.
2020.3,2023.3," You know, see a four part of it's maybe the sales to you."
2023.3,2025.3," I mean, loaded up with them."
2025.3,2028.3," Battlefield heroes, which we'll talk about soon."
2028.3,2033.3," Same thing there, you know, you get something every time you play."
2033.3,2035.3, You feel like you.
2035.3,2037.3," You want to say that, you know, the back, I guess."
2037.3,2038.3," Yeah, yeah."
2038.3,2040.3," Get that palette for a poop sock, well-filled."
2040.3,2041.3, Yeah.
2041.3,2043.3, Oh.
2043.3,2046.3, What's that talk about the hot balls over the podcast?
2046.3,2047.3, And yeah.
2047.3,2048.3, Too much.
2048.3,2049.3," Yeah, yeah, we can."
2049.3,2054.3," We, when I hit up some of the stuff that we've been playing, got some variety there."
2054.3,2055.3, We do.
2055.3,2058.3," I've been playing Sins of a Solar Amper, for you."
2058.3,2059.3, But I don't know if I can talk about it.
2059.3,2061.3, So I think we're going to say that for next week.
2061.3,2062.3, So why did they bring it up?
2062.3,2064.3, Because I wanted to say Sins of MC solar is a wrap empire.
2064.3,2065.3, That's why brought it up.
2065.3,2066.3, Thank you.
2066.3,2070.3, So I'm going to turn you back into the MC solar is.
2070.3,2073.3," Like, MC solar was on the, oh, the gangster record."
2073.3,2075.3, That's why the AKA guru really?
2075.3,2077.3," Oh, see, solar was on there."
2077.3,2080.3," Yeah, I got a few French hip-hop tracks of my, okay."
2080.3,2083.3, Fictive up awesome random parkour video.
2083.3,2086.3, For you running.
2086.3,2091.3," Gemly Rob, front say, say, train bone."
2092.3,2093.3, Okay.
2093.3,2095.3, How can I access that?
2095.3,2096.3, Yeah.
2096.3,2097.3, Yeah.
2097.3,2099.3, So Sins of a Solar Amper.
2099.3,2101.3," Yeah, I guess maybe we have to talk about that next week."
2101.3,2103.3," Yeah, but I was, I played."
2103.3,2105.3, I actually played this on PS3.
2105.3,2107.3, I'll tell you that right now.
2107.3,2109.3, As the demo for the club.
2109.3,2113.3, Which is a game that was like just so not even on my radar.
2113.3,2114.3," I was like, okay."
2114.3,2116.3, So some guys with some guns and some around.
2116.3,2120.3, Same after alcoholic cocktails and the kid sold in the can.
2121.3,2123.3, So I'm talking about heck of club you seen those.
2123.3,2125.3," No club dude, come on man."
2125.3,2127.3, You never been in a radio liquor store.
2127.3,2131.3, There's like a giant martini or a margarita and a can.
2131.3,2133.3, Really the brand that club.
2133.3,2134.3, Ugh.
2134.3,2135.3, Wow.
2135.3,2138.3, I guess you guys never been to a liquor store.
2138.3,2142.3," Now, considering that there's 20 of them within the square mile of where we both live."
2142.3,2143.3, Get lottery tickets there.
2143.3,2144.3, So it worked.
2144.3,2146.3, I play my scratch off.
2146.3,2147.3, We get about 25.
2147.3,2148.3, Lot of retickets.
2148.3,2150.3, I don't know if I can play a lottery.
2150.3,2151.3, So club.
2151.3,2152.3, So the club.
2152.3,2153.3," So yeah, it's coming out for PC2."
2153.3,2154.3, That's why I'm working this up.
2154.3,2155.3, But it's.
2155.3,2165.3, It's weird because we always talk about shooter design and like how big flashing arrows on the ground are ridiculous and how like people who are coming around the same corner every single time.
2165.3,2166.3, It's ridiculous.
2166.3,2171.3, But this is like what this game is all about and it just openly acknowledges it and says that's what this game is all about.
2171.3,2174.3, You have to memorize this course basically.
2174.3,2179.3," You know, it's like shooting gallery and like try to get try to get your score really high."
2179.3,2181.3, It's it's purely like that.
2181.3,2183.3, So it's like perfect mentality.
2183.3,2195.3, Where you're just trying to like get headshots and time everything right and you have to you know that you want to turn over to the left here because there's this call icon here and you can only have five seconds before your next target pops out.
2195.3,2196.3, You have to refresh your timer.
2196.3,2198.3, It's totally that and I was obsessed over.
2198.3,2200.3, So you just replay like these.
2200.3,2203.3, That's the five minute levels over and over again trying to like.
2203.3,2205.3, Just get better and better at it.
2205.3,2206.3," You know, stupid."
2206.3,2209.3, But like Pac man is the flattering way to go around it like.
2209.3,2210.3, Chey.
2210.3,2211.3, He's story one up.
2211.3,2212.3, He's he's now.
2212.3,2214.3, We're going to the fours a team.
2214.3,2219.3, He had the same sort of way of justifying perfect dark zero.
2219.3,2220.3, What?
2220.3,2221.3, Why he liked it.
2221.3,2226.3, But it was always interesting to me that again it comes back to like the comparisons will be contra our Pac man or these other games.
2226.3,2227.3, Right.
2227.3,2228.3, All agree on but for me it's like.
2228.3,2229.3, You remember Mad Dog McCree.
2229.3,2230.3, Yes.
2230.3,2232.3, We shot Johnny Rock.
2232.3,2234.3, I do like you're describing that to me.
2234.3,2237.3, I am just far more than you're describing you know Pac man.
2237.3,2245.3, I think the key was that I just this one for some reason had whatever it was that hooked me and I don't know what difference is between that the shitty version of this but.
2245.3,2247.3, But it was one of those download on a whim things.
2247.3,2249.3," And I was like, oh, let's try this one out."
2249.3,2250.3, I also don't want to try.
2250.3,2252.3," Oh, how's that?"
2252.3,2253.3, What's again?
2253.3,2254.3, There's no score.
2254.3,2261.3, That's really it none of this like shoot a guy so that he's bleeding and then maybe a dinosaur will run out and get them because you I guess the hook was that you could shoot.
2261.3,2270.3, You could shoot flares of things like at people to like direct the dinosaur towards him most of the time it's basically so it's like bug bait and half like two kind of.
2270.3,2271.3, Toro.
2271.3,2272.3, Hopes brings eternal though.
2272.3,2275.3, There was like so many threads about to rock was going to be good.
2275.3,2279.3, That whole franchise is I don't get it.
2279.3,2281.3, So over my head was always like shit.
2281.3,2287.3, It was kind of like at the time when the original one came out for a 64 was like one of the.
2287.3,2288.3, Did that come out before gold night?
2288.3,2289.3, It did.
2289.3,2290.3, Yeah.
2290.3,2291.3, That was like the first.
2291.3,2292.3, It was like the first.
2292.3,2293.3, It was like the first.
2293.3,2295.3, The US FPS controls and the funky way.
2295.3,2298.3," So, but it was funky wasn't it like and what you just said."
2298.3,2299.3, It was just.
2299.3,2300.3, It was funky.
2300.3,2301.3, You said it's funky.
2301.3,2302.3, It's funky.
2302.3,2303.3, Imagine.
2303.3,2304.3, That's for fresh.
2304.3,2305.3, The direction that right the D pad.
2305.3,2316.3," Yeah, using the D pad in a capacity of a mouse or right analog stick and then having platforming sequences that are like as technical as anything in their original half life."
2316.3,2320.3, I don't know how well I know how because I was young.
2320.3,2322.3, How how I stuck with it.
2322.3,2323.3, I stuck with it.
2323.3,2324.3, I beat that game.
2324.3,2325.3, So today.
2325.3,2328.3, I mean looking back at stupid but.
2328.3,2333.3, But at the time it was kind of like wow I can play this on my console and it actually kind of works.
2333.3,2334.3, Doesn't really work.
2334.3,2337.3, I mean we played gold night to death too and had.
2337.3,2338.3, Yeah.
2338.3,2339.3, And that's certainly not.
2339.3,2341.3, But it didn't have like platforming.
2341.3,2342.3, Well that's true.
2342.3,2344.3, Not a long those lines.
2345.3,2346.3, That we get to hear.
2346.3,2348.3, Or just like don't want to also download the terrain.
2348.3,2349.3, All right.
2349.3,2350.3, So I don't know.
2350.3,2357.3, And they just maybe want to try both and the piece well and maybe not to rock with the other one on the PC because the PS3 controller is.
2357.3,2361.3, Even worse than the Xbox 360 controller for shooters.
2361.3,2364.3, I mean neither one of them is good but the PS3 one is just like.
2364.3,2368.3, He just deserves for me for that genre of game on that system because.
2368.3,2371.3, The sticks I think come up they're a little longer.
2372.3,2375.3, And that causes them to you know they're looser to me.
2375.3,2379.3, They're they're longer and looser and then of course they have the you know.
2379.3,2381.3, The nob instead of a thumb cup.
2381.3,2382.3, Like I.
2382.3,2385.3, The 360 controller and halo like I can.
2385.3,2391.3, I can it takes a little longer to be get a precise shot but I can do it like with the three with the PS3 when I just feel like.
2391.3,2392.3, I'm all over the place.
2392.3,2398.3, I really don't like it yet and immediately gives their it immediately gives this field to the entire experience.
2398.3,2400.3, That that sort of cheap and the whole thing for me.
2400.3,2403.3, I felt that way when I tried to play resistance for PS3.
2403.3,2409.3, And yet it's just it just feels flimsy and cheesy and even though it's very much as controller.
2409.3,2412.3," It's not the game, you know, right not the hardware or anything."
2412.3,2414.3, It's just I can't get over it.
2414.3,2421.3, I've always you know given the option especially in the PS2 Xbox one area between playing a shooter on either one of those controllers.
2421.3,2426.3, I always preferred the Xbox one outside of the one that was the giant enormous you know.
2426.3,2432.3, The what of underground rapper I think he was I'm going to get it wrong.
2432.3,2442.3," It was either ACL owner, Merz called the Malcolm X box because he was convinced that the original controller was made for his hands being a very you know large handed black man."
2442.3,2446.3, Outside of that controller I liked it.
2446.3,2449.3, That was the most gigantic controller ever.
2449.3,2452.3, That was the most ridiculous controller ever outside.
2452.3,2456.3, Well no it was up there with like the Atari Jaguar.
2456.3,2462.3," I got small hands and I remember feeling like a kid holding that thing you know, it was so big."
2462.3,2468.3, And it was a combination of the button layout of the oval vertically oriented oval buttons.
2468.3,2474.3," Yeah, I mean that that just was horrible and the stakes the place and the whole thing was just gross."
2474.3,2476.3, And the and the box itself.
2476.3,2478.3, That's box itself.
2478.3,2482.3," It's kind of stupid. Yeah, it's looking thing. Yeah, that's true."
2482.3,2486.3," Well, it's can we bash on Microsoft."
2486.3,2490.3," Are you guys interested in that no more heroes, by the way."
2490.3,2492.3, Very.
2492.3,2496.3," I was just thinking about that in terms of controllers and I tried looking for it this weekend, but I couldn't find it anywhere."
2496.3,2502.3," Yeah, I've like to try it. I'm skeptical because I know the guys who made killer seven,"
2502.3,2504.3, which is stylistically was really cool.
2504.3,2508.3, The game I ended up when I played that game anyone else you're playing.
2508.3,2514.3, I didn't. I thought it was like this concept piece and the whole thing was there to prove that.
2514.3,2520.3," No matter what you do with an interface, people can figure a game out."
2520.3,2526.3," No, no matter how physically and visually bizarre a game is and just no matter how like"
2526.3,2530.3, completely unintelligible it seems.
2530.3,2536.3," If the interface and the basic moveset is familiar to you, you could figure anything out."
2536.3,2540.3," Yes. And it was like, well, they proved that point, but it was like, yeah, but it's boring and annoying."
2540.3,2542.3," You know, I don't know. I mean, right."
2542.3,2546.3," I mean, the game was mostly about seeing what crazy shit's next. It wasn't about the way."
2546.3,2554.3, Yeah. So maybe it did have some really some kind of disturbing and had it had some cool qualities to it.
2554.3,2558.3," Well, what the the game, the way that the game played. So."
2558.3,2562.3, Can some of that end endless ocean to thinking about.
2562.3,2564.3, Is that what that's called? Yeah.
2564.3,2568.3," The name wrong. See, there's another one we're like, there's no game there."
2568.3,2570.3," Yeah, but that's still counts. It's compelling. Okay."
2570.3,2574.3, With that. It is wrong. There's the big of course. There's this big.
2574.3,2580.3," The game age forms the big blowback for something I guess Chris Bitten said,"
2580.3,2586.3," you know, like the E. J.M. decided that they weren't going to review it, that they're doing a wrap up on it because it wasn't a game or something."
2586.3,2588.3, I didn't even read the original story so I can't say.
2588.3,2596.3," Everyone's freaking out and it becomes just the latest case to Crusade and say how, you know, how wrong game people who write about games for"
2596.3,2602.3," a living aren't stuff. But the funny thing to point out, there is that on the other hand, you have these people saying how"
2602.3,2608.3," forward thinking and revolutionary it is. And of course, the first thing when I read it was like, oh, shit,"
2608.3,2613.3," I, it would have been so long ago that I played the game that I forgot what it was called."
2613.3,2617.3," I wasn't thinking of, you know, like ever blue and stuff, but it was an opportunity."
2617.3,2619.3," I was about to say, yes, but I was exactly like that."
2619.3,2623.3, And I remember running it and go to the dolphin is what I thought of the medium.
2623.3,2627.3," No, I'm going to tell you the same thing. It was just like, you are exploring the ocean. There's nothing else to it."
2627.3,2630.3," It could dolphin is very much, that's a game."
2630.3,2631.3," Yeah, no, there was a chance to."
2631.3,2634.3, I did it into like an aquatic medium.
2634.3,2637.3," Right. It's like, I'm going to tell you about."
2638.3,2641.3," Diving down and if you see a shell, just taking a look at it."
2641.3,2643.3," Oh, it's a lot of times exactly."
2643.3,2644.3, It's exactly exactly.
2644.3,2648.3," Yeah, except like not nearly as nice looking because it was P.S. wanted to come."
2648.3,2649.3, Yeah.
2649.3,2653.3," At the time it was cool because the whole 3D, at the time, you know, when like jumping, was it jumping"
2653.3,2655.3, Jack flash jumping flash jumping flash.
2655.3,2656.3, It came out.
2656.3,2660.3," It was like, it was a 3D game at a time when 3D was such a novelty."
2660.3,2661.3," It was like, this is cool."
2661.3,2662.3, Same with the first borehawk.
2662.3,2664.3," Yeah, all those games."
2664.3,2665.3, It was the end.
2665.3,2667.3, That pretty much caught a left to.
2667.3,2672.3," That's why I think I've done this flip on on like, I've been playing my DS a lot more than"
2672.3,2673.3, PSP.
2673.3,2675.3, I haven't turned my PSP on in a long time.
2675.3,2679.3, And I sort of anticipated this at the time when PSP hardware came out.
2679.3,2683.3, It was that it's stayed at the yard for a handheld.
2683.3,2684.3, Mm-hmm.
2684.3,2688.3, But it's like the epitome of first gen 3D graphics stuff.
2688.3,2689.3, And like almost all those.
2689.3,2692.3, I played two things ever on my PSP.
2692.3,2693.3, One is luminous.
2693.3,2699.3, And the other is fucking spy the spider man movie that came on the UMD that came with
2699.3,2700.3, the thing.
2700.3,2701.3, That's all I've ever played.
2701.3,2703.3," Yeah, well, those are the luminous is great."
2703.3,2704.3," Yeah, but I didn't need."
2704.3,2707.3, I needed their hated software for PSP for sure.
2707.3,2711.3, But I think a lot of it is this crap.
2711.3,2717.3," And I think just because we're still seeing really nice 3D games, it's easier for to look"
2717.3,2719.3, at a quality 2D game on a DS.
2719.3,2721.3, And I know DS does do 3D as well.
2721.3,2723.3, But to look at it and say that's great.
2723.3,2726.3, It doesn't because they didn't think it's never really got that much further beyond this
2726.3,2727.3, point.
2727.3,2730.3," That's not how I guilt the year and stuff, you know."
2730.3,2731.3, That looks great.
2731.3,2736.3, Whereas now you look at a shot of PC thing that while although impressive technically
2736.3,2741.3," for the technological constraints of a handheld platform, it still looks like butt."
2741.3,2744.3," Yeah, I don't know."
2744.3,2748.3," On the handheld though, I just I did pick up a fan of my class finally."
2748.3,2752.3," Yeah, that was interesting to be able to get a Zelda game this late."
2752.3,2754.3," Because it's been out for a long time, right?"
2754.3,2758.3," And traditionally for me, Zelda would be like the first thing you get when it comes out."
2758.3,2760.3, Did you pre-order it that kind of thing?
2760.3,2761.3, Mm-hmm.
2761.3,2764.3, And it reminded me the whole experience of playing Zelda games of ours reminded me.
2764.3,2769.3," I mean, it's making me want to look at it through the comic book lens yet again."
2769.3,2771.3, And it's tend to do that a lot.
2771.3,2774.3," Not just me, but a lot of us look at things through the comic book lens."
2774.3,2782.3," In this case, it's like, you know, you have this period when you go to the comic store every week and you have to get something."
2782.3,2784.3, And then you get past this.
2784.3,2786.3," And then you say, well, I'll just, I don't have to do that."
2786.3,2788.3, Maybe I'll go once a reform month or something.
2788.3,2790.3, And I'll check out the trade paperbacks and things.
2790.3,2795.3," And so with console games now because I don't write about them so often, that's where I'm at."
2795.3,2799.3," I mean, go into the comic store once a reform month find the very best things and be like,"
2799.3,2800.3," Oh, cool."
2800.3,2803.3," There's like a sequel to Dark Knight or whatever, you know, like that sounds cool."
2803.3,2808.3," And where's, you know, before it, you know, when I worked at E. J."
2808.3,2810.3," And where something gets like play console games all time,"
2810.3,2811.3, playing that the moment they come out.
2811.3,2813.3," So that was nice to take it back and be like, you know what?"
2813.3,2814.3, Just added the blue.
2814.3,2816.3, I'm going home tonight with a new Zelda game.
2816.3,2817.3, That's cool.
2817.3,2818.3, It wasn't like this wrong.
2818.3,2820.3, Wait for it and get it that moment.
2820.3,2823.3, Then the other comic book lens aspect is just the fact it's Zelda.
2823.3,2830.3, It's so much like Batman in a way that this story is told over and over again.
2830.3,2834.3, How many times have we read or viewed the Batman origin story?
2834.3,2838.3," Some iteration of it, you know, like, and Batman begins the movie just came out."
2838.3,2840.3, There's yet another take on it.
2840.3,2842.3, There's another set of artists on it.
2842.3,2846.3," It's going to look differently, but you're still waiting for the point when it gets his"
2846.3,2848.3, battering and as utility belt and what's in it.
2848.3,2853.3," Yep, Zelda is going to get his boomerang and some other tricks for his utility belt."
2853.3,2857.3," You know, and you don't see like with so many other series, there's always,"
2857.3,2860.3," here's a sequel or whatever, a prequel or something."
2860.3,2865.3," And it's like it's just so unapologetically like, yeah, here's the, though, though reference that, you know,"
2865.3,2872.3," there's this weird embedded dream theme too, where it's like this Zelda adventure is like some kind of a"
2872.3,2877.3," dream of another one and then in the sequel, the other characters allude to that thing."
2877.3,2882.3," But then only like when you start off fan of our glass, it starts retelling the story of,"
2882.3,2885.3," what was the subtitle for the game, he was the other."
2885.3,2889.3," The way Greg and way because it starts telling that story and you're like, oh, this is a sequel to win"
2889.3,2893.3," Waker and then the guy's like just kidding, and it turns out he's just, yes,"
2893.3,2897.3," some story book and then then the Tetra who's supposed to, you know,"
2897.3,2901.3," discovered is actually Prince of Zelda comes out and goes like, all right,"
2901.3,2905.3," enough with the dumb stories and stuff and it's like, it's like a weird way of acknowledging that these"
2905.3,2909.3," things exist, but no, really we're just going to start this all over again."
2909.3,2910.3, Yeah.
2910.3,2914.3," Yeah, just reminded me a lot not just Batman, but so many, you know, comic book stories where"
2914.3,2918.3," I think I'm going to stick a hearing about Batman's origin story at this point,"
2918.3,2922.3," but right now it's actually disappointing if they like break from the mold to like,"
2922.3,2924.3," well, you kind of know where's where's my claw hook?"
2924.3,2928.3," No, you wait for, right, in the Batman stories, I mean, it's always sort of important,"
2928.3,2932.3," like, how are they going to forget to do the necklace falling off her,"
2932.3,2934.3," offer, you know,"
2934.3,2940.3," for neck when when that when the muggers come, you know, those are like iconic moments."
2940.3,2942.3," Right. You have to experience, right?"
2942.3,2944.3, But the villains are some joy in that too.
2944.3,2945.3, That's true.
2945.3,2946.3," Yeah, who's doing what?"
2946.3,2950.3," It is, yeah, even also like the oral story storytelling tradition before the,"
2950.3,2956.3," you know, where there's something that people enjoy in knowing the general"
2956.3,2957.3, contours of the story.
2957.3,2958.3, Sure.
2958.3,2960.3," And it's like, what are you going to do?"
2960.3,2962.3," Jazz a y'all, so, you know, make too many and I'll just hear,"
2962.3,2965.3," but like, where, you know, I'm familiar with enough of this,"
2965.3,2968.3," and then the interesting stuff's going to be on how you tweak it,"
2968.3,2972.3," while keeping the underlying framework the same and hitting those points,"
2972.3,2975.3," where you get the boom rang and you hold it up over your head,"
2975.3,2977.3," or the bead falls off or when Batman first, you know,"
2977.3,2979.3, drives out of the cave and the bat will be all.
2979.3,2982.3," Right. And like, like, in Zelda, like,"
2982.3,2985.3," they always introduce the main villain and it's never Ganon,"
2985.3,2988.3," but of course, as soon as you seem, you're like, he's going to be Ganon's going to be."
2988.3,2989.3, Yeah.
2989.3,2990.3, Every time.
2990.3,2993.3," Well, I felt that way playing Super Mario Galaxy, too."
2993.3,2997.3," Like, you know, they hit, I mean, you're right."
2997.3,3000.3," I mean, this is more to drop on and tell them, but still on Mario,"
3000.3,3003.3," that the same, wow, it's this plot yet again."
3003.3,3004.3, Right.
3004.3,3006.3, But there's something very nice about that.
3006.3,3009.3," You know, there's something like, yeah, it's just like this unabashed."
3009.3,3012.3," Here's, we're telling this story again this way."
3012.3,3014.3," Now, it's exactly an intendous."
3014.3,3016.3, It's just the way they've been doing it.
3016.3,3019.3," You know, I played some universe at war."
3020.3,3023.3, Not so much. I just started doing some of the campaign.
3023.3,3024.3, Mm-hmm.
3024.3,3026.3," And my response there was, like, oh, this is cool."
3026.3,3028.3," There might be universe at war's,"
3028.3,3030.3, Sega's RTS has a petroglyph.
3030.3,3031.3, A petroglyph.
3031.3,3033.3," Yeah, it has three, you know,"
3033.3,3037.3," Wow, many extra factions, which is pretty much the norm."
3037.3,3040.3," I mean, if it's not three, maybe it's 11, like in,"
3040.3,3041.3, that's for Ganon Wars.
3041.3,3042.3, That's for 11.
3042.3,3043.3, Yeah.
3043.3,3044.3," Yeah. Actually, with the latest expansion,"
3044.3,3046.3," Don't know, we're going to love in Soul Star 9."
3046.3,3047.3, Yeah.
3047.3,3048.3, 11's better than the other.
3048.3,3049.3, Don't forget.
3049.3,3052.3, It's more to eight more.
3052.3,3054.3," I know it comes to a point where you wonder, like,"
3054.3,3057.3," I'm now, I even playing company here as there's four factions at this point."
3057.3,3058.3, There's three of them that I play.
3058.3,3061.3, One of them that I play with total confidence.
3061.3,3063.3," One, I feel kind of nervous of the other."
3063.3,3065.3," Or I just, like, I still have yet to learn it."
3065.3,3066.3, Mm-hmm.
3066.3,3068.3," So, God, you got to wonder when you got to eleven."
3068.3,3071.3," Not only that, but what you have to rebalance the game every single time."
3071.3,3072.3, Yep.
3072.3,3075.3," Um, so to universe at war,"
3076.3,3079.3," I like the concepts, you know, when you see a walker come out and you're like,"
3079.3,3080.3," Oh, it's got all these hard points on it."
3080.3,3083.3, They chicken upgrade with individual weapons and things like this.
3083.3,3084.3, Right.
3084.3,3087.3," Or you can put a, like, a unit producing pot on there and stick it."
3087.3,3088.3, Yeah.
3088.3,3089.3, And all that stuff look cool.
3089.3,3090.3, But then isn't playing it.
3090.3,3093.3," The first thing I noticed is, you know,"
3093.3,3094.3," every time you click on and you need,"
3094.3,3096.3, you hear something like annoying and dumb.
3096.3,3099.3," You know, like, makes you not want to click on a unit anymore."
3099.3,3101.3," What do you mean, like, a sound like an arrow through time?"
3101.3,3102.3, Yeah.
3102.3,3103.3, That guy is small to you.
3103.3,3105.3," Well, whatever you like, same with what workcraft to click on."
3105.3,3107.3, I'm going to go into a group or whatever.
3107.3,3109.3," Oh, instead of that, yeah, imagine like,"
3109.3,3111.3, There's a touch later.
3111.3,3112.3, It's down.
3112.3,3114.3, But stuff to say is like an annoying and dumb.
3114.3,3117.3," And that started, that immediately turned my mind back to,"
3117.3,3118.3, to company here.
3118.3,3120.3," I was like, wow, like the sound is so good."
3120.3,3121.3, In company here.
3121.3,3123.3," You know, like there's, you never like shut up."
3123.3,3125.3," Instead, you're like, I know, you can hear like,"
3125.3,3128.3, creaking wheels coming and you can tell the difference between the type of
3128.3,3132.3, half track it's coming or the type of tank or if it's a galayeth or something.
3132.3,3133.3, The things that guys say are cool.
3133.3,3136.3," I mean, they swear a lot, but it's got like a good vibe to it."
3136.3,3138.3," You can imagine, you know, like soldiers on it."
3138.3,3139.3, So I kept playing it.
3139.3,3144.3," And I absolutely found myself in, it wasn't fair for the game because I'm so"
3144.3,3146.3, adapted to company here.
3146.3,3150.3," I was now, but it reminded me a lot of like when so-called or one came out."
3150.3,3153.3," And at the time, I knew tech was good."
3153.3,3155.3," And I like virtual fighters, well,"
3155.3,3158.3," but I was so into the way that the eight way run,"
3158.3,3161.3, which is basically using the entire 3D surface when you're fighting rather than just
3161.3,3165.3, to like essentially fighting on a 2D plane and being able to side step
3165.3,3169.3," now and then, which is how it's long worked in tech and in virtual"
3169.3,3171.3," fighters, especially at the point when so-called,"
3171.3,3174.3," where came out and then the guard impacts system, you know,"
3174.3,3177.3, their solution to pairing rather than just reverse or
3177.3,3179.3, some stuff like that.
3179.3,3182.3," And at the time when I played as it was all about so-called,"
3182.3,3184.3," there's like shit, I would love it if they made tech and it's like"
3184.3,3186.3," basically tech and but it was so-called,"
3186.3,3188.3," then plays like so-called, I'd love that."
3188.3,3191.3," So now, being so into company here,"
3191.3,3196.3, there's another people have told me and I've talked before about how I didn't have the biggest frame of reference for other RTSs
3196.3,3200.3," to say exactly if someone's like, well, why is it so much better than this game?"
3200.3,3203.3," And now I'm starting to know because I try and like, oh, yeah,"
3203.3,3207.3," like if they don't have these features, they seem bland and sort of RK."
3207.3,3210.3," And those would be that, you know,"
3210.3,3213.3," maybe you crank out a whole bunch of units,"
3213.3,3216.3," you just last so I'm put them into a command group and then when you're going to fight,"
3216.3,3220.3, you just click on the other army and you know like whatever the rock paper scissors parameters
3220.3,3225.3," and the combined by the number of units, you know, the discrepancy and population,"
3225.3,3227.3, it'll just sort itself out.
3227.3,3231.3, Your robots will win the little aliens or something.
3231.3,3233.3," Whereas, you know, company heroes,"
3233.3,3238.3," even though there's a balance and it goes back and forth in so many ways,"
3238.3,3243.3," it's so much more complex and that you might have an anti-infantry vehicle,"
3243.3,3248.3, like a flagpansor anti-aircraft gun you turn the guns toward the ground and shoot an infantry.
3248.3,3249.3, It's great.
3249.3,3250.3, Just rip some up.
3250.3,3252.3, But it doesn't mean your infantry is just useless.
3252.3,3254.3," You might have sticky bombs, you might have smoke grenades,"
3254.3,3258.3," maybe you could pop a smoke grenade, run around the side and throw sticky bombs on it,"
3258.3,3261.3," or you could take cover and then because your position and cover,"
3261.3,3264.3," and it's not just like, it will have different, you know,"
3264.3,3268.3," red for wheat cover, yellow for decent and green for great cover."
3268.3,3271.3," But when you play along enough, you don't even pay attention that you can just tell."
3271.3,3274.3, That looks like good cover that sure enough it always is.
3274.3,3280.3," So you go there, use that and then fight it out long enough to get something in there that can fight it and turn the tide."
3280.3,3283.3," And then when you're fighting the positioning of all the vehicles matters,"
3283.3,3286.3," it's not just this, this mob is fighting this mob."
3286.3,3288.3," It's like, are you hitting it from the back from the side?"
3288.3,3295.3, Can you get yourself an opportunity to hit it from the back by throwing something by fainting in the front and then working around it?
3295.3,3299.3," So all that, you know, our guess is that you have some of the features that you're talking about."
3299.3,3303.3," Well, the universe and worry, even when you're talking about, you know, your infantry aren't,"
3303.3,3304.3, they don't become useless.
3304.3,3308.3," I found myself building almost every type of thing the whole way through because, like, the lost ones,"
3308.3,3311.3," which are just your little grunts, do have these bombs that are really useful for just like running and"
3311.3,3314.3," and kind of suicide, but also blowing up a large thing."
3314.3,3318.3," So they all had that, even like the centuries, which are in a lot of you try the Missari,"
3318.3,3319.3, how far you got in it.
3319.3,3325.3," But like, it's pretty early vehicle unit, but it has one of the few non-projectile weapons."
3325.3,3328.3," It's like this focused laser beam, and there's a specific turret."
3328.3,3335.3," That the bar of the anime robots build it, blocking on their name, some of the powers like that."
3335.3,3336.3, That is.
3336.3,3340.3," It's one of the few things that can destroy it because otherwise this turret,"
3340.3,3342.3, heroles with your projectiles back at you.
3342.3,3344.3, So this is because it's a beam.
3344.3,3346.3, So there's stuff like that. There's lots of little matchups like that.
3346.3,3349.3, It does not have the positional star.
3349.3,3351.3, It does not really have what you're talking about.
3351.3,3353.3, You never get to put units in like a building.
3353.3,3356.3," There's none of the positional stuff you're talking about, though."
3356.3,3357.3, That's very limited in that regard.
3357.3,3367.3," The other thing that, the other element is, it's like, this is where you're going to say it's a better and see how it turns basically every unit in the game into the equivalent of a hero."
3367.3,3370.3," In the universe of war, in company heroes."
3370.3,3375.3," Because the longer you fight with every got, well, depending on the army, they gain better and see different ways."
3375.3,3377.3," But say for example, you have some engineers."
3377.3,3382.3," And if they're in the game the whole time, and they get like level three better and see, then they become super useful."
3382.3,3383.3, And you never want to lose them.
3383.3,3386.3, You always want to treat them and heal them up and bring them back and you don't have that big shield.
3386.3,3389.3, That makes you attached more to every single unit.
3389.3,3390.3, You never feel anything expendable.
3390.3,3391.3, No.
3391.3,3392.3, Yeah.
3392.3,3393.3, They don't do that.
3393.3,3396.3," They mean you have three hero units that you can buy, but none of them really level up."
3396.3,3399.3, And you have like tech trees where you'd love to move on.
3399.3,3404.3, Dawn of the war has always had the the veteran see and that I think.
3404.3,3407.3," Now the hero units of warcraft three did, but I'll think they've brought units."
3407.3,3409.3," No, it's just the heroes of the hero."
3409.3,3410.3, Yeah.
3410.3,3411.3, Some sure that's where that idea came from.
3411.3,3415.3, But they took it to another level with making it more than just your hero units.
3415.3,3421.3, So I think the other thing is they keep trying resources are handled because like in the starcraft kind of game you have distinct.
3421.3,3426.3, Maps are built with distinct like here is a gold mine and we're going to build a little.
3426.3,3432.3," You know, the terrain around it is strategically designed to have some scourmer show with this gold mine and then this going to be."
3432.3,3436.3," You know, hard to defend this point because we have paths in these places."
3436.3,3442.3," So universe of war, you got three factions and each one handles resources really differently."
3443.3,3445.3, So you have one who just does the total annihilation thing.
3445.3,3450.3, If you just be plocked down an energy maker and it just constantly generates energies energy.
3450.3,3453.3, So you don't have to worry about going to get these things.
3453.3,3455.3, So if you're playing against.
3455.3,3458.3," Like the the Walker guys, the hierarchy."
3458.3,3463.3, They just send out drones that just suck up everything like scrap metal on the ground where there was a battle.
3463.3,3465.3," So to me, there like there was no."
3465.3,3467.3, There was where the everyone's so wild.
3467.3,3471.3," It happened, but there was really no like other than the main bases."
3471.3,3473.3, There was really no like fight for.
3473.3,3474.3, Fight for the story.
3474.3,3480.3," Yeah, that's the territory grab just wasn't there because it seems like all of those despite them seeming different."
3480.3,3485.3, All of their resource gathering for the the factions universe at war basically automatic.
3485.3,3491.3," You just create an item and then gather resources for you informally throughout the rest of the match, right."
3491.3,3496.3, The hierarchy make these drones that you can set to just go auto gather and they'll go walk over to a house and suck it up.
3496.3,3498.3," Yeah, but walk over to people and suck it up."
3498.3,3499.3, And suck it up.
3499.3,3500.3, And suck it up.
3500.3,3502.3, People over as the anime robots.
3502.3,3504.3," The novice, thank you."
3504.3,3508.3, They they can only suck up like metal and raw material.
3508.3,3512.3, And then like the other ones just don't suck up anything.
3512.3,3513.3, What do they do?
3513.3,3515.3, Do they do for energy?
3515.3,3522.3, It was the total annihilation method you just you build a building that just sits there and is in there and just generates a magic low.
3522.3,3524.3, It's not collecting for many things to make.
3524.3,3526.3," I think it's a nice point mode, you know."
3526.3,3529.3," Like I mean, as long as you have to have I mean, that's a huge thing."
3529.3,3537.3, You don't want the whole game to be decided strictly on the basis of whether or not you possess the best points right away.
3537.3,3545.3," But then right there that's making valuable and you create these areas where yeah, you can guarantee that people are going to want to fight there and then like what happens."
3545.3,3551.3," And you know, you have versions of it in warcraft and the company here is it will be you can start setting up minds and you know,"
3551.3,3556.3, camouflaging things in the area to set up ambushes and all sorts of fun stuff.
3556.3,3566.3," Well, I think that's always been one of the appeal of of relics series, both the company pharaohs games and the dawn of war games is that that that control point."
3566.3,3578.3," scheme of you know, your resources multiplying by how much of the map you control just quite obviously and naturally."
3578.3,3581.3, Encourages you to go out there and not turtle.
3581.3,3584.3," You know, that you can't win that way."
3584.3,3593.3, So whereas artisans in the past there's quite a few where you could really just while yourself in and just win by a treasure.
3593.3,3599.3," Yeah, you know, we still see people that are clearly used to that model."
3599.3,3606.3," Like Anthony and I just played a 2v2 and company heroes and the guys the opponents were like, why haven't we seen them anywhere?"
3606.3,3614.3," We're sitting there waiting at all the fuel and ammo points like, okay, any day now are they what are they doing or are they going to hit us with some lighting for you to tank."
3614.3,3622.3," We're still in our like light infantry phase or what and they never appeared so then we got all the way, you know, got full armies and go back to their base."
3622.3,3624.3, There's nothing but machine gun bunkers everywhere sure.
3624.3,3626.3," We're like, you got no ammo. You got no gas."
3626.3,3633.3," Can't do anything but make machine gun bunker. You can poor concrete, you know, we're just going to like drive right through them with heavy tanks and."
3633.3,3643.3," So yes, people are used to that much. Well, and old games encourage it. I mean like age vampires if you set the the wind conditions a certain way."
3643.3,3655.3," You know, you could win by creating a wonder and you you create a wonder by having this just obscene amount of resources and the wonder would be like whatever I don't remember now like a thanks or something."
3655.3,3659.3," And as soon as that thing was built, you make small wonder you win you win the whole game."
3659.3,3676.3," So in a multiplayer game, you know, there was one guy at computer gaming go back in the day when we all used to play our T.S. is at work and he was just a classic turtle or and we knew after a while, you know, because we would all fight amongst ourselves and he would just be sitting there in his corner of the map."
3676.3,3681.3," Building wall after wall after wall, making it completely impossible to get in there."
3681.3,3686.3," And then he would just be working on his wonder and at some point we don't have to go, oh fuck it over there."
3686.3,3697.3," Yeah, we got to start getting the story that we fought and I do miss it because it's strictly like side versus side and company heroes with the old warcraft two thing three might be the same way where it's like you can ally up with someone."
3697.3,3708.3," Oh, yeah, I mean, that was cool. Then you get all three ally up and then fight amongst yourselves afterwards. Right. Right. That's a whole element that I mean if we'd have to do that's another huge part of deathcon."
3708.3,3719.3," It's a version's game. Oh, yeah, the back for all between like, very long. The whole other element that's not right now. Yeah, right now you are my friend, but since we're done with that little agenda here."
3719.3,3721.3, That may have changed.
3721.3,3737.3," Yeah, the other I have for universal war. I actually had the most fun when I dropped the unit cap a bit because I think it allows for more kind of back and forth and less less people just hanging out waiting because you can you can reach the unit cap pretty quickly. And then you're just like, well,"
3737.3,3747.3," I can't mass more army anymore. So I might will use these guys to go do something. So, and then if you lower it lower it enough, you can actually like have some back and forth with the tactics like, okay, so this time they brought out these guys."
3747.3,3753.3, I have enough time now to build up a small army to kind of counter what I think he might do next.
3753.3,3760.3, This is a little more fun than the big like Max unit cap. Let's last on my whole army and run him on over.
3760.3,3765.3, Sorry. What we keep brushing when you brush your microphones on our clothes. It makes a big yes.
3765.3,3768.3, I've been hearing a lot of those in my ears.
3768.3,3772.3, I was just contribution to the RTS discussion.
3772.3,3775.3, What are the what are the big RTS coming up?
3775.3,3777.3, That's just start.
3777.3,3780.3," Well, yeah, that's the biggest one."
3780.3,3781.3, Don't know where to.
3781.3,3784.3," Don't know where to. Still unannounced, but we assume it's coming."
3784.3,3785.3, It's coming.
3785.3,3786.3, Right.
3786.3,3788.3, So another 40k expansion coming.
3788.3,3789.3, So storm.
3789.3,3791.3, Right. Sol storm is coming very soon.
3791.3,3795.3, We have a world shift to the recently announced.
3795.3,3799.3, We expect to see more of game more games along the lines of world shift.
3799.3,3805.3, And that's basically where you take an RTS and combine it with an MOMRPG conventions.
3805.3,3810.3," You have co-op RTS campaigning where you gather, you know, loot and items."
3810.3,3817.3, And then you can take those units and loot for your heroes and stuff and play them competitively and RTS with other players.
3817.3,3818.3, I do that.
3818.3,3819.3, I play that way a lot.
3819.3,3821.3," Like, that's a very valid way to play."
3821.3,3826.3," I think, because we in Keith will often team up on the same side and, you know, come stopping basically."
3826.3,3827.3, Yeah.
3827.3,3828.3, Yeah.
3828.3,3829.3, Yeah.
3829.3,3833.3, I think they all RTS is there's like no excuse for them not to have co-op campaigns.
3833.3,3835.3, That was a real bummer for me with.
3835.3,3839.3, I still haven't played co-op in here as campaigns through because I don't need co-op.
3839.3,3841.3, And then they announced that they're making it for the Chinese version.
3841.3,3843.3," Like, my, yeah."
3843.3,3844.3, Really?
3844.3,3845.3, Yeah.
3845.3,3846.3, I'm going to hear more.
3846.3,3848.3, I've been asking to try to get some details.
3848.3,3854.3," They're some, it sounds basically like the Asian version of Company Heroes is going to be along these lines too."
3854.3,3855.3, Combination of NMO and RTS.
3855.3,3856.3, Really?
3856.3,3857.3, Yeah.
3857.3,3858.3, Wow.
3858.3,3859.3, We're in.
3859.3,3860.3," Sounds great too, right?"
3860.3,3861.3, Yeah.
3861.3,3862.3, Like maybe they'll just release it free content over here.
3862.3,3864.3, I don't know who knows.
3864.3,3870.3," The other game, another game I picked up played a big, big brain academy, we degree."
3870.3,3871.3, Really?
3871.3,3872.3, I recommend it to all of you guys.
3872.3,3875.3, I'll have W's and for when you have family and friends over and stuff.
3875.3,3876.3, Yep.
3876.3,3877.3, What kind of stuff?
3877.3,3878.3," It's a, it's a great game form."
3878.3,3880.3," I mean, like what do you do?"
3880.3,3887.3, A lot of sort of visual and spatial intelligence tests.
3887.3,3891.3," But what, what would happen is like, safe, if all four of us were playing, we each have our column."
3891.3,3894.3, And they're going to be a battery of 16 tests.
3894.3,3896.3, Are you choose 20 or 10?
3896.3,3897.3, However many.
3897.3,3898.3, And we're trying to race through them.
3898.3,3900.3, Be the first to complete them all.
3900.3,3903.3," So if you fail one, you just do it again, some other iteration."
3903.3,3905.3, And some of them are pretty pretty damn tricky.
3905.3,3906.3, And they're actually very good.
3906.3,3910.3," They're like, if the kind of things that would perfectly belong in an IQ test."
3910.3,3914.3," Not might be to show if you have like a 3D model of, um,"
3914.3,3916.3, and you should see it from the top down.
3916.3,3919.3, Say they're like little toy cars going around this board.
3919.3,3922.3, And they're slight differences to their shape or something.
3922.3,3925.3, And then you have a view of it of a camera view.
3925.3,3927.3, And then you have to choose what that camera view is.
3927.3,3929.3, Where's the camera situated that's letting you see what's going on?
3929.3,3931.3, That's letting you see what you're seeing in there.
3931.3,3934.3," But of course, they pick something that's going to be very confusing."
3934.3,3936.3, This is all at the all look almost exactly the same.
3936.3,3937.3, And there's only.
3937.3,3939.3, And there would be upside down or something.
3939.3,3941.3," And they're basically causing you to, I mean,"
3941.3,3944.3, engaging your ability to take in immediately graphs.
3944.3,3948.3, What's happening there and rotate it in your mind and do all these different things with it.
3948.3,3949.3, That could be one.
3949.3,3951.3, Another would be.
3951.3,3952.3," Um,"
3952.3,3955.3, To deal for a bunch of balloons on screen.
3955.3,3958.3," And there's numbers, negative numbers, positive numbers."
3958.3,3961.3," It's the most pop them in order from lowest to highest, but then that sounds"
3961.3,3962.3, very basic.
3962.3,3967.3," But what they'll do is, maybe like a two will be an enormous balloon."
3967.3,3968.3, And a 48 will be a tiny balloon.
3968.3,3969.3, And yeah.
3969.3,3970.3, And it's causing it.
3970.3,3972.3, It's it's playing against two different tendencies.
3972.3,3973.3, And right.
3973.3,3977.3, And that's just associate the larger size with an increase in quantity.
3977.3,3981.3, So you're trying to differentiate those two things.
3981.3,3983.3, And they sound boring individually.
3983.3,3984.3, But when you do them.
3984.3,3986.3, It's actually more fun.
3986.3,3987.3, I also got Ravenrabbit's two.
3987.3,3991.1400000000003," two and that's another kind of game where four people play and you just do these quick, you know,"
3991.1400000000003,3996.26, mini game type things and I have it a lot more fun with we to agree then and I thought it would be the
3996.26,4002.9," other way around. But I mean, I was in the brain age for a while. Yeah, I was too. I mean,"
4002.9,4006.82, even the town had even more limited than that because we were like only like how many games
4006.82,4010.9," five or so, but it was like, you know, they're far the word they're far more games than this. The word"
4010.98,4017.06," read is blue and you're, yeah, who brains like, but after a while, even those you quickly train yourself"
4017.06,4022.42, to like not pay attention to what they're trying to trick you with. Right. So it's got a lot more
4022.42,4027.54," games like that. There's some other, there's other multiplayer modes. There might be like a board and you"
4027.54,4032.34, take turns picking the difference sorts of seeing who can go the longest and then you'll get
4032.34,4037.62," out, you'll collect points for your turn. So like they'll throw like as many iterations of the increasing"
4037.7,4042.42," difficulty of a puzzle that you as possible and say you accomplish eight of them before you fail,"
4042.42,4046.5, then you'll get eight points for your turn and then you'll tell you at the points at the end.
4047.2999999999997,4050.5," Okay, you might have to trust because I got a like Sean when you're talking about club and we're all"
4050.5,4055.7," like, yeah, you know, but this isn't well, especially at you Jeff, if you took it home and played with"
4055.7,4061.7," your daughter, yeah, no, it's fun. We got Mario Party for that reason, like to play that kind of game with"
4061.7,4065.8599999999997, like four people around. That's not a good game though. It's not good because they got the board
4065.86,4072.98, aspect of it is just a huge part of it and six toe so long is a dumb and then it's like 15 seconds
4072.98,4076.9, of the cool fun stuff and then you're back to like two minutes of just like waiting for people to
4076.9,4081.3," roll dice and that's always been the problem. If they took away all that bullshit and they just said,"
4081.3,4084.6600000000003, here's the many games we're just going to throw them at you like warriorware and you guys all do
4084.6600000000003,4089.1400000000003," these. Yeah, those are pretty fun and that's what like raving rabbits is. Yeah, so you should get that instead."
4089.1400000000003,4091.54," It's like mine, I wouldn't even mind a board game if it wasn't so"
4092.5,4097.62, it wasn't didn't dominate so much. It takes way too long to watch the animations and to watch the
4097.62,4101.86," die roll and the characters go around the board and then at the end, only for them to undo the entire"
4101.86,4106.34," thing by throwing you, oh well, here's like five other random things. So even though you were"
4106.34,4115.7," ahead, we just like pick fucking straws from the beginning and play some games and let us say at the end."
4116.179999999999,4121.86," The journey, not the destination exactly. No, it's the destination. No. I can't put it to the journey."
4123.38,4128.5," No, I have that that is a huge problem with game. There's another there's a card game we had bought"
4128.5,4132.98, that had the same exact function. It was called killer bunnies and we were that was like
4132.98,4138.0199999999995, kind of fun and then literally at the last turn you all just roll a die to see who wins.
4138.82,4142.5," It was like, wait, why did we play all of this and it's like that can ruin a whole game design."
4142.5,4147.06," Even if the whole team problem with that series for yeah, can ever. One day one. It's stupid."
4147.06,4151.14," Yeah, there was a little bit of that in that game. Shit, what was that game buzz buzz."
4151.14,4156.5, The mega quiz. The thing that I played with with shit buzz the mega quiz. That's it buzz the mega
4156.5,4163.7, quiz. Same chain and Mike Thanaho and Kathleen back for that one up promo that went
4163.7,4168.1," it got to the end that was something like ridiculous round where, you know, after all this in"
4168.1,4175.38," which Shane had fairly legitimately gotten a lot more points than everybody else. Of course,"
4175.38,4180.900000000001," he was kind of a weasel about it, but he did he did legitimately get those points."
4182.5,4186.660000000001," At the very end though, there were a couple rounds where it practically negated everything that"
4186.660000000001,4191.14," that happened until then. Isn't it going crazy? Oh yeah, it was awesome. Yeah. Yeah."
4192.5,4194.34," Oh, yeah. No little thing that."
4195.3,4196.34, Yeah.
4196.34,4201.34, It is a design do's and this. That's before we go on to other now playing. It's okay. I got some
4201.34,4204.34, time and we'll savage too. And.
4206.34,4211.46," Sorry, I just I was Sean, you were throwing me the look of like, do we need a break? We do need a"
4211.46,4216.66," break. Can you say savage to you for a post break there? Mr. Elliott. Hi, can you? Excellent."
4216.66,4219.78," When we come back, Sean Elliott on savage too."
4220.179999999999,4225.7, You were a member of a secondary 15 that is brought in to find more information regarding the
4225.7,4231.38, secret projected armacham. Expect the intensity of battle to continue in the second expansion
4231.38,4234.58," packed to the critically acclaimed first person shooter, fear."
4236.179999999999,4242.0199999999995," Uh, we're back. Uh, took a little food break there and and Sean Elliott. So,"
4242.0199999999995,4246.179999999999," tonight's guy he was going to buy Ryan some gummy bears during the break, but there is a"
4246.18,4251.22, fucking price of gummy bears beat them bullshit. You had another reason to hate our snack machine.
4251.9400000000005,4255.54, There's a lot of reasons to hate our snack machine. They really are. Do you just
4255.54,4260.58, snack machine's better than our soda machine? Do a whole podcast about our soda machine that
4260.58,4265.62, doesn't lay. Yeah. And it keeps getting longer every day by like five seconds. You were timing
4265.62,4271.54," at that one day. You fucked in a me timing it. You were a little second to yeah, you put your money in."
4271.62,4277.06, You hear the the can drop and but then it doesn't come out of the machine. So you don't know
4277.06,4281.38," if you're about to go long time. Yeah. Yeah. Do it all the way. It always comes out, though,"
4281.38,4285.78, eventually. Yeah. It's really bizarre. I don't know what it's going. Because I've like shoved my hand up
4285.78,4296.74, there and like. Listener should know that that Ryan Scott is the king of of Agro on the
4296.74,4300.34, candy machine. I would just about to say like you stick your hand and just beat the hell out of the
4300.34,4304.66, thing. Yeah. When Ryan doesn't get his candy the entire eighth floor in this building
4304.66,4310.0199999999995," that San Francisco knows it. Hey, I'm not the only one. There are people who there are other people"
4310.0199999999995,4314.82, who flip out pretty bad. I don't know if there's anybody who makes a whole fucking floor shake like you do.
4314.82,4320.099999999999, I haven't done it in a while. It's impressive. I kind of realized I was taking it a little too far.
4320.099999999999,4325.54," Yeah. Didn't didn't our boss, the esteemed Mr. Simon Cox come to the house office at one point."
4325.54,4329.54," What the hell's going on here? Yeah. Because he walked by, he walked by my office and knew it's like"
4329.54,4335.06," what the hell's going on in that? Like a, Ryan's getting incredible. I think that's the point where I realize"
4335.06,4340.34," like maybe I shouldn't do this anymore. Sometimes you gotta give it up. Leave in the shit. No, yeah,"
4340.34,4344.82," poor guy. Yeah. Ryan always tries these angry notes and tape some to them. No, you know what? No,"
4344.82,4350.18," I don't. I write creative notes. I meant to be taken humorously with like diagrams. Yeah, you know,"
4350.18,4354.58, if that's your job and some guys written some like fucking smart ass and.
4355.54,4359.14, I don't know if he's going to be taken it. You would take it humorously. That's bad. That's as
4359.14,4365.14, Dick is when like in the dorms that the the janitors put up the sign around the showers telling
4365.14,4370.82," people to stop like you're nating in the showers. But no, this is worse. That's not the funny part."
4370.82,4376.74," Well, that's funny. We took in like we went and like copy corrected it and marked it up with"
4376.74,4381.54," the red pen and gave it a great on the top and then at the bottom wrote, please see me after."
4381.86,4387.7, That's real nice. Yeah. Okay. That was fucked up. You're mean. Yeah.
4389.3,4396.82, Okay. So we're back and Sean was going to tell us about the seven to two. Ryan's supposed to
4396.82,4401.62," be joining Ryan's discussion, but you didn't do any to tell people what savage one was. Do we need a"
4401.62,4407.14, history lesson? I think a little history explaining to will explain one. That's true. If you take
4407.22,4413.780000000001," the idea of an RTS with its structure, the way that you basically collect resources and you have"
4413.780000000001,4420.9800000000005, buildings and you buff units and some units are more powerful than others. Instead of putting
4420.9800000000005,4426.58," one person in charge of each army, you make every player in the game one of those units or whatever"
4426.58,4433.3, and you each and you divide the responsibilities among amongst them. And then you have somebody
4433.3,4438.34, overseeing it on the RTS level. A commander on each level. But then if you imagine
4439.62,4444.66," in an RTS game, you're commanding the different units like the Grants or whatever. But they could"
4444.66,4448.74, say fuck you mean instead of socks off. Right. That could be like either big when you're like
4450.1,4455.7, when you tell them that they need to go go in like 2040 more or. All right. Imagine if like you're
4455.7,4461.7," directing your or arc soldier to go over there and he's like, yeah, you got another agenda. This is"
4461.78,4466.179999999999, actually yeah. This is a huge part of I mean when you when we outline it this way and you're thinking
4466.179999999999,4471.86," yourself how much can go wrong. Sounds like a wow battle. Well, it does go wrong. I think it's a cool"
4471.86,4476.26," game. First of all, the game is only available. It's not available in stores. Go to their site."
4476.26,4480.74," I'm not sure if it's on Steam now, but if you just put Savage to that, you know, into your browser,"
4480.74,4487.3, it'll take you to their website. You buy to game there. It's cheap and it's very much like it
4487.38,4494.58, epitomizes. I don't know the the PC game for me right now just because it's you know self self
4494.58,4501.06, published and it's super complicated. And there's just like no apologies for anyone. It's like you're
4501.06,4504.58, going to figure this out. You're going to figure it out. I mean there's you know there's some
4504.58,4511.9400000000005, help tutorial and stuff when you get the game if you want. But it's not like a self explanatory
4511.9400000000005,4516.1," stuff, you know when you go in there like in like okay you shoot someone and you kill them and that's"
4516.18,4520.26, it. I mean there's a lot going on and people are doing stuff. You're like how they're summoning
4520.26,4524.820000000001, creatures and they're buffing each other and how are you doing that? Why do I just have this stupid
4524.820000000001,4529.9400000000005, like hammer that just keeps me in? I really love Savage one. I thought it was really ahead of
4529.9400000000005,4535.620000000001, its time at the time. And I didn't even mind being a grunt. Sometimes I actually kind of got into it.
4535.620000000001,4540.660000000001, I don't know. You're not always a grunt either. I play well. You end up becoming the
4540.74,4545.22, equivalent of like hero units because you sort of level up right? And with the combination of
4545.22,4551.0599999999995," you leveling up in your your commander buffing you, you can become like just a giant ogre or something."
4551.0599999999995,4556.5, And you come like stomping down the trail and you know in the ogres case wielding like a tree
4556.5,4565.7," is a club, the clutch of the ogre and being people with that. You know big heavy magic casters and"
4565.78,4572.66, all these other things. It's the game's hash to bring back an old word. Heshes comes from
4572.66,4577.22, a Hessian but I don't know. And there when I was in high school it just was for any like kind of
4577.22,4582.0199999999995," like a long hair, rag a muffin, you know like a kind of like a rocker too. We know like a rip"
4582.0199999999995,4587.54, denim vest and they games just hash. I don't know. Like just got metal plane and it's all
4587.54,4594.179999999999, you know demons and stuff. It's just a Hessian game. Just not saying it's good or bad thing. It's just a
4594.26,4599.62, hashting. Something odd right now. I don't have the full version. It was playing the demo.
4599.62,4604.66," The great idea is that you go to the site, you get five hours access to the game. You're like"
4604.66,4611.700000000001," hey, what a great way to demo the game. It's set. You get this nerf-dass annoying version where"
4611.700000000001,4618.5," when you die it's like a 25 second time or 22nd timer starts and then the screen pops up and says,"
4618.5,4622.66," hey, guess what? The other people that bought this game don't have to wait 20 seconds. Oh boy."
4622.74,4628.099999999999," Yeah. They're here to buy now and then you're picking your characters and it's like, do you want to be like"
4628.099999999999,4633.0599999999995," weak or weaker? And then you're just like all these all these like other options on the right, you know?"
4633.0599999999995,4638.34," Uh-huh. Oh, awesome. Super awesome. That's a sale of the ship is what that is. Yeah. Maybe you should"
4638.34,4643.22," about the damn gate. Right. If you want to be a commander, oh, too bad. Yeah. You got to pay for the"
4643.22,4648.34," game. You get a pink pixie though. Yeah. There you go. That kind of stuff is weird. It's I mean,"
4648.900000000001,4652.58," let people play the game for five hours and if it's great, then they want to come back."
4652.58,4656.66," Yeah. Yeah. Tell them how much greater it's going to be if you paid for it, you know,"
4657.38,4663.06, seems kind of odd. That might actually turn people off. It could. Yeah. I hope it doesn't. But I
4663.06,4666.9800000000005, think you're trying to get that stuff. Yeah. The game itself isn't very expensive though. And
4666.9800000000005,4676.66," what is it like, 1999 rain? 30, 1999. Yeah. I haven't played it enough to thoroughly understand it"
4676.74,4680.34," to the point where, you know, I'm going around and maybe I'll build like a little armory so"
4680.34,4685.78, that my allies can can stock up. It's got a back and forth. You play it in first person or third person.
4686.98,4691.0599999999995," Well, it's like the shooting, because some characters will have, you know, like, steam punk weapons"
4691.0599999999995,4694.9," and stuff. And that'll be in first person in all the mailings and third. It's kind of like,"
4694.9,4699.22," you know, killed or is there something you have your power items listed on the bottom. You might"
4699.22,4704.66, do some big spinning attack or like a stealth stab or like you can summon creatures if you're
4704.74,4708.98," changing things. It's kind of like a spy, right? You can disguise as one of your enemies or become"
4708.98,4715.7," like a leopard or something like that. Eventually, your team is fielding battering rams and"
4715.7,4720.34, tributeshays and all sorts of things. Seems pretty promising. I'm definitely going to go back in
4720.34,4724.5, and defeat the input I'm hearing from other people when I sort of my gaming site where they've
4724.5,4728.099999999999, been playing it is good and they like it and they want to play more. I'm going to check it out.
4728.099999999999,4734.26," I was like, I really like the first game. Sadly, underrecognized at the time. The problem that I see"
4734.66,4738.0199999999995, I'm not sure that they're going to overcome is the whole deal with the commander and again.
4739.62,4744.82," When you make these kind of games, you're always assuming like you're designing for some sort of like"
4745.22,4751.139999999999, creature disposed to live in a utopia and work together. It's another reality of the fact that
4751.139999999999,4755.94," everyone, you can only, you know, like the opposite would be like valves approach with team"
4755.94,4760.58, fortresses that you can only assume people are going to behave with selfish motivations. So you have to
4761.54,4765.78," and quick words is the same way. You know, you have to find some way to reward people individually"
4765.78,4771.62," for everything they do. Instead, what you get is like maybe the commander he needs some more"
4771.62,4777.22," like points before he can do something for your team and he'll be like, dude, get me, get me your"
4777.22,4781.0599999999995, points because you can click a button to give the points over to your commander. Right. So he
4781.0599999999995,4785.14, becomes like a preacher in the church asking for a tie. Then he's telling you like how it's going to
4785.14,4791.46, come back to you sevenfold. But he's up there doing his like good things will come from above and
4791.46,4796.660000000001," like he right from heaven. He can give you some extra powers, you know. But otherwise people are like"
4797.22,4802.1, they give you my points. Right. And it sounds like something that give you my heart. It's like over time
4802.1,4806.1, the more you play at the more you might realize that these are valuable things to give you. Yeah. Or
4806.1,4810.58," I mean obviously he seems really suited to like clan play and stuff like that. Yeah, I mean my experience"
4810.66,4815.54, in Savage one was especially in just you know the pickup games that I was always playing was
4815.54,4821.14, it like every other game like this or I suppose like actual war itself you know like you would
4821.14,4826.34, only be as good as your commander right. I mean if your commander was a bonehead your team just could
4826.34,4831.14, not do anything. Yeah. And it was just constantly a matter of a lot of the games I played where it was
4831.14,4836.82, just one commander after another getting voted off you know. And that happens even in battlefield.
4837.299999999999,4842.099999999999, Yeah. And the evolution of this notion of a commander role it's going to be interesting to see if it
4842.099999999999,4847.54, just sort of dies off and people give up on it like Valve did. I keep referencing them because team
4847.54,4852.9, Fortress 2 was a supposed to have a commander mode before you know battlefield 2 introduced one in
4852.9,4858.099999999999, that game and they just decided against it. And the problems are that you know again your commander
4858.099999999999,4865.46, is either so powerful that your team wins or loses on the strength of his or her play or is so
4865.46,4870.1, weak that it's like why do you want to be a commander in the first place. Yeah. And that's basically
4870.1,4874.5, what happens in battlefield. The commander is pretty weak and they found a decent middle ground.
4874.5,4880.34, The artillery is is a huge bonus right. But it can't cost you the game. If you have a team full
4880.34,4884.58, of great players and you have an idiotic commander the supply drops and stuff they help but they're
4884.58,4890.66, not going to decide the game. Sounds like the commander is really important and in Savage 2 though.
4890.66,4895.14, I haven't played that role yet because I didn't want it was you know it was easily half the game.
4895.54,4901.38, You know if not more you know because he was directing all the players. The whole strategy was
4901.38,4909.14, basically coming from this one dude. Speaking of battlefield we should probably segue to
4909.7,4914.82, we're going to talk about our cover story. Okay. The new issue. The cab ride that we took to the
4914.82,4918.5, right. I want to do that too but I feel like it's we're running out of time. We want to do the
4918.5,4922.02, cab ride first. We could do that first. We'll do that first. We're doing overtime right.
4922.9800000000005,4927.700000000001, Someone could be knocking at her door and okay nine minutes. Let's do battlefield and then we're
4927.700000000001,4931.780000000001, here. We're on a nine minute countdown until some other bastards or want to surround but we'll try
4931.780000000001,4936.9800000000005, to squeeze it as much as we can. She shouldn't say the battlefield part that everyone wants to hear about.
4938.26,4942.900000000001, If it's important I'm out there I'm telling you we're not stopping. They can fuck off. We're going
4942.900000000001,4949.14, to keep going. Okay. So we might be the retranauts. Oh really maybe. Wait do we like them again or
4949.14,4953.780000000001, do we like them? We like them. Oh yeah right. We made them in with them. Okay. Now we're having these
4953.780000000001,4960.1, spots. No I am in a very threat. Actually I admit it that I like to force a nomina. So eight minutes to
4960.1,4967.3, talk about. Okay. All right. Sorry. You put me on the spot. Sorry. So what about battlefield? We know
4967.3,4972.34, what's free. Right. When I was talking about well actually I'm not going to read the system specs
4972.34,4978.740000000001, but it's going to run on a wide range of computers. It's built for like if you just get a laptop
4978.82,4982.82, if you got a laptop in the past few years or something it's going to run on that. You didn't have
4982.82,4988.5," to go and look and read the ultimate gaming guide and find a $5,000 computer it's there for you."
4990.66,4995.0599999999995, First things first about the advertisements. Here's how it works. The advertising in the game is cool
4995.0599999999995,5000.26, for me because it's not just like pictures on the wall but it's interactive. You know like some
5000.26,5004.58, of the examples they gave us for this cover story is like when you're playing there might be like
5004.58,5008.5, Arnold Schwarzenegger pitcher and then like a George Bush pitcher and they're both like pumping
5008.5,5013.54, iron. You have to see like you have to guess like which one is going to like do more reps in the
5013.54,5024.02, shorter amount of time. The fucking you talking. Or like no that sounds cool. I think one you ready.
5027.06,5031.46, Another example they're kind of dumb but like on the back of a tank right they have like the
5031.46,5036.74, quote number of a bumper a mean of a license plate but it's a big rectangular frame and in there
5036.74,5042.26, they'll have three sets of eyebrows and it might be like free to call low and I don't know if you
5042.26,5046.34, like like George Jack Nicholson or something then you have to guess whose eyebrows they are. So it's
5046.34,5052.42, as it was like but it's fun. What the fucking talking about. Okay so being griefed I'm being
5052.42,5057.219999999999, telling. I'm being racist. I'm being facetious. There are no advertisements in the game when you're
5057.219999999999,5062.42, playing the game. Those are all versions of you know shitty pop ups and stuff you're on a website and
5062.5,5066.42, there's all the stuff. Yeah hyperactive stuff going on in the side. So there's none of that. There's
5066.42,5071.38, none of that. The way that they're getting their money is by you playing the game you're going
5071.38,5075.38, to go to the game's website and when you first go there if there will be advertisements on that.
5077.54,5084.26, In addition to that there's going to be an extensive social network and modeled on you know a
5084.26,5089.3, Facebook or a Myspace or something and through each you know you're going to have your own page
5089.38,5096.5, and through this page you'll be able to look at your score your stats your items. Your team which
5096.5,5100.58, I have to talk about because there's a meta game your team stats or movies you take. The game is
5100.58,5106.34, got a battle quarter once again you can host those and share those from your site. So there's a
5106.34,5110.820000000001, lot more there you know we talk about what all is on that page in the cover story but basically
5112.34,5117.06, to get this game interesting enough so that you're you want to do stuff outside of it and you're on
5117.14,5122.02, this page you know communicating with other people and doing various things and there might be
5122.02,5127.9400000000005, advertisements on that page too. So that it in a nutshell is what's going to pay for it. They expect
5127.9400000000005,5133.860000000001, that to be the main source of income to the point that they think that like 99 or 95 or whatever
5133.860000000001,5138.42, presented people that play the game will never buy in game items. There will be some items to purchase
5138.42,5144.5, in the game but all the speculation of I'm just going to be able to buy it myself like say a
5144.5,5150.66, King Tiger tank where my team mate just gets a Sherman or something. That's another guarantee
5150.66,5154.26, that they have. You're not going to be able to buy yourself by your way to victory.
5154.82,5160.5, This is a few buy weapons at all. Right now here's the other thing about this game it's going to
5160.5,5168.02, be changing and developing radically every month if things go according to plan. So because of that
5169.06,5173.22, a lot of its provisional and it's like I don't pretend to know what they're playing two years from now
5173.780000000001,5177.22, but from rollout and in this year they're not going to be charging you for items.
5177.780000000001,5184.58, Instead they have in mind or this notion of a convenience of a convenience item or a convenience
5184.58,5191.62, perk modeled on things that are available on Korean MMOs and such. An example might be that say we're
5191.62,5197.06, both playing and you know I'm playing it every night after work and you're only playing it
5197.780000000001,5203.620000000001, in between episodes of Gilmour Girls or so you only get half the time to play it. That shows over
5203.620000000001,5211.14, duh hi. Welcome to last year. So what you might be able to do is you could buy an XP
5211.14,5216.580000000001, enhancer so that when you play you're going to get like maybe a third or half more XP.
5216.580000000001,5222.02, I'm doing the things I've pressed down a storm. Okay. And that way you can catch up to the
5222.02,5226.580000000001, poop sockers and some capacity if you want to pay that extra you know of course you don't have
5226.580000000001,5231.860000000001, to or you could just play it's great and you get the XP and then the XP of course will allow you to unlock things.
5234.580000000001,5241.860000000001, The game is it's you've seen the look it looks like Team Portures 2. The thinking there
5243.3,5246.42, first thing I'm kind of like pausing is the thing about how to approach this. The first thing
5246.42,5251.38, I thought you asked him right Team Portures 2 was a phenomenal success when did you just begin
5251.46,5257.06, working on this project and the visual appearance of this game gel. They insisted it had been
5257.86,5262.42, on the design dock stage well before the development public with Team Portures 2. You know
5262.42,5268.66," take it really but that's what they say. In their favor, Lars Gustafson of DICE has always been"
5268.66,5273.06, interested in the cartoon battlefield even from the early days of like codename eagle and the
5273.06,5279.7, way that battlefield 1942 played. Just like Team Portures 2 I mean Team Portures series where there's
5279.86,5284.82, fundamental absurdity to red team and blue team fighting in bases built 10 feet across from one
5284.82,5290.42, and other and all the various and same things they do. Being ported in some realistic and life-like
5290.42,5294.98, environment they said while those are world war 2 setting or contemporary war setting people
5294.98,5299.3, were walking on wings. Those are very fun and aspect about field 42 you know you need to
5300.5,5304.42, ferry a team made across a map just have them laid out on the wing and you fly really carefully and you
5304.5,5312.18, drop them off putting C T and T charges even before C and T put it even before T and T charges before C4
5312.82,5316.74, in battle fields. You're putting those in your Jeep and using that to blow up jump out of it and
5316.74,5320.9800000000005, blow something up or putting them on on a berm driving over it and detonating it so they launch
5320.9800000000005,5325.7, as you off a berm over the ocean and onto an aircraft carrier deck. So they're saying let's take all
5325.7,5332.58, these things and like make a game that basically celebrates that sort of insanity you know getting hit
5332.66,5337.3, by a tank shell having the tank shell not immediately kill you but throwing you 40 feet into the air
5337.3,5342.66, and then giving you a chance to hit your parachute to sort of float safely down after that.
5344.1,5349.46, To that effect they want to make things like they want to simplify things and so
5350.74,5355.22, crouching it's not this old system of you know your accuracy is improving when you're crouching
5355.22,5359.94, it's improving further when you're in a prone position. The downside of that to all the battlefield
5360.0199999999995,5365.0599999999995, games is that they became dolphin diving games or prone spamming games as they were called.
5365.0599999999995,5370.179999999999, You basically you make visual contact with another guy on foot you immediately hit your prone key
5370.179999999999,5374.5, which I would hate you know smart players would decide something like really accessible and then you
5374.5,5380.0199999999995, shoot first. And that became kind of dumb so you know there's no prone at all this time crouching
5380.0199999999995,5383.62, is there but it's not going to make you it's not going to improve your accuracy it's just there
5383.62,5388.58, for when you want to take cover or something and instead what it means is that your firefighter
5388.66,5393.7, is going to be a little longer you know you have time to run around chase people around corners
5393.7,5399.0599999999995, and into buildings and stuff um everyone has the ability to heal themselves and some capacity
5399.62,5406.26, not non stop but you know it's one of your one of your abilities and like wise you know it's
5406.26,5410.0199999999995, like planes are going to be able to just rip them up bombs on them they're not going to you're
5410.0199999999995,5414.5, not going to be able to just kill people over and over again with impunity any you know if someone
5414.58,5418.66, has a Thompson submachine gun they can shoot at your plane and do damage to it right it's not
5418.66,5422.5, going to blow your plane up on this shot but and what's the what's the reasoning behind that?
5423.38,5428.18, Once again is to well it's pretty well known in fact at least in Battlefield 42 in
5428.18,5434.34, Battlefield 2 aircraft were they were like god weapons yeah they're called they were they gave you
5434.34,5440.18, a huge advantage when they tried to deal with that in Battlefield 21 42 they kind of went too far
5440.26,5445.62, on that they nerfed it a little too much and made it so that they're not as effective so they still
5445.62,5449.700000000001, wanted to be good you know you do a good strafing run on someone it's like you're you're going to get
5449.700000000001,5456.1, them but but people have the ability to take you down the spawning system is going to be simplified
5456.740000000001,5462.1, instead of um picking where you're going to go the game is going to just decide where to put you this
5462.1,5465.9400000000005, is a good and a bad thing for if you're a new player it doesn't mean sitting there staring at this
5466.0199999999995,5472.9, map and trying to figure out what's going on recurring players though I do imagine that this is going
5472.9,5478.419999999999, to be like I don't know I think they're going to be upset a little bit because part of the great the
5478.419999999999,5482.419999999999, the great aspect of the Battlefield games is when they introduce the squad system and that you
5482.419999999999,5486.419999999999, could spawn on the squad leader and that means if you're like invent once the group of people you can
5486.419999999999,5492.0199999999995, always stay together um the inability to do that was actually a trouble for us in quick
5492.02,5495.620000000001, wars and it might be one of the reasons why we ended up not playing at long term you know month after
5495.620000000001,5499.22, month after month after month it's like let's meet up somewhere but only as someone's always going to
5499.22,5503.780000000001, die on the way or something and it just falls apart and you just find some specific role and do it
5503.780000000001,5508.820000000001, but not never in this like really well coordinated group capacity so without that that could be an issue
5510.42,5515.700000000001, also games yeah sorry the idea of not letting players pick wasn't that also to keep it
5516.34,5521.46, the action moving it is so the players won't spawn back at the original base that's another
5521.54,5527.86, that's another good thing and or even just in an idiotic spot you know like back in the base
5527.86,5532.82, is one too so everyone's spawning at the home base and waiting for the helicopter because it's so good
5535.06,5538.74, or going to the other side of the map where no one's going to be and everyone knows or there's
5538.74,5542.5, this everyone that knows anything knows that you want to go over here and that this is a more valuable
5542.5,5548.1, territory it's going to just put you there the downside is sort of visible in games like call
5548.18,5552.660000000001, duty it's not a downside as much as a trade-off there's pros and cons to whatever you do in a
5552.660000000001,5558.820000000001, spawning system and COD is one word automatically spawns you toward the action but it then becomes
5559.620000000001,5563.860000000001, fairly easy to exploit that where you get a sense of where people are going to appear in and you
5563.860000000001,5569.9400000000005, consider all your courses and stuff vehicle problem with waiting for vehicles they want to make
5569.9400000000005,5574.820000000001, it so that if you go to the vehicle spawn one will appear for you you don't have to just and that's
5574.9,5578.82, another reason why they want to make it so that the vehicles are not godly it's because if you ever
5578.82,5584.98, get a circumstance where so many people have them right we should say too just just to say it
5584.98,5590.98, if it's not obvious because I've seen this in a few message board forums this is not battlefield
5590.98,5597.38, three right so you know there is also a battlefield three in development these are totally separate
5597.38,5602.0199999999995, games yes so if you're resenting if you're listening and resenting anything you're hearing about
5602.5,5608.34, battlefield the series being like dumb-down or change fundamentally this is actually essentially a side
5608.34,5613.22, project it is and it and it who knows though it could become I mean if it's so you know
5613.22,5617.9400000000005, phenomenal like successful it could become the main one we don't know very experimental all right
5619.14,5622.1, some other interesting things about is of course your character you're going to be getting all these
5622.1,5628.740000000001, points as you play and you get these abilities not unlike perks in in COD4 and I'm not going to
5628.74,5633.3, list them all again there's there's a bunch of discussion of that in in the book but um might be an
5633.3,5637.94, incendiary round so you you hit someone with your bullets and the sets of them on fire and the way
5637.94,5643.62, this works is again kind of like one of the ability buttons that you see either in an RTS or an MMO
5643.62,5648.74, down in the bottom of the screen and it's got a timer on it so maybe you use it once and you can't
5648.74,5652.9, just like abuse it by doing it nonstop then you've got to wait another 30 seconds before you're
5652.9,5657.0599999999995, able to do it again and you want to make sure that you use it at a good time sometimes it's
5657.14,5663.620000000001, going to make sense another ability might be to say pick up a grenade throw it back at someone
5663.620000000001,5670.5, when they've thrown a grenade at you like heightened awareness where you can sort of see someone through
5670.5,5674.9800000000005, walls for a short amount of time this supposed to be influenced by the kind of battle sense you see
5674.9800000000005,5679.9400000000005, in in hollywood versions of war where someone goes into a building they just know that people are in
5679.9400000000005,5685.54, there so those sorts of things will be fun to unlock and it'll be interesting to those sort of
5685.54,5690.1, of manage how they unlockable right not those are game purchasable no you can't purchase these
5690.1,5695.3, but you you unlock them game it'll be interesting to see how they balance that of course you're
5695.3,5699.22, better right if you if you have the ability to see through walls now and then and you can shoot
5699.22,5704.0199999999995, and send your bullets you have a huge advantage over so no but they do have the full
5705.78,5710.82, you know ranking system and player matching the online stuff is really modeled on on Halo
5710.82,5714.0199999999995, the way that they work there so people are in the same category they're going to put you
5714.02,5718.18, together with people like that if you have a plan and you want to play just with friends that will
5718.18,5722.820000000001, work too you still have options to do that where you can either form a party again like in Halo
5722.820000000001,5726.9800000000005, when your whole party goes or you just look online and join someone's game that's on your friends
5726.9800000000005,5730.9800000000005, list but for the most part it's going to do everything and it's power to sort it so it's not like
5730.9800000000005,5738.18, you're playing against level 300 people and you got level 5 um vehicle right now the another
5738.26,5745.22," or something that that right now um they're there planes, jeeps and tanks in the game some"
5745.22,5749.780000000001, interesting stuff about the tanks and really to talk about the in the cover story they talk about
5749.780000000001,5754.820000000001, here is that again they don't want it so that you you shoot a tank shell somewhere and it does
5754.820000000001,5758.900000000001, huge splash damage so you can kind of just fish for kills by shooting down alley stuff where
5758.900000000001,5763.780000000001, you know our spawns are but they they are pretty destructive when you hit someone but you
5763.86,5768.259999999999, don't have that ability nor can you use the machine gun at the same time so it's like in between
5768.259999999999,5772.179999999999, reloads on the on the main turret you can't just blast everywhere with that you have to switch
5772.179999999999,5776.42, seats or you can have someone in the seat with you up and up in the turret and then that's kind
5776.42,5780.66, of fun because they might be spinning around trying to keep people from you know sticking sticky
5780.66,5785.7, chip bombs on your tank and stuff like that and then the further bounce that like a sticky bomb would
5785.7,5792.5, now have like a delay on it it would have a timer so that if you're in the tank you have the
5792.5,5797.38, opportunity to get out of the tank and bail on it well you get some sort of notice that there's
5797.38,5802.58, a bomb on your tank that's the thing you'll see that there's a bomb on there okay um and the tanks
5802.58,5807.46, are all compressed and stubby they're very you know a metal slug it's like super deformed things so
5807.46,5812.02, you can actually use them like use cover with them in the way that you would use cover on
5812.02,5817.54, foot almost or if there's like a rock or a tree like zip back around behind there and they they
5817.54,5823.86, kind of want to keep you basically in tank fights fighting at long range in approaching congested
5823.86,5827.3, areas and then when you're in the congest area then it's like basically infantry is going to
5827.3,5830.34, own you because they can come out from anywhere and drop bombs all over you and stuff
5833.38,5837.22, some other cool things about the game is that okay so you have that that's the vehicle set right
5837.22,5840.9, now and you have three classes other classes you know you have a command to class and a gunner
5840.98,5847.139999999999, class and then a hero class and I won't give you all the details on those but they these are
5847.139999999999,5851.78, the things when the game launches and it's beta form this summer this is what's going to be in there
5851.78,5857.46, and they hope to upgrade it constantly add content to it nonstop and again this is to keep you
5857.46,5861.7, coming back because if you just play for a little bit I mean they need you to constantly view
5861.7,5866.0199999999995, their ad space when you log into the game when you look at the other stuff so if every two weeks
5866.02,5871.540000000001, there's like hey there's something new something substantially new here then that's that's a
5871.540000000001,5875.540000000001, great way to get people coming back in addition to the game just being found on its own so
5876.580000000001,5881.3, and they really say the skies that limit I mean they're willing to entertain any idea they're like
5881.3,5885.46, you know we love see we're big fans of secret weapons in World War II they're like even
5885.46,5890.42, completely bonkers metal slug stuff right now everything's basically inspired by they say
5890.42,5895.38, World War I and World War II everything I've seen as World War II inspired between largely
5896.18,5899.9400000000005, British and German forces but they they just kind of change them to like so the the
5899.9400000000005,5905.3, German inspired guys are called the National Army and it's the royal you know army or something for the other
5906.02,5909.620000000001, but they're they're going to add you know there's only two of those right now but then they're
5909.620000000001,5915.860000000001, going to add more American ones obvious because we have images of guys in American outfits in our
5915.860000000001,5922.02, in our cover story um so they want to add entire armies they're going to add vehicles all the time
5922.42,5926.900000000001, some of them could be like wacky like by planes and stuff like that right others would be
5926.900000000001,5931.14, you know things that you just naturally expect this whole time this I see a rest of the
5931.14,5934.820000000001, I looking out the window and it's just because there is a retronat out there now
5938.42,5944.900000000001, hey um well so what does that mean we're done we're we're winding down is what we're doing okay
5944.900000000001,5948.580000000001, I'm not here next week for the continued version to get the magazine then
5948.74,5954.58, um before I said I didn't get to the medical I saw the retronat I was going to ask you a question
5954.58,5959.0599999999995, no about what you were just talking about well was it
5961.0599999999995,5967.14, yeah shit god damn fucking retronat oh and they're skip he's he's shrugging like what are you
5967.14,5973.0599999999995, gonna do it's for sorry guys so that that all well all I could say to pick this shoes that that
5973.0599999999995,5976.98, that really isn't the half of it there's an entire ride a game there's all these other ways to get
5976.98,5984.5, points in addition just just playing right and doing well joining these like you know other
5984.5,5988.9, factions for the medigame and creating alliances that way and getting points and it's sent it that
5988.9,5994.74, way every week um other stuff with the maps and modes didn't even get the outline and all that
5994.74,6002.82, well we'll have to come back and I guess to it yeah by our magazine right um yeah yeah we have
6003.54,6008.5, so we're gonna go we didn't get the tar crazy cabby story so I'll have to tell that in a couple
6008.5,6013.7, weeks too shone and I had one of the great cab rides of all time well it was good we'll save that for
6013.7,6020.98, some other time and uh in the tuning again if you're annoyed about the rush end of this podcast once again
6020.98,6024.179999999999, as usual you can blame the retronats
