0.0,9.620000000000001, Hello and welcome to the GFW radio that's games for Windows radio podcast for Friday the 12th January
10.28,16.1," 2007 and this is you might have guessed is not Jeff Green. Oh, you should totally done right you should have totally done"
16.1,18.62, That's pretty good. I'm Jeff Green. I mean like it should no-one Jeff Green
19.62,22.86, So we this week we are the ship without a captain and
23.6,29.04, We'll explain that in a minute. Let's first say who's here on the ship the mutiners are me Sean Elliott
30.0,36.8, Gary Gladstone Brian Scott and Sean Maloy and why are we here without a captain gentleman
37.0,40.24, Because Jeff is it has debilitating pneumonia
40.44,44.48," Which is awesome, which isn't funny. Yeah, you start crack it up"
46.480000000000004,51.239999999999995," So yeah, he's came back from his holiday break and"
52.599999999999994,54.6, Instead of being rejuvenated
54.6,58.68," Yeah, I remember he came back in the office like the first day and he was like he had to sweat"
58.68,62.44, And he's like we're trying to like it's tough done and like I think we're all like just do a calm
62.68,67.34," There's no rest. Yeah, I'm looking good that they he was here. Yeah, so yeah, and then as well Jeff"
67.34,71.06, You know somebody right when we were shipping our issues so we just shipped our
73.72,76.74000000000001, Our April your march is marching just shipped off to the printers
76.84,79.88, It Jeff would check it now and then to make sure everything was going fine
79.88,85.11999999999999," And then right after that it was a skeleton crew even more because Darren you went to see yes, and we'll be talking about that today"
85.11999999999999,88.28," Yeah, and so mainly that's what we're gonna be talking about today"
88.28,90.11999999999999, We're getting since we're just getting our ship back together
90.11999999999999,96.44, We'll clear up some rumors about hell gate talk about what Darren saw and what he lost
97.64,103.56, electronic size my sanity and then you know a little of our usual now playing but flip the order do that last today
103.56,105.56, Keep killing your toes
105.56,107.56, So what happens with that Jeff
107.64,109.64, So first off
109.64,112.60000000000001," The big rumor about hell gate okay, so actually this news"
113.88,117.64," Well, it's a rumor news and this is like you know quality reporting all around so"
118.76,121.32000000000001, I would this is actually all happened on the show floor at
121.72,124.68, CES in the Microsoft with them a bunch of games going on
125.08,128.76, You know on display and rope or show it off hell gate and
129.64000000000001,131.64000000000001, I think some dude from shack news
132.44,134.44, Chris from that mistaken he is
134.92,141.16, Talk into rope or in getting a story and I'm actually standing right behind these two while the while the interview is going going on and
142.12,145.64, I don't know where the information came from but there's some kind of rumor out there that
146.76,155.07999999999998, It's like hell gate's gonna be a paid for MMO and I think with a strictly a misquote or just taking out a context because not only do I know that's not the case
155.07999999999998,157.07999999999998, I mean later that day
158.68,162.6, I'm I'm I'm there with I'm hanging out with Bryce for over a day
162.6,166.12, And he's like getting the first like emails back from people about the whole deal
166.12,168.12," Yeah, and he's just scandalous at the time"
168.12,171.48, It was told yeah exactly told scandalous and it's what the hell
172.44,179.24, But I mean like it's such a no so basically what happened here with this whole thing is there was a equivalent of the Chinese whisper got started and
179.56,187.4, Someone read what you're but you're about to explain what the actual well it's content of the message was but it was read as this is going to be
188.36,194.76000000000002, But MMO all of a sudden and not only that you have to pay a monthly fee for it and then due to the Chinese whisper's nature of
195.16,199.0, Online reporting that proliferated everyone wanted to get clicks from the story
199.0,202.12, So just reproduce the story changed the by-line and then now
202.76,206.52, By the end of the day it stood that all of a sudden and now it's fact I mean
206.52,211.8, I mean that's I mean that's a whole other tie rate that I could I could spend a whole hour just going on like how
211.8,217.56, Like in like in like in like you're in an airport just need to like go away and like die in flames
217.56,222.68, Cause like it's weird way it's like it's like you know tab like if you go to supermarked tablids or something
222.68,228.36, Like who can come up with the most absurd you know headline or whatever and you just what the ideas you just want to sell the thing
228.36,232.04000000000002, It doesn't matter and it doesn't matter whether or not you're reporting
233.0,237.72000000000003," News or was true or anything is that you get those clicks and so yeah, it's kind of scary"
237.72,242.52, I mean it kind of pleases itself out there's so many people out there and that becomes another stuff right
242.52,246.68, I know it can end up getting clicks by saying the other clicks that the other person got were bullshit
246.68,248.68, And it were based on and
248.68,252.72, But the price it's like the things then suddenly you're convicted in the eyes
253.04,256.2, You know in the public eye and it's like you know the rumors out there
256.2,261.08, So it's got to be true and then you have to spend like your whole day doing damage control for something that is you know
261.08,265.2, That's exactly the first time there's some people that aren't gonna come back and check or they're going to miss the story
265.2,270.08, Exactly so so you're here to with the explanatory story well. What are they gonna charge for?
270.08,275.44, They're gonna charge for a damn game a box. I mean like basically they've said this pretty much from the beginning
275.44,277.44, I mean that
277.44,282.24, We're all pausing this Ryan Ryan who's smartly dressed in a whole suit in by today
282.4,288.68," Yeah, he looks like somewhere between reservoir dogs and a leapie agent and he's just sort of rolling his eyes all time"
288.68,289.68," No, I"
290.64,295.2," Doesn't like eyeball calcthenics no, I but I mean it's just like it's just kind of like I don't even want to get too deep in"
295.2,299.0, Because it's just a non story really it's stuff that like they've talked about ad nausea
299.0,303.96000000000004, But I thought you were saying earlier to me that that maybe the idea was that they would charge for additional content
303.96000000000004,309.12," Well, right the thing is that they haven't even figured out how they want to roll out that like did you just to be your chin or expansion"
309.12,312.92, Been thinking they don't want to do like as an expansion to your kind of mentality
312.92,317.72, They want to do smaller ones over the course of well they're gonna figure out they're leaving it wide open
317.72,321.88000000000005," They haven't really haven't gone into any of those details yet, but that's like post-reliefs"
321.88000000000005,326.96000000000004, Maybe what they were talking about with the fee was maybe this stuff will be that's exactly it
326.96000000000004,329.56, Like there's a lot there's a lot of hypotheticals out there of how it's gonna work
329.56,332.8, But like the one thing that I want to make sure is that it's just kind of like an open world
332.8,337.40000000000003, You're kind of like it's not I mean how is it guild wars is working right? I mean
338.36,341.8," Right and that you pay once okay, so all right"
342.6,345.8, So so there's that so basically non story how good
345.8,347.8, What else? Okay close
347.8,350.96000000000004, But it is but it is launching in 2000 launching this summer
351.24,353.24, There's the official word
353.24,357.40000000000003," You'll see and they go like no, they're saying it and we have so many games that we're"
358.04,362.06, Now being promised will come out this summer that we'd been promised would have come out this past well
362.06,363.92," I think that well, you know what I think that's the case"
363.92,368.12, I mean like it's like that missing that Christmas window means we're gonna have some good games for the summer
368.12,372.36," Which I'm all for yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're in your out. This is not new"
372.36,374.36, This is not new trend by any means. I mean you go back in
374.92,377.72," Well, you remember the C.G.W Magazine in the pipeline section"
377.72,384.32, And you could always guarantee that whatever month you're reading does the the dates as launch dates you add add to the year to
385.72,388.2, One thing I wasn't sure one thing I always enjoyed was how
389.8,393.66, What was it again? Maybe they'd say it's coming out in in you know December January
393.66,397.8, And then invariably it comes out in March and like holy shit a good game came out in March right and
398.52000000000004,404.12, It's about damn time. I mean like you know stop releasing like 20 great games and you know in September
404.12,406.68, October November and you might actually have people buying beyond good nievel
407.04,409.04," You know, this is true"
409.04,412.56," Okay, but enough of that time right there reminds me. Oh, okay"
412.56,416.28000000000003, I same category I'll come back to it later and we're now playing bit stalker fits that bill yeah
416.28000000000003,420.1," And I got out of build of that and I was playing it, but I'm dying I saw you playing that"
420.1,424.04, So what else what else you got to come back from see yes?
424.12,428.20000000000005," Okay, I played crisis it is all I played it I played through the demo area three times"
428.20000000000005,432.3, It was pretty good is that the stuff we've been seeing in videos for those of us who didn't get to go
432.3,435.52000000000004," Yeah, it's it's really cool. They have a copter fight and"
436.8,441.32000000000005, The AI on that helicopter is pretty like good it's pretty good almost like a little too good still
441.32000000000005,446.20000000000005, But like if like lead it a little and it's still kind of magic if you don't if if it's too far away
446.20000000000005,449.72, It'll like it'll see the rocket coming in and I'll just do it with doing a vase of maneuver cool and
450.52000000000004,452.52000000000004, The superpowers are pretty cool
452.84,456.08," There's still a little tweaking that need they need to fix on the levels, but like I"
456.91999999999996,460.91999999999996, You jack up super strength and you can like lift up a barrel and just chuck it across the
461.4,466.88, Area at somebody right I lift I knocked I lifted up a humv in like and launched it
467.28,473.32," But you know, are there limits to that? I mean does is there like a an equivalent of a stamina meter for when you're using those powers?"
473.32,475.56," Yeah, you know, I don't know"
475.56,480.52," It is like a stamina meter so if it basically I was talking to Shabbat about this. Okay, we're actually Cheybat"
480.52,482.52," I believe this how is yeah, Cheybat"
482.52,484.52," Yeah, anyway, so"
485.08,488.84," I mean I have stories I can't tell about him, but I get out with them at night. Yeah, anyway"
489.71999999999997,491.71999999999997, So
491.71999999999997,494.03999999999996," Yeah, the way he was explaining it to me was"
495.0,500.35999999999996, People can do like almost like a combo system. So basically like if you work it out right you can go from you know super speed
500.84,506.03999999999996, You know not that into strength and like to like he sees he was seeing people on the show floor doing combo moves really
506.52000000000004,511.40000000000003, Sprint really quick up to something grab a barrel which over to strength throw it and then it just kind of like you know
511.40000000000003,516.76, And then work it to the depletion on the energy meter it would just work out perfectly for like right his cool deals
516.84,520.9200000000001," Yeah, it's interesting as long as there's a meter because say if there is no meter. Oh, yeah"
520.9200000000001,524.9200000000001, You might as well almost just enable the game be broke all those it won't send you away
524.9200000000001,527.72," But yeah, I mean since it's easy what you do is you push down the mouse wheel"
527.96,532.12, Bring's up the rosette kind of like in battlefield and if you're used to playing that giving commands really quick
532.2,534.76, You know just how rapidly you can switch between them
534.76,536.76," Yeah, it was really it was really"
536.76,540.76, One of the different directions and let go a mouse three and all of a sudden you're stronger your faster
541.3199999999999,545.8, Me total sense. I mean and like just be able to switch between all the the powers and the weapons and you know
545.8,551.72, Just the way you interact with the world's grain. I can't wait to play it that came like is all one of those like you know when when
552.04,555.56, Something console and it's when the next generation you know because they're clearly
556.12,558.4399999999999, Tomorrow Katie wonders new generation something comes out
558.6,562.76," When you get that tag less and you see it and you're like oh, I got to play that like you don't even care"
562.84,569.56, You just imagine your head like that comes out taking a couple days off from just gonna sit there and look at every flower and like punch every wall
569.56,571.88, Just to see what happens. I mean I totally get that just watch
572.28,574.76, You're gonna have a PC that's gonna be able to run this damn thing
575.4,579.16," Yeah, I'll make it I worried that's that's like what was like for half like to"
579.64,584.68," Okay, that was the question. It's not if I'm it's just like yeah, we'll win the game come out so I have to have and that's it"
585.3199999999999,587.96," And especially after the you know, I mean I don't want to jump too far"
587.96,591.4," I could have when I spoke focus in the games, but there was you know with the wind tunnel announcements the show"
591.48,594.52, Vista you know officially a official launch of quad core gaming
595.24,597.48, I mean basically I'm telling people wait
598.04,604.76, Just wait until the prices start coming down on the quad cores right and wait until the crisis is out because that's gonna sell systems
605.88,609.64," DX10 all over that yeah, so DX10 everywhere well"
609.64,614.28," Yeah, well, I wouldn't say everywhere. I mean it wasn't fully the only game that I saw it fully implemented in was"
614.6,619.16, Age of Conan or she's another good game that I was checking out at the show and and that's kind of one of those
619.9599999999999,625.8," We've covered it a couple times like in illusory ups and drabs, but it's like one of those it I think it has a potentially like one of those sleeper games"
626.04,629.88, That I mean I was just you couldn't help but just stare at it
629.88,635.16, There were two games that surprised me both you and John Davis and who's part of the zip-daves game group
635.16,639.16, And back and said hey guess what age of Conan and
640.04,647.0, Low and behold yeah shadow run. I was gonna say I'm looking really cool. I'm about to like totally like eat my words from like previous
647.56,652.28," Podcasts, I mean, so why is Shadow Run like you know what it I mean like graphically it still has to you know"
652.28,656.76," It's still getting beefed up. I think it's on for like March release March April, so I got"
657.56,665.48, I mean it's a you know it's just a fun multiplayer shooter. I mean like the the implementation of powers on top of it is just kind of interesting like
666.28,669.88," One of the magic abilities is like teleport for example, so it's like a short form teleport"
669.88,674.92, You can like jump ahead or or wherever up down whatever so like imagine like instead of bunny hopping
674.92,680.68, You're teleporting around someone as you're shooting him. So how does that work do you like point at a spot and hit well if you're if you're walking forward
680.68,682.1999999999999, You hit the teleport button
682.1999999999999,687.4, You jump ahead you're pushing back you jump back and you that would be fun to do when you're the one teleporting
687.4,690.5999999999999, But how annoying is it when you're fighting so and it just keeps popping in and that's true
690.5999999999999,696.04, I mean like it's all the balancing I've I've closed playing the PC version and the 360 version and you could do that while you're fighting
696.04,700.36," Yeah, because I mean because obviously telepitation's been a big part of the unreal series"
700.36,704.1999999999999," Yeah, well, I mean it was also been part of Quake however in Quake"
704.2,709.24, It's just an escape teleport you know it's the startup and you hit the button and you randomly jump somewhere right it was
709.24,713.5600000000001, It was in a scene well it was in a escape teleport to a limited degree or it's our tactical move in
713.5600000000001,717.0, U.T. But you just isn't a weapon if you were good
717.0,721.6400000000001," Yeah, but the thing is like here this like you're unable to do from the beginning to I mean we'll not from the beginning"
721.6400000000001,726.9200000000001, But if you pick this power right I mean that is a part of the gameplay and then there's other stuff to there's vision enhancements
726.9200000000001,728.5200000000001, So you could see through you know
729.08,731.08, Sharp revision shoot through walls whatever
731.4000000000001,738.2, She threw all his rather I mean I think it's this is the hard part about the schemes because whenever someone describes it whenever you look at the screens you're like
739.44,741.44," Yeah, what's the big deal you know"
741.44,747.5400000000001, You know it's and I and I totally believe you just because of games like I mean that's the same thing like I was playing open arena all morning
747.5400000000001,748.5400000000001," Yeah, I was kidding quick"
748.5400000000001,752.24, Three right now and that's one of those games where it doesn't matter I mean even now
752.24,756.1800000000001," It just doesn't matter that yeah, there's it's got the central weapons that you have in every game"
756.1800000000001,760.86, And there's nothing but some mazes go around and blow the shit out of each other because it's like it's just so much
760.86,764.72," Fun, but when you tell people I mean imagine right in a preview on that game now"
764.72,770.16," It's like okay, so you got these mazes and you got in you got a rocket launcher"
770.32,775.14, You know and you can there's these little teleporters you can go in and you just go around and you blow people up
775.14,777.14, You know I
777.14,779.14, Know it it's
780.14,781.86, It's so hard to get like behind it
781.86,784.74," But I mean like when you start describing it, but it's just it's just fun"
784.74,790.92, I mean you put you sit that you're asked out of the controls and it's just like it's just like going back to like the quick three days
790.92,792.92, And you're there and it's very simple
793.92,797.88, You know it's like I mean I always said from the beginning it was a counter strike with fireballs and shit
797.88,800.2, But was the live anywhere hooked up was yeah
800.2,803.7, It was a it was a piece of guys playing against you know each other and
804.5,808.62, 360 guys and it was just happened I saw in the videos there's some pretty vicious
809.34,814.32, Amosist on the console version. They're they're tweaking that actually I was talking to vicious in like
814.74,816.74, Just like my little nutty maybe playing it
817.74,822.74," Training wheels and a half you know, I mean you look in the guys like and the opponent's jumping and using his"
823.02,826.8, Glider ability and you just see the crosshair like walking itself
827.1,829.1, You know across the screen to chase the guy
829.3,834.22," Yeah, I mentioned that to those guys and I mean there obviously still tweaking it, but I think like the important part of it"
834.22,839.46, They want to keep it balance just you know accuracy versus like just too much of a handholding thing right right
839.46,841.46, So there's a PC version feel like
842.02,846.5400000000001, Something was missing because it was obviously being made for like a 32 no
846.5400000000001,853.8000000000001, It felt like a first person shooter like like in fellow like any other shooter that I had the only my only regret is that it's such a deep rich world
853.8000000000001,858.0, That they're playing with here and they could have done so much more and I was talking to Mitch
858.0,861.48, I think it's gentleman. I'm I'm blanking right now
861.48,867.96, But the guys from day one studios these are guys who were you know previously they did the mech commander games and I and I the first thing I said to him was mech commander
867.96,871.32, Three let's do that because I mean I love that series if you ever check that out
871.32,874.32, It's awesome awesome RTS game but
875.0400000000001,882.32," Yeah, no, but I mean like they these guys have worked with fastest stuff for years so they know the deal and they understand the material and"
883.32,886.9200000000001, I think there's a lot of potential here and it's as long as people give it the try
886.9200000000001,892.0400000000001," Yeah, another another different fastest. You know, I don't own limb because I feel it all like a shadow run game"
892.04,896.4," Or is it was never playing it you're thinking yeah, this is shadow run or you think I'm like no, that's the net"
896.4,901.76," Yeah, you know what a lot of the criticism I've seen is because it's not an RPG that's exactly"
901.76,907.0, I think I think the problem is I only I only play like one or two arenas and typically to me
907.0,912.1999999999999, Shadow on us like these dark cyber punky magical things and I didn't have enough of that
912.1999999999999,916.36, I feel it's kind of the way the way the way Mitch described it to me when I was playing the game
917.4,920.4, He was saying it's like imagine like going these as you're going on those
920.4,924.0799999999999," You know covert missions, you know like you go in and try to hack a computer or something"
924.0799999999999,930.04, This is the result of the escape. This this action is like what would happen in the escape part or whatever right
930.4399999999999,935.28, So that's the way he was kind of describing like a scenario. So I mean does it feel told in like it
936.0,941.04, Not a hundred percent because you know what I still maintain if you check out the the half-life two-mod dystopia
941.4,945.72, There's some really cool side hacking in there and you've played it right right?
946.6800000000001,949.36, So I mean like if they if they did more of that I'd be really psyched
949.36,954.08," Well, I mean yeah, like in that game actually there's a cyberspace. There's a whole virtual way"
954.08,957.9200000000001, But it's already the virtual space because that's like a big part at least in my head about Shadow right it was
958.12,962.24," Well, that's the whole thing that's I guess it's perspective of like what people like"
962.24,967.28, I mean like because the game was so vastly different you could play it however you wanted right and there was a very big steam
967.28,971.96, a cyber punk element. There's also this high fantasy meets for the real world element too
971.96,974.5600000000001, So I just wish to as more of that cyber punk stuff
975.52,982.1999999999999, What else did I say next next okay held gate check agent conflict world and conflict yes that game looked awesome
982.7199999999999,987.3199999999999, They're having some computer problems like the two times I walk back I kept like overheating because the way they built the booth
987.3199999999999,989.3199999999999, But the game looks sweet and
989.92,991.92, fully dex 10 compliant
991.92,997.76, So it's gonna have all the bells and whistles and I'm now you know how and there's there's same this should be possible
998.0799999999999,1002.28," Dual screen now. I think it's you know it sounds kind of silly that I even care about this now, but ever since Supreme Commander"
1002.28,1004.28, I can see so much potential in this
1004.68,1007.0799999999999, Who do you know has a two-screen setup?
1007.0799999999999,1012.7199999999999, I dare it I actually you know I go out much more or like we need to have two monitors side by side and they are two
1012.7199999999999,1014.28, Television that is you know
1014.28,1016.52, I got it and also I got it for the record
1017.52,1020.7199999999999, Because everyone's trying to do it with with I mean shit
1020.7199999999999,1023.9, They try to get you to do it with three of them yeah racing games. Yeah
1024.3999999999999,1027.3999999999999," Well, like PS2 games. Well show you play you played supreme commander"
1027.3999999999999,1033.44, I did and you would definitely benefit from two months right because I mean you were telling me how like and I totally believe it
1033.44,1038.3600000000001, How is your play on on one monitor you basically start playing the whole game from that side
1038.3600000000001,1041.96, Light view and you don't appreciate all the cool graphics that are happening because you have to operate everything
1041.96,1046.88," That's some sorry you should though, you know you know when when mom and I say this for like the 35 year old dude"
1047.6000000000001,1053.56," Mom and she comes in and he's sitting there like 35 year old is just like no, but just rounding and Taco Bell rapper"
1053.56,1057.8, You got to do this monitor there and each is a different readout and he's like
1057.8,1062.56," Scan around and like choking on his own hand rolls, you know"
1064.44,1069.9199999999998, I have two tangents to go on one try to try taking a talk about hot sauce packets sometime and put on a really rusty penny
1070.1599999999999,1073.68, It's a little less your Mr. Sight Mr. Wizard side talk about taste like a painting
1074.12,1076.44, Now you know why it tastes like a penny next
1078.8,1080.8, I just got really why
1080.8,1086.26," Solid one of those in the universe and then yeah, I got this way guys the two monitors and like Amy my"
1086.26,1089.5," Yes, my fiance she she's like are you a freaking stock broker now?"
1089.5,1090.5, You're retarded
1090.5,1092.5," Yeah, see that's what I'm a bad"
1092.5,1098.04, But I got a terrible actually so for listeners out there who are anywhere near our Costco
1098.04,1102.7, I got two monitors for 250 bucks a piece so I get it's not that expensive
1102.7,1105.44, So you can get a good amount you can get a good size 22 inch monitor
1106.12,1110.1599999999999," Put them to both together and get a flat screen flat screen. Yeah, I cannot see her table in 22 inch"
1110.8,1112.8, With 16 by 10 resolution
1112.8,1114.8, Rocket like it's a DS
1114.8,1117.76," Yeah, I'll be touching one screen. Just get you so"
1117.76,1122.24," And yeah, I mean it's obviously hardcore enough for everyone, but I'm looking forward to it"
1122.8799999999999,1126.32, Because I'm speaking things that you've you buy recently
1126.32,1131.44," I heard you you've lost some stuff. Oh, thank you. Thanks for bringing up that fun memory you piece of crap"
1133.28,1137.8799999999999, There's another before like you need a moment to collect yourself on that so as we like
1138.44,1141.44, stall on what Darren lost we got to talk about
1142.5200000000002,1144.98, What's up what's this message? I'm getting the break my
1148.98,1155.1200000000001," I'm gonna hold the break off one minute because I need to tell you please. It's very important now. Okay, so to go with those two monitors"
1155.1200000000001,1160.94, We have another offering coming out in peace and land there and you know about this. This is for all you railroad conductor
1160.94,1168.14, I know this one basically what you do is you buy this hardware and it's it's flashing lights that you've set up in your room
1168.14,1172.94, And then and the X and a fan that blows on you so as you're simulating
1173.42,1177.3400000000001, Conducting a train which as far as I'm aware consists of pulling a lever upper down
1177.42,1180.14, But it's blowing in your face and it's it's
1181.1000000000001,1184.3, Flashing lights to put you an athletic seizure whatever you need and
1184.78,1189.48," Yeah, that's that's it. So that now we can take the break. Okay, well, I actually and it'll be the cliff"
1189.48,1192.96, It'll make it want to come back come back for that. I'm not worried goodbye
1199.64,1201.32," Oh hello, I didn't see there"
1201.32,1208.52," But as long as you're here, let me tell you about EGM live the weekly podcast from the editors of electronic giving monthly along with the wonderful sounds of"

1253.72,1257.5600000000002," You hear that I don't know about that. Well, I can picture that made the cover of wired magazine years ago"
1257.5600000000002,1260.28, Like this is holding there a talking about doing where basically it would like simulate

1265.18,1269.5600000000002, You look at the PC and like you're trying to gain like that. Let's let's say you're going through the sewer
1270.92,1272.92, Strittling on relative rotting
1275.96,1277.96, Awesome
1277.96,1280.3600000000001, Not one-price it was still like Ryan's house or something
1282.8400000000001,1286.76," No, anyway, so this is Phil Philips like trying to do this. It's called"
1287.16,1293.8400000000001, AMBX and BX or whatever they were calling it and they're selling these lights and fans and they're trying to sell it put this API in a bunch of games
1293.8400000000001,1298.28, I think they demoed one for me. I just sworn it was like company heroes even
1299.24,1302.84," For the fan blown on you, but it's like a shell comes in"
1303.32,1306.12, That was a house or shell to sort of buy you and you feel like the suit
1308.36,1311.8799999999999," Well, you know what I that was all a while ago and I know we're gonna review unit"
1312.04,1318.2, It a little bit so I'll set up my office. We'll get a we'll have a fanning show there nice. I know it could crop dust in
1318.92,1320.92, I'll hook you up on the outside of that fan
1320.92,1324.92," Oh, yeah, okay"
1325.96,1329.0, One of uncomfortable silence. So what did you lose it's a yes?
1329.48,1336.92," Okay, you know, here's a travel tip for everyone make sure if you're leaving your room for any period of time to put it and it's put anything valuable in the safe"
1337.88,1339.0800000000002, So
1339.0800000000002,1347.0," I my digital camera my recorder my DS and all its games all gone. Oh, yeah, so that was fun"
1347.24,1353.32, I wasn't that was pretty happy so basically all my interviews on all the pictures I took at the show all gone like you weren't even there
1353.32,1354.52, It's like it
1354.52,1357.96, Maybe I wasn't and aside from that you had which was due for this issue
1358.2,1359.96, So folks here's a story that
1359.96,1361.96," Yeah, meant to be and"
1361.96,1366.36, Weeks and weeks ago you had a great and extended interview with one John Carmack
1367.16,1372.84, And so that was not a bit up as far as we we know right now. I'm trying to recover it from a from from else
1372.84,1377.0," So someone's jam into that playing your DS and well, I actually that that's a good point"
1377.0,1382.52, So if someone actually post that interview with John Carmack and it had all the details of his next game
1382.9199999999998,1384.9199999999998, That down to the design documents
1386.1999999999998,1388.9199999999998, Now you just started a straightest story shit on there
1389.8,1391.6399999999999," Yeah, and next thing next thing you need to know"
1391.6399999999999,1396.04, Plans out there. I know well now everyone yeah all those bloggers can just make up what they want
1396.4399999999998,1400.52," John Carmack's game revealed it's uh, I don't know what is it"
1401.24,1402.52, Train conductor's in you
1403.72,1406.2," For self-approved yeah, no, but yeah, so"
1407.08,1409.08, That's so so John
1410.12,1415.16, Anyone over the PR firm Wendy if you hear this I need to make another phone call at some point sorry
1416.44,1420.92," Yeah, I hope they can find it anyway, so yeah, so seriously guys that sucked"
1421.24,1425.8, So that wasn't the middle of the day. I know what happened was I I got in I dropped off my bags
1425.8,1428.76," I'm like okay, I you know I got to go game back"
1429.08,1436.6, I grabbed my stuff for day one went back to the room dropped it off and then when date when day two came up I had to I had to you know go with
1437.24,1440.2, Interviews and stuff and it was already gone like I don't know I
1440.68,1444.04, So there's no sign of four century right so this is clearly they had I
1444.44,1448.68, Will things access to the key card or they have something that can basically do the
1449.8799999999999,1451.8799999999999, That didn't have any records of unusual activity
1452.28,1457.08, They didn't have any like you know I check I check with hotel security they didn't have an unusual records of what happened
1457.56,1463.72, So I'm just like well only like what what can I do so I went out and bought a DS and like maybe it was whoever you're sharing that room with
1464.9199999999998,1466.9199999999998, No
1466.9199999999998,1468.9199999999998," Think about that no, we know there"
1469.8799999999999,1472.36, Kind of playing homekeeping housekeeping
1473.3999999999999,1474.6, How's keeping a play with the
1475.24,1476.52, Oh
1476.52,1478.52," Yeah, yeah, do that"
1478.76,1482.12," What'd you do that man someone comfortable right now? Yeah, that's play enough"
1482.1999999999998,1484.1999999999998, Right
1484.52,1488.12," Yeah, so I'm right let's hear from you like talk it what's on your mind right now dude"
1489.08,1491.56, Just do nothing the whole podcast but make faces
1492.28,1498.12, Think about tucky tells what it what's behind that I'm tired today all right good man have some more red bull
1499.6399999999999,1501.6399999999999, Yeah
1501.6399999999999,1505.2399999999998," Okay, so the other okay besides the games that were on the show floor I'll just quickly run through"
1506.04,1509.3999999999999, So I basically was like the wind tells show because the big news was obviously you know
1509.48,1511.4, Vista which is gonna be launching the end of this month
1511.96,1517.72, Intel officially rolled out the quad core CPU and they had a bunch of computers on the show floor that
1517.72,1521.4, Our worth was awesome it. I mean like I think there was one season even had like eight core
1522.3600000000001,1525.88, It's like like over the top like you know down the road. What does that octocore?
1527.5600000000002,1529.8000000000002," No, but I'm just saying the whole point there is"
1530.52,1534.44, This is the year like everyone was talking about like what the PC can do in your home
1534.44,1539.48, Me you know whether it's a media center it's the center of your your network tone
1540.76,1541.96, refrigerator
1541.96,1545.56," Seriously, I mean like that's all I mean I think it's they've been having this convergence talk for 10 years"
1545.56,1550.28," Yeah, it's like everyone fell asleep and like five years ago and said hey the soul converted things kind of cool"
1550.28,1552.76, And they woke up before the show and so let's try it now
1553.24,1558.44, So everyone has these weird approaches like Samsung is making a wireless a wireless TV
1558.68,1562.2, So that you can like hook up your blue ray player without having a plug-in wires
1562.3600000000001,1564.3600000000001, It'll transmit all the data to your TV
1564.52,1567.96, So it's kind of it's stuff like that. They're trying that that's kind of interesting but at the same point
1569.32,1573.48, These years kind of like there was no like one big electronics thing everyone's at holy crap
1573.48,1577.72, I got to get that and then and then was it day two of the show Apple
1578.1200000000001,1581.16, What did the iPhone that was the iPhone and then there's a tumble leads at the show
1581.96,1587.24, I should have brought it in you had speaking of convergence you brought the flyer in for the PDA that also has a breathalizer
1587.24,1590.68," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the kind of like convergence"
1590.68,1592.68," I'm talking about yeah, no, actually"
1593.88,1597.16," There's an MP3 playing breath. Oh, you know it"
1598.44,1601.64, Turn off the sound. It sounds good. I would have drunk I really am
1603.16,1606.76," Do it. Oh, all right, it's all the Italian AJ shit"
1608.68,1610.68, It's like the song based on your
1610.68,1616.3600000000001," I don't know I was fastened by that. Oh, they also the same company also makes a a kiss on a kissometer"
1616.8400000000001,1619.0800000000002, It tests it tests your breath for how bad it is
1620.76,1622.68, So that was one of those things
1625.16,1629.4, That should be a mandatory thing for all gamers they get the you have to buy the breath at the kissometer
1630.92,1634.92, That is convergence everyone this is CBS my friend that is the future
1635.3200000000002,1638.92," So yeah, that's that's the really the the quick and dirty two second report bigger TVs"
1639.48,1641.88," You know $80,000, 800, eight inch TVs"
1641.88,1643.88, Any robot?
1643.88,1645.96," Yeah, there's there's there's there's the room was of the world"
1646.28,1648.28, There's all like crazy stuff. I mean
1648.84,1652.68, The funny thing was I ran into a a body of mine from a competing magazine
1652.68,1653.8799999999999, I asked so I meant you
1653.8799999999999,1655.8799999999999," You uh, I haven't good show"
1655.8799999999999,1657.8799999999999," He's just and he goes yeah, I've seen so much great stuff on like"
1658.36,1661.24, Are you the same show? I mean like this is a lot of stuff was just rehashed from last year
1661.96,1665.3999999999999, Or E3 I mean like they had the noven falcon on display which is still looks cool right?
1665.3999999999999,1667.3999999999999, Did they have any new apps for that thing?
1667.3999999999999,1670.52, Which by the way for everyone the noven falcon is a haptic
1671.6399999999999,1677.48, Interface we're basically you hold a ball and it creates is it becomes a control or you just for pc games and it creates
1678.36,1684.68," Disensation of various textures in your hands various weights and resistances. Yeah, so if you picked up a physical object and have like two"
1684.68,1690.36, It felt like you were lifting something or you could throw a ball and catch a ball and if you just sort of like rocks back
1690.36,1692.36, So right to get a thing yeah with this here
1692.76,1697.32," Well, they're still kind of coming along there's they're original hopes we're to get it out like before Christmas"
1697.32,1699.32, But that just wasn't in the cards
1699.56,1703.6399999999999, There it's looking more like you know Q3 maybe a hundred bucks tops
1703.96,1705.64, But you know what if there's gonna be a master placement
1705.96,1711.16, This is pretty pretty damn sweet now just to give you like a full explanation if you haven't like you can you look it up online
1711.48,1713.48, It's like three tensor arms
1713.48,1715.48, Each one a
1715.48,1721.0," Exactly, they actually actually sit three separate motors right so each one's self-actuated and and it totally"
1721.4,1726.2, It's just awesome. I was playing a basketball game where you like you lift it up and like you're gonna like raise and lower the others people
1726.2,1730.1200000000001, Not aware of the mechanisms aside. They go to pick it up and it just seems like some sort of magic you know
1730.5200000000002,1733.4," Right, but I'm but I'm but the fact is like you you you actually"
1733.4,1739.88, Feels like you have something in your hand right and you feel the feel a little attention exactly and that's just so damn cool
1739.88,1743.8000000000002, I mean I'm gonna make you I don't think it's gonna make you I mean for in terms of immersion
1743.88,1748.2800000000002, It's definitely a huge enhancement. It's not gonna enhance your your performance. Oh no
1748.2800000000002,1749.3200000000002, In a game or whatever
1749.3200000000002,1752.92, So basically you have you have that you couple it with some some some some some blowers
1753.4,1757.24, Some some coin bags and then like you're you're in the matrix man. That's it
1757.24,1762.2800000000002, I support is obviously like the maker break thing for that thing. What well what's going to be supported?
1762.76,1766.2," Well, the thing was they said that it's like it took one guy a week"
1767.48,1771.8799999999999, We're not even that like like a really short period of time to add the API into half life too
1772.44,1774.44, So if that was the actions of one man
1775.08,1779.6399999999999," At this you know, he's just working on this on his own right I mean I mean I actually if you had like a team of guys"
1779.6399999999999,1784.52, Or if you had the API already built and you could pass it on like if you make one for the Unreal 3 engine
1784.52,1787.6399999999999, It's gonna be instantly embedded into how many different games
1787.64,1792.2800000000002, But here's here's the other thing to to fully and and holy utilize this thing
1792.68,1796.92, I mean like let's look at examples of like Nintendo because they're usually gone on a limb and yeah
1796.92,1799.16, Introduce a new interface first or at least they have recently
1799.48,1803.0, You know with both the DS and the we so if you're accompanying you're like okay
1803.0,1809.5600000000002, We can in a day we can more or less convert the controls of this game to the Wii Remote or something like splinter stuff
1809.5600000000002,1814.64," Yeah, which is what they did that alone isn't and what what you then have is the same game that works with that"
1814.64,1821.44, You need to really show up but it does you want to essentially create a game that relies on your intuitive sense of weight and texture
1821.44,1825.1200000000001, I mean you could even solve puzzles just exclusively by running your hand over
1825.1200000000001,1830.8000000000002, You know and there is like find the key taped underneath the desk by just running your hand underneath the desk
1830.8000000000002,1833.68, And you could do something like absolutely but to really do that
1834.0,1839.8000000000002, You'd have to have a whole lot of investment in it and that assumes that there's enough people that the product is already hit critical mass
1839.8000000000002,1841.8000000000002, Where enough people had it where it's gonna drive sales
1841.8,1848.12," Right, you know got that chicken and egg problem there worried like neither the chicken never hatches and the chicken never lays a leg and nothing"
1849.48,1855.3999999999999," No, and you're totally right and the thing is I think they realize that as well and that's why they they're making smart partnerships with"
1856.68,1858.68, Companies where it makes sense of like
1858.68,1861.9199999999998, H year right now is kind of in that same boat there. I was that was the next
1861.9199999999998,1865.04, So and so they're actually they're actually working together to a degree
1865.04,1868.6399999999999, I mean if you take a look at the they were demoing self self-actor
1868.64,1875.48," Right, that's the showcase game for what HGF physics can do now imagine you add the HGF physics and the ability to feel the weight of each of the objects"
1875.48,1877.96, You're manipulating that's like the first step
1877.96,1880.2800000000002, You really cool. So there's already a bunch of games that are actually doing it like
1881.1200000000001,1885.16, There's been some news leaking out about net devils next game warm-onger
1885.48,1887.64," Yeah, I was like before I heard about that"
1887.64,1893.92, I mean I was ready to just assume that the whole physics card thing is just dead in the water now because with quad core
1894.48,1899.52, Being able to handle the same you know physics case and distribute know this like okay
1899.52,1900.92," Well, why do we need the card anymore?"
1900.92,1906.04," Well, you know this is like well, maybe you don't need the card and then thing is that's that's kind of what's smart about the physics"
1907.04,1909.04, API is that it basically it's
1909.76,1912.1200000000001, No-bodex software basically it's a competitor of havoc
1912.48,1914.48, That's what's being used for
1915.1200000000001,1916.48, HG is physics
1916.48,1920.24, So basically if you don't have the card it still works physics
1920.8,1924.44, The physics application is still residing on your computer and it's gonna work and it's gonna do physics
1924.44,1929.28, So you have software solution the hardware is just like an added bonus so basically if you had quad core in physics
1929.28,1930.92, And then you know
1930.92,1934.1200000000001, PHPHYX you had those it's still gonna it's still gonna work
1934.4,1942.6," So you're out your cover either way right, but in terms of selling I mean it's selling the hardware that's not enough to sell another right you know another hard for your right"
1942.6,1944.6, But I'm saying like I
1944.6,1946.6, Hope that
1946.6,1950.48, This is our chance let's turn this to like the one up your show or something you know how
1950.48,1957.52, Which what if we've been missing it you've got to irrationally suddenly and irrationally care all hell of a lot for the physics card
1957.52,1962.24," All be out the hate all right, Darren you're just you know that's a fucking piece of trash"
1962.24,1965.9599999999998, And I've been telling you this for so long you just won't listen to your freaking 80
1965.9599999999998,1968.9199999999998, You don't know what the hell you're talking about you don't know tech at all
1968.9199999999998,1970.9199999999998, And all the part
1970.9199999999998,1972.9199999999998, We did
1972.92,1974.92, She met and hasn't outside of our window
1975.8000000000002,1982.1200000000001," He's like the king of the Sony side okay, so there here's which you're not understanding what physics is card's gonna do"
1982.1200000000001,1988.52, It's gonna enable me to play with an enhanced physics. I'm gonna have you know over 40 p40 objects on screen moving
1988.52,1993.68, It's no time they're all gonna be moving not 10 you only got 10 right now. You only got 10 what are you gonna do with our physics card? Come on
1994.0800000000002,1996.0800000000002, That's end of my story
1996.0800000000002,2000.0800000000002, You're not you just biased against it if you if you're I against it you would have physics
2000.08,2002.08, I
2006.8799999999999,2009.28, That's what that's what we need to know controversy
2010.96,2015.8799999999999," Okay, so moving along actually let me just say one last thing on this time not even on the physics side"
2015.8799999999999,2020.8799999999999, But more on the net level side now these are guys who like they come up with like one good idea after
2020.8799999999999,2025.0," No, they just they need to create a game that people are just gonna get behind and buy because like auto assault"
2025.52,2029.96, Awesome game who was playing where they need to get someone who's got a game
2030.08,2035.72," That everyone's gonna buy to get behind them like what if crisis, but I mean even then like if if it was an option"
2035.72,2038.3999999999999, They would have what if like crisis is something it's like you have to have
2039.08,2043.1599999999999, Which they're never gonna do but I mean it's so kind of scenario like that it would work
2043.1599999999999,2048.2," You know, I mean it's like you had like like the equivalent for the for the weaver a lot of people in a category"
2048.2,2052.4," It's like Zelda. Yeah, but I guess you don't have to have you can get the game cute one. I don't know what I'm talking about"
2052.4,2054.4, Let's go back to the house
2062.4,2064.4," So hi, I don't even know I'm high"
2066.4,2068.4," All right, so moving along"
2070.52,2074.96, Let's we we we really talk about now playing we've all been playing a good amount of stuff
2074.96,2080.88, I mean we had a Christmas break to play or holiday break if you will to play as much stuff as as we wanted
2080.88,2084.2400000000002, I got a whole lot of a lot of games in maybe I should start
2084.2400000000002,2090.58," I don't know please do hey, so I guess I should talk about stalker first and sorry T's that that game came in and"
2091.6,2096.02, I don't know what the deal is but it's not running very well for me at first
2096.56,2101.32, When I started it just it's having issues with you. That's what we get it's not it's not the review code
2101.32,2106.08, Have you tried it on your home PC as opposed to the work one? I don't dare explain home PC's a piece of shit right now
2106.08,2108.96, I heard to the one I have here the one that I rejiggered for you I
2109.28,2114.36," That one's not working well load windows won't run windows, but the hell they weren't for day"
2114.36,2120.0, And I can I I enabled me to play some dark messiah long last because the word PC wasn't playing it
2120.56,2122.32, But I'll get to that in a second so anyway
2122.7200000000003,2128.7200000000003, It did run well enough so that I was able to explore try a few things out and the coolest thing about stalker's like
2129.12,2131.52, I mean I've been writing about it here in it for so long
2131.52,2135.08, But I realized I'd never got to play it and so as soon as I played I'm like wait a minute
2135.08,2138.04, This is cool. You know what this is this is a blivion FPS and
2138.44,2142.4, I mean maybe all for some reason like I guess when we wrote about it no one ever said that
2142.56,2144.7999999999997, But like that's all I needed to know like okay
2144.7999999999997,2150.16, That's what this game is about so explain what you mean by but so by saying that it's like you start off in a base
2150.16,2154.68, You're talking to a you know you're talking to a guy and you go outside and all of a sudden
2154.68,2158.2799999999997, You're like wow just huge atmospheric world it looks great you can see
2158.72,2161.4, For a million miles the mountains aren't as high right from the beginning
2161.4,2162.7599999999998, so you don't know just how big it is
2162.92,2164.36, but
2164.44,2168.44, What you do from there where you go is pretty much up to you you can make some contacts in this town
2169.2400000000002,2173.48, It very very very cool. I mean everyone you approach someone and if you have your gun drawn
2173.7200000000003,2177.6400000000003, They'll like pull their gun on you and they'll react to you differently. They'll be like what the hell you know
2178.6400000000003,2180.6400000000003, So then
2180.6400000000003,2181.6400000000003, Get in there
2181.6400000000003,2186.44, I'm talking to a guy and he'll give you like hey you want to hear here's something you want to go meet up with my friends
2186.44,2188.0, I need him to come back here
2188.0,2191.7200000000003, So that might be your first official mission you go and do that you meet them and
2192.2799999999997,2197.3199999999997," And they're like hey, do you want us to just go back and talk to the guy for you or do you want to hang out with us?"
2197.3199999999997,2201.4399999999996, We actually want to do this here. Then there's like the first branch and you get yourself another
2202.3599999999997,2207.68," Okay, what's it's going on? I don't know. I just get my time check. That's okay. So you get yourself another another another mission option there"
2207.7999999999997,2209.0, So
2209.0,2213.7599999999998," For example, what happened I'm out walking around and you know their helicopter's flying by there's all these"
2213.7599999999998,2219.3999999999996, Electromagnetic anomalies that I can kind of see in the distance and leaves blowing around the grass blowing and stuff
2219.64,2224.08," Looks like it's about to rain it definitely feels like into the world scenario, you know"
2225.12,2228.7200000000003," Which is really cool. I just read that corn or Carth he's the road. Oh, yeah, yeah"
2228.7200000000003,2229.52, It's got that
2229.52,2234.36," Somebody guys been reckoned some. Yeah, it's an awesome book, but it's got that vibe where you just like okay"
2235.36,2241.6800000000003, Anyone you meet can be ready to kill you or each you or whatever the case may be and you need to survive in this environment
2241.6800000000003,2245.78," So it's very cool like that, but so I meet these guys and they agreed to you know"
2245.78,2248.86, Don't don't hang out with me and we'll act as a group so we go into this next camp
2249.1800000000003,2253.9, And we find some squatters there and we want to fight them and this cool fight in the season
2253.9,2258.5800000000004, It's like I have the guys on my side help me and we're fighting them and instead of them all being ready for some
2258.5800000000004,2263.7000000000003," Immediately, they have to get up from what they're doing some of them like a caught one that somehow didn't wake up during the fight"
2263.7000000000003,2269.94, And was still sleeping over by a fire and I woke him up and he was confused. You didn't know if like I was there to kill him or if like what the hell was going on
2269.94,2273.3," So he didn't just start shooting me immediately, you know like shitty AI would do"
2273.3,2279.78, And then like you know I lost I ended up all my everyone ended up getting killed except for me in that whole altercation
2279.78,2282.5800000000004, I'm kind of wandering around some more and then like I see
2283.6200000000003,2288.94, You know I run into some weird mutant dogs that are out roaming around and they're eating corpses and then some other big like
2289.0600000000004,2293.86, Mutant hog things come and they're then they start chasing the dogs and then I piss them all off
2293.86,2299.1400000000003, And then they're all chasing me so I run into this other town and they come in and then everyone in the town just starts fighting
2299.14,2304.3399999999997, And that fight in the monsters off and stuff and it's just got that I mean like maybe I really don't know
2304.3399999999997,2310.06, It's only gonna take a great deal of experience to see just how cool the AI is and in the same way that that with you know
2310.06,2315.94," Without a scrolls for oblivion. They were you know, they tagged it emergent. I mean I radiant AI and it was supposed to do this that and the other thing"
2316.18,2322.58," And at the end of the day, maybe it didn't quite do all those things, but it did enough but the fun part was when you first got that game"
2323.14,2327.7799999999997, And when you get any kind of game like that you don't know what the boundaries are you have to push them and find out
2327.78,2333.0600000000004, So it's really cool for me at the point where I'm at now is because I'm still pushing them. You know how big is this world?
2333.3,2338.5800000000004, Like just what is the AI capable of but that kind of thing is never there in a game like say I mean
2338.5800000000004,2342.6600000000003," No knock on it, but like if you're playing you know called duty three or something that just doesn't exist"
2342.6600000000003,2347.38," You know you're basically going down a trail. Oh, yeah, and the contours of which are obscured to you because"
2348.6600000000003,2353.78, It's to be honest with you. I'm about to act in but in this you definitely are like I can do all these different things
2353.78,2358.1800000000003, And I have no idea what's gonna happen. It's probably gonna be fatal for me to try this but I'm gonna do it anyway
2358.1800000000003,2359.7000000000003," You know, it's just all like a side"
2359.7000000000003,2366.34, Quest you were going on or is this a side quest and from the very beginning the first guy you speak to there over 20 things
2366.34,2370.5600000000004, You could choose to do from him the guy the first guy is just kind of like like a middleman for
2370.5600000000004,2373.0," So it's kind of agents, you know, okay, so basically there's a bunch of all these"
2373.0,2375.0, Here's a list of shit that people in this town
2375.4,2379.2200000000003," Hey, basically want done you could be the activation for doing any of these that you want, you know"
2379.3799999999997,2382.02," Do you find the like I mean, then there's actually it's kind of like you know the"
2383.06,2387.14," The devil's advocate for one thing is like if you have too many options, can that be a problem to?"
2387.8599999999997,2391.7, That's always the case you know in what the thing that a blivion did to handle that well
2392.1,2396.62, That's we all know was to give you was to delineate the primary missions
2396.62,2402.8999999999996, And to set those aside from the side so if you ever said I just want to go through here and see the story and have it fed to me
2403.3399999999997,2408.04, You just continue to click and activate those primary missions and I I'm thinking it's very much the same
2408.18,2412.6," Okay, so you see it's like a bunch of notes from what I believe you did right and that's that's what I'm thinking"
2412.6,2413.56," It's hard to know though, too"
2413.56,2418.92," I mean, there's it definitely feels like a game developed somewhere else and it was developed in Ukraine and"
2420.12,2424.2, So far it's a good thing to me and I think I'm almost more forgiving like I mean when I shoot someone
2424.56,2428.2799999999997, So far when you start at the game like pistol rounds to next that they you jack shit
2428.2799999999997,2432.96, They barely heard someone a lot of times and Amos scarce so I'm running around stabbing people
2432.96,2434.96, We have a different feet of different knife attacks and
2435.76,2438.52, It was hard for me to tell whether this is just a case of
2439.32,2443.92," I mean, I don't think it's a game where you actively level up you never there's no such thing as far as I know"
2443.92,2447.32, I could be wrong but you have a level in the way that you do in oblivion
2447.32,2449.32, So I'm thinking that
2449.32,2456.56, They continue to let you have access to new areas and it did just to be stronger by the weapons and items that you get that's my guess
2456.56,2458.4, But clearly something's going to happen because
2458.96,2463.6," Everything you do isn't gonna you're not gonna be that much about pussy, you know, but I did get like I got a couple"
2463.6,2467.6, Sawdoth shotguns from people that I killed and those work work work great and then
2468.16,2472.56, It's got that cool vibe where you wander off into some area and you're like I definitely could tell
2472.56,2476.08, I'm not supposed to be here like the game is a little too difficult from here
2476.08,2482.24, But maybe if I'm good or if I just play really conservatively I can kind of survive and fit myself into this environment
2482.3199999999997,2487.04, Where's that didn't really work in the blame because the whole world was scaled to your
2487.04,2491.44," Yeah, I never liked it about oblivion like I I kill a like a rat somewhere"
2491.44,2495.52, And then come back later that same area. I like and then it's a bear
2495.52,2498.88, I'm a little I'm a little I'm a little exactly a level awesome and all the rats are scared
2498.88,2504.0, She knows kid in a town so I think it's got that and it just definitely had that cool. I mean
2504.0,2506.8, There's something about that kind of game when it's not being
2507.76,2510.16, When you're not basically the chief of the chief
2510.48,2515.84, Spectator in a film or something I mean it really felt like whatever happens is going to be because I choose to go there and
2515.84,2519.92, Something could be happening elsewhere and so really just feel like the AI is that operating without you
2519.92,2523.92," Yeah, I mean you can go like I did the GTA stuff that I'm I've long been bored of sense"
2523.92,2528.64," You know, but like when it was fun when GTA 3 came out and like I I across this broken bridge"
2528.64,2533.12, And I couldn't even tell if I was supposed to be on the bridge which was just the red thing because it was fence off and I was like
2534.0,2538.32, And in any other shooter that the presence of that fence would indicate quit trying to go through there
2538.32,2542.0, Right because that's where we were drawn the lines of this and and it's really just a facade
2542.0,2546.16," There's nothing behind you. Yeah, but I actually found a way over the fence and sure enough"
2546.16,2551.3599999999997, I could roam around on the other side and it was just part of the world and I crossed over this big broken down bridge
2551.3599999999997,2557.12, But underneath it there was a camp of military guys not just regular wanders and stuff and for the hell of it
2557.12,2560.48, I had a grenade on me that I had stolen from a body and so I just threw it down on them
2561.7599999999998,2565.7599999999998, Blue them up and it roused all the rest and it was they kind of created the spontaneous adventure
2565.7599999999998,2570.16, All of a sudden all these military dudes chasing me and then I had to like run a mile to escape them and
2570.64,2573.04, All of a sudden they're rolling to the next town and you know
2573.04,2576.88, So it sounds pretty awesome. You just need this pretty cool. I mean it's definitely rough around the edges
2576.88,2578.88, But it looks it looks really good too
2579.2799999999997,2584.64, And this is the part that was gonna show off. I forget it was like originally it was supposed to show out for what DX8 was gonna do
2584.64,2589.6, Right and that was the thing it was like how this game is gonna date so much because it's so old
2589.6,2593.7599999999998, But they're gone and they're still doing passes like the some of the notes I got for the version
2593.7599999999998,2599.96, I have is that the interiors they'd done all their normal mapping passes and you know and another other
2600.12,2607.0, Passes inside but not on the good deal the outside and you could really tell the inside was just really gorgeous and the outside looked great as it was
2607.0,2609.0, But if they do go through and that
2609.0,2614.04, Successive passes normal mapping stuff. It's gonna look even better so it's definitely on my to watch list
2614.04,2616.04, I'm not not blowing smoke up your ass. I mean
2616.76,2621.7200000000003, It's gonna be a game. I'm positive people be able to complain about it all they want people to that with a believe in
2621.96,2626.92," But at the end of the day, I think if you want there's something that's not the same shit you've been playing over and over again"
2627.56,2630.76, And you've got an open mind you're probably getting it it's probably gonna be a really big
2630.76,2638.92," You know cult success it unless unless I'm wrong. Yeah, I just the billion bugs and well kept besides the bugs is one thing always it's a it's a minor point"
2639.32,2641.32, but
2641.32,2643.32, The dialogue is like broken like you know
2643.56,2648.36, The lost in translation stuff or is it actually um fortunately and I know I don't know what what's going on
2648.36,2650.36, But it's all in
2650.6800000000003,2652.6800000000003, It's not Russian what is it is in Ukrainian?
2654.12,2656.84," I guess yeah, so and and it's transatlantic"
2656.84,2663.4," Insub in in in English with text and that's fine. It reads. Okay, but it's but better that than the"
2663.96,2664.76, Like
2664.76,2670.92," Come on guys we must be strong and fight the enemy right? You don't get any of that kind of shit, you know, so that's good"
2670.92,2678.6000000000004," It's kind of interesting the subtitles. Yeah, I like it. Oh, I don't know if it's bad acting or not"
2679.4,2685.4," It sounds like pretty severe like old old grizzled dudes that just survived a Holocaust was so smart, you know"
2686.92,2688.92, So very nice
2689.7200000000003,2695.8," What else uh, I like I did a quite a big speech on that so I could pass over the other ones that have been playing it's have to say"
2696.44,2700.28, Pirates Vikings and Knights to is out to or steam
2701.0,2706.2000000000003, in it's a full total conversion source mod and as the name implies
2707.08,2711.8, One group of pirates one group of Vikings and one group of knights and they all do battle
2712.52,2716.6000000000004, Beat the shit out of one another. They see if they had pirates Vikings and ninjas and then
2717.8,2719.8," Okay, so we just"
2720.04,2721.88," You know, you know is that I"
2722.2000000000003,2724.52, had a bet with someone that when I brought this game up
2725.8,2730.6000000000004, Who was it gonna be Darren or was it gonna be Ryan that said the game needed more ninjas first?
2730.92,2736.36, Cherish like so but Ryan is sitting there smiling because actually it was Ryan who said it first because I
2736.36,2741.1600000000003, Slyff the other day and I mentioned I was playing it the very first thing that come out this dude's mouth was knees ninjas
2741.24,2743.24, He's right
2743.24,2748.7599999999998," You know winning and he's like okay, well, I don't feel like such a dark if you bring it up in the podcast and Darren says it"
2753.48,2755.48, I was betting on that you'd say it first
2755.96,2757.96, You love that
2757.96,2759.96, Because that's off
2759.96,2761.96, It didn't happen in a natural context
2762.68,2767.7999999999997," But anyway, this is a real game it doesn't exist just for the joke, but it's it's in our early like pre-beta"
2768.1200000000003,2774.1200000000003, But the thing is is the guys doing the the modeling and the mapping are really talented
2774.1200000000003,2778.84, I mean that everything it looks completely professional looks better in a great deal of other games and
2779.7200000000003,2785.8, And but more so it doesn't look like every other game on steam or on source using the source engine
2785.8,2791.2400000000002, It doesn't know we're a bunch of like hyper real concrete textures everywhere and I mean it it's very much like
2792.84,2796.6000000000004," Almost like a time split or five to it, but even better looking to that"
2796.92,2804.92, But unfortunately though there are only there's only one class available for each of the factions now and they're all like very like melee heavy
2804.92,2806.44, So it's so it's pirates
2806.44,2812.2799999999997," Viking and night yeah, and so it's like pirates are running around and they've got you know muskets naked through you know"
2812.52,2814.52, Powdercakes and they've got a
2815.16,2816.52, Saber or something
2816.8399999999997,2821.24," Vikings have got you know hatch it in a sword and they run around screaming and they all got special moves, you know"
2822.2,2824.7599999999998, They've all got some really cool voice voice
2824.7599999999998,2827.56, Not commands to like you can hit X5 or something it's like
2831.56,2834.2799999999997, Gotish the Vikings put their view begging sure
2834.9199999999996,2840.52, So it's fun to or like the pirates like like one of the one of the map modes might be like get the booty and hold it
2840.52,2845.3999999999996," It's basically a murder ball from the board just or odd ball from halo, you know"
2845.48,2849.8, It's booty and everyone's running around like with the commands like they've got the booty
2850.36,2852.36, Hit me my booty like something
2852.6800000000003,2854.6800000000003, Right there is all you need yeah
2855.64,2857.64," Shri, it's all about the booty"
2858.76,2862.12, So that's what I watch that's available now even though it'll continue to develop
2862.36,2867.0, They're adding new modes were like maybe you're all fighting some enormous dragon and you should you
2867.0,2871.1600000000003, Is each of the factions is trying to be the first to kill it but they can also hurt one another as they're
2871.96,2877.0, Is they're trying to kill the dragon and and all these other modes is it should be a lot of fun by time to stone strictly multiplayer
2877.3199999999997,2879.3199999999997," Yes, strictly multiplayer"
2879.3199999999997,2885.96, We got like two minutes left anyone else playing anything of import I'm kind of in my traveling so much I haven't had much of a chance
2885.96,2888.7599999999998," Yeah, I was gone over the break so didn't get to play much but like when I got back"
2890.2,2892.2, I kind of went into
2892.2,2893.48, My oh my god
2893.48,2897.7999999999997, Burning crusade is coming out to do a better finish some of the stuff I didn't finish because I'm never gonna play it again mode
2898.28,2899.8, So I went back to oblivion
2899.96,2902.44, I think you're mentioning stalker before but so I
2904.44,2906.92, Spanctions I deleted all my my oblivion
2907.6400000000003,2913.7200000000003, I'm in the cause I was running at room on my hard drive and I had told you like I had actually like beat the game and so far as it could beat it
2914.36,2916.2000000000003, Like the pain stuff and I was
2917.8,2924.28," With all the mods that come out there's always cool stuff to explore yeah, I know I should have like but it was like I spent so much time in that world"
2924.28,2929.96, I was like by the time I finished it and it was also like I had like there's only so much room my hard drive
2929.96,2931.96, And I'm a huge game
2933.96,2939.0800000000004," I'll talk about next week, but it's like I had to put like I know there's that's that's the part"
2939.0800000000004,2941.0, I don't want to excuse for that. So let's just pretend
2942.0400000000004,2946.0400000000004," Just pretend I had to get rid of those. Okay, but I put medieval to on there"
2949.88,2952.1200000000003, Last thing because everyone could play open arena
2952.52,2954.52, Looks like ass
2954.52,2959.48," It plays like heaven. Yeah, it's quite uh it's quite through basically an open source version of it"
2960.3599999999997,2963.96," And anyone can get it, but here's the rathing about it. It's like you'd be like well"
2964.2799999999997,2969.7999999999997, Why at this point would you be jonesing over a free version of quick three one quick three is practically free
2970.3599999999997,2972.3599999999997, But the thing is
2972.3599999999997,2978.8399999999997, Is that everyone that's playing quick three is like a savant at the game the kind that's gonna make it wish you would just weren't playing
2979.2400000000002,2981.7200000000003, Where you get to the point where you do nothing but sit there
2982.2000000000003,2985.1600000000003, Essentially jacking off with your your saw because you're like I
2985.56,2990.52," Can't do anything. I'm just gonna get blown up, but in this game you could be that champion you could be that"
2990.52,2994.76," Yeah, I mean actually I mean I think I'm really good at quick three. I was always really good at it"
2994.76,2996.52, But at the point now
2996.52,3000.76, There's so few people like if you go into a legit quay three arena server the people that are still left
3000.84,3002.84, They're not it's not even a matter of good or great
3003.2400000000002,3006.6800000000003, It's like they're like that so they're a fucking one with the game. There are quite a few
3006.68,3010.3599999999997," It's just pro level right, but so like you can go in there now if like a good amount of skill"
3010.3599999999997,3013.56, Just completely dominate and open arena. I still think we should do that developer death match thing
3014.12,3018.68," I don't want all in open arena. Yeah, I can I can throw down some challenge. Let me just do that"
3019.24,3021.72," Okay, I like to challenge anyone at shooters"
3023.0,3025.0, I'll play you all
3025.0,3027.0, We're gonna throw the gauntlet down
3027.7999999999997,3029.7999999999997," Yeah, so"
3029.7999999999997,3033.3199999999997, Is that about rapid for this about wrapping that we gotta tell you gotta get out of here time flies
3033.96,3037.96," It does so we will be joining you again next week, right?"
3037.96,3039.8, We're gonna make a point of staying regular
3040.36,3043.4," Because you're all about regularity. Yeah, so"
3043.56,3048.04," We're gonna know we're gonna make a point of keeping the podcast coming out a weekly basis now, right? Yes, we are"
3049.0,3051.0, We're gonna find a way
3051.0,3053.48, Dying down enough so we can actually maintain normal speed
3053.8,3059.4, So sick or not I guess the point we have to decide I mean because usually in the past we come to a point where if if one of our
3059.7200000000003,3063.1600000000003," Staff is not there that day. We're always inclined to say well, let's wait for the ideal"
3063.1600000000003,3065.7200000000003, Seven but I think we're now it's like better
3066.2000000000003,3071.48, To put out to be honest better to put out a sheet of your half ass podcast when we then to put out none at all
3071.48,3072.6800000000003," Amen, make a minute"
3072.6800000000003,3074.6800000000003, That he was first to half ass podcast
3074.92,3081.08, So remember kids half ass cast I like that and Pimp us go out on all the forums and tell if you look if you like us
3081.4,3082.6, And listen to us
3082.6,3086.44," Go spread to where give us a shot. Spread the gospel. Yeah, yeah, yeah on that note"
3086.6,3088.44, We out actually Jeff get better
3088.84,3093.08," Yeah, and basically Jeff will hopefully be back with this next week have some multiple soon"
3093.08,3097.7200000000003," So you can go and complain, you know in our forums say the podcast just wasn't the same without jump regreen"
3097.96,3099.96, I hope he gets better
3100.36,3107.4," That's true man. Let's say it and that's how I'll be saying it. Yeah, so bye gang, we're done bye bye. Oh, boy"
