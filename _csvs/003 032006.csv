0.0,7.6000000000000005, Hello and welcome once again to the CGW podcast.
7.6000000000000005,11.92," This is our third, so I think it's officially a trend that we're actually going to keep doing"
11.92,15.120000000000001, this for better words.
15.120000000000001,16.12, Here we are.
16.12,18.12, Hi.
18.12,23.400000000000002, With me are a few CGW editors and I'll let them introduce themselves.
23.400000000000002,25.0, Sean Elliott.
25.0,28.64, Daryngelized on Ryan Scott.
28.64,30.96," Jeff Green, editor and chief."
30.96,37.760000000000005," And we have our pal Scott on the engineering tip over here, set in the levels."
37.760000000000005,42.0," So if things are going wrong, if you can't hear, if you hear us wheezing or stuttering,"
42.0,43.96, that's Scott's fault.
43.96,49.2," Okay, so let's start off with something nice and easy."
49.2,50.96, And talk about what we're playing.
50.96,56.120000000000005, This is a regular feature that I think I'm going to call what we're playing.
56.120000000000005,57.120000000000005, Wow.
57.120000000000005,58.120000000000005, That sounds good.
58.12,59.12, Where would it guess where that's going?
59.12,60.12, That's just how I got this job.
60.12,62.519999999999996, It's that kind of creative genius.
62.519999999999996,67.36," So this week on what we're playing, we're going to start with Sean Elliott."
67.36,68.36, Okay.
68.36,69.36, Playing playing.
69.36,73.12," Quite a few things, but I think the game that people are most interested at least"
73.12,75.56, today is Elder Scrolls 4 of Bolivian.
75.56,76.56, I.
76.56,77.56," Oh, baby."
77.56,80.88," And for one, everyone, as I'm playing, everyone keeps saying what?"
80.88,82.28," You're playing that, why are you playing that?"
82.28,85.16, Because typically I'm the FES nut.
85.16,86.6, It's purely multiplayer games.
86.6,88.6," Most of the time, the other games are playing this week."
88.6,90.64," Battlefield 2, you're a force."
90.64,92.44," Number of source mods, oh, not."
92.44,97.08, But so here I am with this game with spells and potions and unicorns and all this stuff.
97.08,99.75999999999999," Yeah, that's not really your kind of thing, normally."
99.75999999999999,102.28," Very touchy, really for compared to what you used to."
102.28,104.16," I think, well, there's a few things there."
104.16,107.24, One of the misconceptions is that I only play a specific type of game.
107.24,111.52," One is darkly on there, for the, my, however many years I've been gaming."
111.52,114.4," I've been playing everything, but I gave up on RPGs for a while."
114.4,118.52000000000001, So you did use to play the Zelda and all the console RPGs.
118.52000000000001,119.52000000000001," Yeah, I used to play them all."
119.52000000000001,122.68," I mean, even the reiki from the good ones, the fantasy stars to the reiki,"
122.68,125.32000000000001," being stuff, you know, the super-highlights and all that stuff."
125.32000000000001,131.6," But anyway, what drew me back to this, aside from the graphics, which are much better"
131.6,133.52, looking than a number of shooters out there right now.
133.52,136.16, And that's the typically where you get the best graphics.
136.16,138.76," Is that it's, for one, it's an action game."
138.76,139.96, It's hard.
139.96,144.08," I mean, it's rather than like more when the last Elder Scrolls game,"
144.08,146.32000000000002, more di-rolling is determining all the combat.
146.32000000000002,147.32000000000002, Now it's Twitch-based.
147.32000000000002,151.96," It's based on the physics of the game world where if you're, you know, in combat with"
151.96,155.16000000000003," someone, you're hating, it's based on your sword actually connecting with theirs."
155.16000000000003,160.68," And so consequently, you're able to get a lot of the reflex-based and intuition-based"
160.68,162.68, game rewards for your gameplay there.
162.68,166.32000000000002," At the same time, I mean, that's going to scare off some of the people that like the lower"
166.32000000000002,167.56, key more thinking-man stuff.
167.56,168.8," That's what I was wondering, yeah."
168.8,172.56," But I think that's still there because you can, as you're playing it, you don't have"
172.56,173.8, to approach it the way I do.
173.8,178.20000000000002," I mean, you can go into it and instead of getting all of your parries right and you're"
178.20000000000002,183.20000000000002," rolling away from guys and coming back and encounter attacking, you can go at it with"
183.20000000000002,184.72," potions, prepared in advance."
184.72,188.12, You've worked out what the weaknesses of your enemies are.
188.12,191.48000000000002, You come in with a number of combos spells that are going to hit and or hurt.
191.48000000000002,195.92000000000002," So you prep, you set them up to be weak to just the spells that you're going to follow"
195.92000000000002,196.92000000000002, up with next.
196.92000000000002,199.56, You got the right kind of potions to fatigue them in this and that.
199.56,201.60000000000002, You can put all the work in that direction.
201.6,203.79999999999998," There's stats of muscle matter that some extent though, right?"
203.79999999999998,207.92," I mean, for pardon my ignorance here, but probably some kind of modifier I'm guessing."
207.92,210.24," Yeah, your stats totally matter."
210.24,214.28," I mean, how, I mean, your sword, whether or not your sword connects his based on the physics"
214.28,218.76," and the interaction of the geometry, but how much damage it does is based on your stats"
218.76,219.76, and whatnot.
219.76,220.76, And you get that through fighting.
220.76,221.76, You get that.
221.76,227.51999999999998, You can get it through money making and by basically stats for yourself.
227.51999999999998,230.64, How much of the game are you finding is quest-based?
230.67999999999998,234.83999999999997," That's what I remember from Maro and the dagger fall that I was pretty much just, you know,"
234.83999999999997,238.67999999999998," trying to solve one thing or another, trying to align myself with one faction or another,"
238.67999999999998,239.67999999999998, or whatever.
239.67999999999998,240.67999999999998, Right.
240.67999999999998,241.67999999999998, Yeah.
241.67999999999998,243.92, The majority of the game is pretty much quest-based.
243.92,247.2," There's your main quest and then there are a number of side quests, but I think they're"
247.2,250.0, a little more open-ended now.
250.0,253.6," So some of them, think of some of the more oblique examples."
253.6,257.64," Like if you join the Brotherhood, which is the Assassin's Guild, and you know, you get"
257.64,261.96, the invite that way by basically killing an innocent person and you wake up and you have
261.96,262.96, them approach you.
262.96,267.52, A lot of the missions that they'll give you are a lot more like a hitman game or like a thief
267.52,268.52, or something.
268.52,269.76, So the game plays to me.
269.76,273.91999999999996," So if you're doing an Assassin's Guild quest and it basically has to do with, you know,"
273.91999999999996,277.8," maybe loosening, there's a mounted Minitar head on the wall and loosening the screws on"
277.8,281.15999999999997, that so that it falls and looks like an accident and kills someone.
281.15999999999997,284.68, That's an entirely different sort of quest than going through a dungeon and fighting
284.68,285.68, a bunch of guys and.
285.68,286.68, Right.
286.72,291.32," Similarly, it is a number of quests you're dealing with."
291.32,293.2, There's a lot of variety to them.
293.2,298.2, And then there's a lot of stuff that's fun to do when you're not specifically questing.
298.2,301.04," If you're just roaming around through the woods and you're looking through four, you know,"
301.04,305.12," rare herbs and flowers and stuff, it's kind of like a game in and of itself because then,"
305.12,308.92," you know, as you find those, you can make some great new spells."
308.92,310.92, There's giving me this.
310.92,312.96000000000004, You're just hearing yourself talking.
312.96000000000004,315.96000000000004, If you heard us talking about a game where we are like roaming through the forest looking
316.0,317.79999999999995," for herbs, that's a new thing."
317.79999999999995,318.32, That's bad.
318.32,320.2, That's pretty true.
320.2,322.03999999999996, I'm going to craft my eighths.
322.03999999999996,326.03999999999996," Let me ask you, but essentially, I'm looking for the Nin route."
326.03999999999996,330.76," I can combine the, the button drop or a plus seven feet."
330.76,331.76, That's bad.
331.76,332.76, That's bad.
332.76,333.76," Actually, it's bad."
333.76,335.52, I'm going to work because you have an advantage to play.
335.52,337.15999999999997, You're probably still playing with just one character.
337.15999999999997,339.4, If you try to play in different ways with different characters yet.
339.4,340.4," No, that's how dark."
340.4,341.64," Yeah, I'm on this thing, man."
341.64,342.64, I've got two characters.
342.64,345.67999999999995," One, the level 11 now, which is pretty eye."
345.68,347.40000000000003, I'm considering the game's just coming out now.
347.40000000000003,350.12," Then the other, not to hide about a five or six."
350.12,351.76, I got that going on the office computer.
351.76,356.04," But yeah, and then even the way that I've played both of those is radically changed the"
356.04,357.04, game.
357.04,358.04," I mean, they're so different."
358.04,361.04," What I'm wondering about is like, when you play these two different characters, do"
361.04,364.96000000000004, interact with other NPCs and totally different ways and like the overarching stories just
364.96000000000004,367.76, totally flip when you play them.
367.76,371.6," I'm not sure about the, the main quest really doesn't based on the difference in your"
371.6,375.64000000000004," characters, but say, you know, one of them is a magic primarily magic user, so I'm"
375.64000000000004,377.48, emphasizing on the mage quest.
377.48,379.04, So it's different that way.
379.04,382.40000000000003," The difference, I think primarily is just in the way that you're actually playing the"
382.40000000000003,383.40000000000003, game.
383.40000000000003,384.40000000000003, Okay.
384.40000000000003,385.68, It's the way that you're fighting and whatnot.
385.68,388.16," So it's not like you have to kill the guy as an assassin, but you can protect"
388.16,389.8, him as a major warrior or something.
389.8,392.36, I haven't seen any flips like that.
392.36,397.40000000000003," But depending the regardless of your character, as you're doing any of those missions,"
397.40000000000003,401.12, you do have quite a bit of flexibility in terms of what you want to do.
401.12,405.56," Another example would be that you, you know, you're sneaking into this compound and people"
405.56,409.56," get to this for you spoiler alert, but they'll get to it pretty quickly in the game."
409.56,412.16, And you're supposed to steal some book.
412.16,416.24, And basically what happens is that you sneak in under the cover of the enemies that are
416.24,417.96, conducting some cult ceremony.
417.96,421.88," You can either just get in there as soon as you get in the door, go crazy and start killing"
421.88,422.88, them all.
422.88,427.88, You can go along up to the last minute at which they ask you to kill their human sacrifice
427.88,432.32, and then you can either go head with it and do it and then go along grab the book eventually.
432.32,436.32," And after they all disperse from the ceremony and leave, or you can get all dramatic in Indiana"
436.32,440.52, Jones and rip his ropes off him and stand up with him and fight your way out.
440.52,442.24, So there's all these different things that you can do.
442.24,443.24, Cool.
443.24,445.48, Could you basically just rampage through the world if you wanted?
445.48,447.44, Could you just kill all the NPCs?
447.44,448.88, Not that I would do something like that.
448.88,449.88, I'm just wondering.
449.88,451.15999999999997, There are feet there.
451.15999999999997,455.04, What they basically do is they'll prevent you from killing quest.
455.04,458.52000000000004, I mean the main mission story related NPCs.
458.52000000000004,460.92, So you can't basically ruin yourself that way.
460.92,462.12, Basically run out of saves.
462.12,465.76000000000005, But you can kill a number of them and then the consequences will be that you're not
465.76000000000005,467.0, you kill the all-commiss.
467.0,469.36, You're not going to be able to buy any ingredients from him again.
469.36,474.08000000000004, You're not going to be able to do a side mission since there are so many non-primary missions
474.08000000000004,476.36, far more than there are primary missions.
476.36,481.04, You can't get away with killing quite a few innocents and diversely affecting where
481.04,482.08000000000004, the game goes from there.
482.08000000000004,483.08000000000004, Cool.
483.08,488.08, One more question about this which I have and I'm sure a lot of listeners have.
488.08,491.0, Any thoughts on you're playing it on the PC?
491.0,495.15999999999997, Any thoughts about PC versus Xbox 360 for this title?
495.15999999999997,497.47999999999996, It always comes up the whole time you're playing it.
497.47999999999996,503.32, Especially any time I get a frame rate dip I start thinking of a less pimped rig at home.
503.32,504.91999999999996, I start thinking of the Xbox one.
504.91999999999996,510.08," But ultimately, where I'm at now I really like the hotkeys being able to switch between"
510.08,514.64, my weapons and spells really quickly in the central for my fighting style.
514.64,519.4399999999999, What I assume they're doing on the 360 is making it so that the D-pad is your hotkeys
519.4399999999999,523.76, and you can actually see that in the game because they only let you have eight rather than
523.76,524.76, ten.
524.76,529.88, I think that's a little sign that they're going for the middle line right there.
529.88,531.72, Have you guys seen it running on the 360?
531.72,535.0," Yeah, the only possible difference is that you can get chance to actually sit down and play"
535.0,537.4, it full into it too deep yet.
537.48,541.48," It's just dropped right, you know, Lord text resolutions, it's about it."
541.48,545.88," Yeah, the other thing too is it like the experience is so much more varied on PC."
545.88,549.3199999999999," Like Darren's playing on a 30 inch monitor, you know, 20,000."
549.3199999999999,552.3199999999999," Yeah, 25, 60 by 1600 is awesome."
552.3199999999999,553.9599999999999, And the frame rate is amazing on it too.
553.9599999999999,555.6," I mean, there's no, there's no."
555.6,557.1999999999999," Yeah, that's how we're all playing that game there."
557.1999999999999,559.16," Okay, I'll just take some company to wrap it in."
559.16,563.12," As if David says console guys came through and people from one up in EGM and they were like,"
563.12,564.92," oh, God, we got to play it on PC."
565.0,568.0," After they saw, you know, like even playing on my right here."
568.0,571.8399999999999, But the other thing to bring up too is on the PC side is we get the mods.
571.8399999999999,573.88, And Marwin had millions of them.
573.88,577.1999999999999," And whether it's something that's simple as like, hey, we get to fly, you know,"
577.1999999999999,581.04, could could see that mod in the first week or flying around the world or something like that.
581.04,585.92," You know, I mean, there's just going to be so many little ways to change the experience on the PC side"
585.92,588.4399999999999, that I think the console guys are going to miss out on.
588.4399999999999,591.88," So here at computer gaming world, we're saying play the PC version."
591.88,593.7199999999999, What a big surprise.
593.72,594.5600000000001, But we're not biased.
594.5600000000001,596.08," Surprise, but unless you're really poor."
596.08,597.8000000000001, You have an upgraded in a while.
597.8000000000001,603.1600000000001," I mean, be honest, then you might want to go for the performance and the graphics on the 360."
603.1600000000001,604.9200000000001," That is, if you're running old hardware."
604.9200000000001,607.72," Yeah, but you know, if you figure if they want to play any of the new games coming up, you know,"
607.72,611.08," any territory, quick wars or what to have here that probably get a one to get a new PC anyhow."
611.08,613.44," So spend another 5,000 bucks guys."
613.44,617.84," Who needs a $300 console when you could have a new $5,000 PC?"
617.84,620.12, But you don't use car or computer or tough call.
620.12,622.12, Don't forget to bring up the TV thing on that.
622.12,626.24," I mean, everyone says on the console, you know, I Xbox 360 is 400 bucks or something."
626.24,629.72," But then, you know, like I was playing Ghost Recon events, Warfighter and on a regular"
629.72,630.72, TV on a non-HD TV.
630.72,632.5600000000001, And it doesn't even look that good.
632.5600000000001,634.76, You can't even read the on screen instruction.
634.76,639.5600000000001," So when you look at the prices and your comparison shopping, like figure in a nice HD TV"
639.5600000000001,642.04, with your next gen console gaming price too.
642.04,643.04, I was totally going to bring that up.
643.04,647.84," I was actually, I'm really anticipating the, uh, a grah, Ghost Recon events Warfighter for"
647.84,651.8," the PC, but to get my fix in the main top of them playing it on the 360."
651.8,655.92," I play, I have two TVs on one's, uh, normal resolution non-wide screen."
655.92,657.3199999999999," It's not boring, I said."
657.3199999999999,658.56, You can't even read the menus.
658.56,660.56, Like the game's optimized for wide screen.
660.56,662.16, You can't view otherwise crazy.
662.16,663.56, But on those letterboxed.
663.56,664.56," Yeah, totally."
664.56,669.56," And then on the, on my, on my big honk in HD set, the game looks cool."
669.56,672.56," I mean, it's, it's basically, it's 360 so come."
672.56,674.04, That's basically what it is.
674.04,678.7199999999999," Of course, I got bigger beefs with AI and like, and I mean, like, and not just, not just"
678.7199999999999,680.88," to my own, to squad mates who run, it's like, oh, that's a bullet."
680.88,681.88, Let me try to catch it.
681.88,686.08," But, uh, but it's, it's more just like, as soon as you start the, you, every time you play"
686.08,688.08," the level, you know exactly where the guys are going to be."
688.08,692.24," It'll be interesting to see what's with the PC version that's coming out shortly here if,"
692.24,694.4, just how different some of the AI is whatnot.
694.4,698.08," Well, when I was talking to those guys early on, they said straight up that they were focusing"
698.08,702.64, a lot on AI for the PC version because we know how demanding we are with that stuff.
702.64,703.64," And, uh, that makes sense."
703.64,706.92," Because yeah, it was like, it's, you know, between us, we're calling it Mad Dogman Grough."
707.0,707.92, It's all in here.
707.92,712.28," If Mad Dogman Grough lays their like gun, I'm using it, coin, coin operated, I'm using"
712.28,713.28, it system.
713.28,715.8," Dude, American leisure basically, you know, you're going down the street and you look"
715.8,717.88," up, you're like, Balkan, you're up there and they're right."
717.88,718.88," Dude, it's going to come out."
718.88,719.88, Watch this.
719.88,722.52, And then you're going to fall over and into the horse trough and there you go.
722.52,723.52, Totally.
723.52,725.88," Ryan, you've been awfully quiet over here."
725.88,727.36, Are you playing anything these days?
727.36,731.24," Um, I'm kind of playing, get the magazine to the printer."
731.24,733.24, I'm like a crappiest guy ever.
733.24,734.9599999999999, What a stiff this guy is.
735.2800000000001,736.76, I'm playing anything like the outdoors.
736.76,738.76, I don't have time for ball of energy.
738.76,739.52, Ryan Scott.
739.52,741.0400000000001, Not soloing in Guild Wars anymore.
741.0400000000001,743.44," Oh, someone has to make the magazine."
743.44,744.44, Excuse us.
744.44,746.1600000000001, What was a little keyboard Elbs admitted or something?
746.1600000000001,747.1600000000001, Yeah.
747.1600000000001,748.1600000000001, We're all playing games.
748.1600000000001,749.1600000000001, You got to lighten up.
749.1600000000001,751.52," Well, I'm looking forward to a living in."
751.52,752.52, Yeah.
752.52,754.1600000000001, That's what we've been talking about.
754.1600000000001,755.1600000000001, Yeah.
755.1600000000001,757.88," Actually, we don't have copies for a movie yet, do we?"
757.88,761.12," Oh, no, that, that was my whole weekend, waiting for a, a living in a show of my"
761.12,762.12, doorstep.
762.12,763.12, That was nice.
763.12,766.84," But that's the if you're listening, send us some damn copies of your game."
766.84,769.6, He's actually we've been assured that copies are on the way.
769.6,770.6," Thank you, Pete."
770.6,771.6, More the better.
771.6,772.6," Pete, we love you."
772.6,773.88," Sorry, I cursed at you."
773.88,779.68, But I said you guys got the codes for Euroforce for Battlefield 2 and any of you.
779.68,780.68, I'm stalling that.
780.68,781.68, You know what?
781.68,784.68," I tried, but I'm telling you that EA downloader hates me."
784.68,785.88, I'm having so many projects.
785.88,787.2, It's crash my computer twice.
787.2,788.2," Yeah, I think it's a mess."
788.2,793.08," I actually, uh, one of my friends had to read download the downloader."
793.32,796.0, In order to have Euroforce show up.
796.0,796.76, It's steam.
796.76,797.76, It's not.
797.76,798.76," No, that's awesome."
798.76,803.24," Yeah, it's like, yeah, it's like steam and the launch air is steam, but worse."
803.24,807.6," Right now, but beyond that, the booster pack."
807.6,810.44," It's kind of tough to talk about because, you know, it's gone from real quick."
810.44,811.44, It's 99.
811.44,815.32," So it's kind of like, yeah, that's, if you're working adult, that's really not much."
815.32,818.6400000000001," But, um, what are they exactly adding to it?"
818.6400000000001,819.9200000000001," I mean, like, what's the full run out?"
819.9200000000001,822.6," I mean, is it like a lot, they're putting in there for 10 bucks?"
822.6,827.76," Basically, what you get are three maps with two versions of each, you know, zone to 16"
827.76,828.76, player and 32 player.
828.76,831.5600000000001, They build the 64 player size map.
831.5600000000001,836.0400000000001," You get some new vehicles, which for all tents and purposes are just different geometry"
836.0400000000001,837.44," and textures, you know, but the same."
837.44,838.44, Same attributes.
838.44,840.8000000000001, That's used to some new tanks and then some new guns.
840.8000000000001,842.8000000000001, The guns are different.
842.8000000000001,845.0400000000001, They definitely handled differently or whatnot.
845.0400000000001,847.9200000000001, Isn't that something they used to do?
847.9200000000001,850.6," They would do in a free patch, say it is."
850.6,854.8000000000001, It's something they're doing a free patch and then when you compare it to also the traditional
854.8000000000001,857.88," notion of an expansion pack, it's pretty meager."
857.88,863.08," I mean, there's no, you know, say, for example, the, the, a secret weapon to World War II expansion"
863.08,864.88," for Battlefield 42, which I really loved."
864.88,865.88," That was a, yeah, that was great."
865.88,866.88, That was a good extension.
866.88,870.88," Yeah, it introduced, you know, a mobile spawn points."
870.88,875.5600000000001," I mean, an objective base mode, which is the objective base mode, I think, would really"
875.5600000000001,876.5600000000001, be cool in Battlefield 2.
876.5600000000001,877.5600000000001, I was waiting for that.
877.5600000000001,880.0," But, so take a side all the complaints about it."
880.0,883.16," It doesn't, it's not this, it's not this and it's not that."
883.16,888.04, The three maps are a lot of fun and they're radically different in experience than the other
888.04,889.56, ones that they were already available.
889.56,893.44," I mean, in terms of, you know, you know, a lot of them are really armor base and you"
893.44,897.64, can have these tank battles where your team has got like a calm with like eight to 10 tanks
897.64,900.96, rolling together and there's nothing like that in Battlefield 2.
900.96,904.24," I mean, it's just, you'd have two tanks on your side as a max."
904.24,905.68, Most cases just one.
905.68,909.96," So it's, it's kind of a, it reminds me a lot of, you know, the tank, the North African campaign"
909.96,912.88, since in Battlefield 42 where you had just massive tank battles and stuff.
912.88,913.88, It's a lot of fun.
913.88,915.2," I'm enjoying it, get my money's worth."
915.2,920.48, I like it more than the special forces expansion pack so far for what's there.
920.48,923.6800000000001," Was there a big patch to go with it, too?"
923.6800000000001,924.6800000000001, There was it.
924.6800000000001,929.5600000000001," Yeah, they've been patching it like crazy recently and look forward to CGW about to go into"
929.5600000000001,931.72, this new month and our new viewpoint section.
931.72,932.72, Get him.
932.72,936.32, He's looking at the history of Battlefield 2 and how it's evolved and where it's at.
936.4000000000001,940.6400000000001," So basically with the last patch, it signifies a victory for one of the camps in the community"
940.6400000000001,945.6400000000001," where you've got these two factions that both expect different, each expects different things"
945.6400000000001,949.5600000000001, from how the game's supposed to play and basically one of them won the ones that wanted
949.5600000000001,953.84," really accurate weapons, they wanted their sick of air superiority and whatnot."
953.84,958.12," So they reversed all these things and it's interesting to see, you know, one group get their"
958.12,959.6800000000001, day and then the other deal with it now.
959.6800000000001,962.12, But so you can't please everybody.
962.12,963.12, You definitely can't.
963.12,964.12, You never can.
964.2,967.36," You know, I just just jumped them back on one thing though because I don't know."
967.36,972.88, I feel like I have to get props at least to epic and you'll be soft because they release
972.88,974.8, free expansion still.
974.8,980.24, I mean for Rainbow Six 3 and for Unreal 2004 we're still seeing mega packs all the time
980.24,984.36," come out or you know, a couple free maps and weapons and levels and whatnot."
984.36,986.88," Now, Phoebe Safka just loses Star Force though."
986.88,988.2," Well, they're working on it."
988.2,989.2, I hope.
989.2,991.0," An epic spin, just huge with them."
991.0,995.72," I mean, the size of the content you get, this just for an animal with their games."
995.72,1000.0, The other thing that's hard on Battlefield 2 is that you can complain about is that unlike
1000.0,1005.4," say, you know, a game based on an epic engine or valve source engine where users are creating"
1005.4,1007.16, tons of maps.
1007.16,1010.88," With Battlefield, users can, the assets are there and I mean, there are a number of good"
1010.88,1013.16, maps there but there's no way they distribute them.
1013.16,1017.04," Since they're not, they're not distributed on the EA download or you can't just join"
1017.04,1020.48, a server and have it auto load like you would with a Half Life 2 game.
1020.48,1024.48, So what happens is essentially these maps are there but there's no way no one will get
1024.48,1028.84, them because most people don't go Google searching new Battlefield 2 maps and then go through
1028.84,1030.04, the trouble of finding a server.
1030.04,1033.24, So I bet you got a locked in the buying their booster packs for new.
1033.24,1037.4," Well, I bet if you go to filefront.com, you could find all the or Battlefield 2 needs."
1037.4,1038.4, You could.
1038.4,1040.88, And then start making some servers to host a host man.
1040.88,1043.1200000000001, I am such a whore.
1043.1200000000001,1045.3600000000001," You are, but you're, we're, we're, we're cheap one."
1045.3600000000001,1046.3600000000001, That's right.
1046.7199999999998,1051.32," Ah, and how much time we have left to get into the, to the other topic for is that four"
1051.32,1052.32, minutes.
1052.32,1053.9599999999998," Wow, that's not a long time."
1053.9599999999998,1059.04," Oof, do we want to hold off on this other topic or so we mentioned it briefly?"
1059.04,1062.08," Let's just, let's just, let's try to tackle it and see what we can do."
1062.08,1063.08," Well, let's mention this briefly."
1063.08,1068.1599999999999," The other, the other topic is related to our opinions on games and it's the fact that the"
1068.1599999999999,1074.24," April issue just shipped with our, with our bold new direction, which is no stars on the"
1074.24,1075.24, ratings.
1075.24,1079.52, This was a conscious decision that we thought about a lot that were pretty serious about
1079.52,1087.2, and that were still pretty gung-ho on despite a small avalanche of mail and like I did last
1087.2,1088.2, week.
1088.2,1092.0, I'm going to read a letter because it's so fun to do.
1092.0,1093.8, Here we go.
1093.8,1095.8, Cloth.
1095.8,1101.1200000000001," I buy your magazine and PC gamer for one thing, the reviews."
1101.1200000000001,1103.76, I don't read the previous or the features.
1103.76,1104.76, That's great to hear.
1105.0,1109.52," I don't have a lot of spare time in my life, so reviews scores allow me to skip the"
1109.52,1114.08," trash and read only the reviews of good games, which then allows me to further whittle down"
1114.08,1117.0, the small number of games I have time to play.
1117.0,1122.24, Please refund my April issue as it is worthless to me without reviews scores.
1122.24,1127.36," If you plan to continue this in the future, cancel and refund the balance of my subscription."
1127.36,1130.0, Okay.
1130.0,1134.64, So he feels betrayed and so do a lot of other readers.
1134.64,1137.24, Be betrayed or disappointed or upset.
1137.24,1138.24, They want their score.
1138.24,1143.56," They want to still tell them that this game is, you know, I mean, our reviews still are"
1143.56,1144.56, reviews.
1144.56,1150.68," We still have opinions, but somehow a lot of readers are feeling their less useful without"
1150.68,1152.96, a number attached.
1152.96,1155.72, Because that would mean that I should have read the review.
1155.72,1156.72, God forbid.
1156.72,1157.72," Well, I think there's a lot more."
1157.72,1158.72," I mean, it's not like that."
1158.72,1164.16," And as a review said, it would take the past the duty to grind on the left hand side,"
1164.16,1165.16, even.
1165.16,1169.0," Well, with the April issue, it's kind of actually kind of misleading because we're"
1169.0,1173.64," building the no scores, being as sort of an April Fool's joke, but it's not really"
1173.64,1174.64, April Fool's joke.
1174.64,1175.64, We're going to keep doing it.
1175.64,1176.64, That was the joke.
1176.64,1178.64, That wasn't a joke.
1178.64,1179.64, Aren't weak leverage.
1179.64,1180.88, It's a thinker.
1180.88,1185.08, So you're going to start seeing a lot more changes with the May issue.
1185.08,1190.8799999999999, We're going to start doing sort of longer in-depth reviews on fewer games.
1190.8799999999999,1198.56, And what we're kind of trying to do is to encourage people to go to 1up.com to read
1198.56,1203.36, the score reviews on games and then come to CGW for a sort of bigger picture look at the
1203.36,1205.0, games they're covering there.
1205.0,1211.28," Also, you know, by saying that we want people to go to 1up.com, we're not saying we're"
1211.28,1212.28, passing the buck.
1212.28,1218.16, The fact is that the 1up.com review with a score is still our review.
1218.16,1219.16, It can be a lot of our writers.
1219.16,1222.6, It's going to be a lot of CGW writers and sometimes even us ourselves.
1222.6,1226.08, And we're just working really closely with them so that on day one when the game comes
1226.08,1229.12," out, you're going to see a timely review as opposed to waiting two or three months."
1229.12,1230.12, You want your score?
1230.12,1231.12, It'll be there for you.
1231.12,1232.12, Right.
1232.12,1236.92," Something else I'd point out to Rex, who wrote this, is that for someone like him who has"
1236.92,1240.36," so little time, this new system should work fine for him and that we're still giving"
1240.36,1245.4399999999998, editors choice awards when applicable.
1245.4399999999998,1251.08," So just by, if he's only got the time to read the very best game, it's in the play,"
1251.08,1252.08, the very best game.
1252.08,1255.9199999999998, That can be a guide right there in terms of us giving by.
1255.9199999999998,1260.6, We're still going to have those awards logos on the games that we really recommend.
1260.6,1264.52, I think basically a lot of people are complaining right now without knowing the whole picture.
1264.52,1266.8799999999999," Once they see the May issue, it's going to totally click with them and they're going"
1266.8799999999999,1267.8799999999999, to get it.
1268.0400000000002,1270.64," I mean, there's a lot more to it than just no score."
1270.64,1271.64, Right.
1271.64,1275.16," I mean, it's easy to latch on that because it's obviously a big deal."
1275.16,1280.5200000000002, But we are doing this in the context of a larger picture of how a monthly magazine can
1280.5200000000002,1285.64," work, you know, how, you know, if you're listening and you don't know this, we're basically"
1285.64,1290.88, writing these issues six to eight weeks before you see them.
1290.88,1297.0," So if we get a blivion today, for example, on March 19th, you're not going to be reading"
1297.08,1303.24," about it and reading our score until, you know, the June issue with this point."
1303.24,1304.24, Yeah.
1304.24,1310.12," And at this point with the internet, we have to ask ourselves what exactly is the point"
1310.12,1311.92, of doing that.
1311.92,1313.92, Amen.
1313.92,1321.32," And, you know, obviously we're not, we're not advocating the notion, you know, it's just"
1321.32,1328.56," that we have to think in terms of, okay, in by June, all the internet reviews are going"
1328.56,1329.56, to have been out.
1329.56,1334.56," You, the gamers have probably bought the game, played the game, and possibly even sold"
1334.56,1336.2, the game back already.
1336.2,1343.56, So we can't pretend that you've seen no opinions on it and don't have an opinion
1343.56,1344.96, yourself.
1344.96,1350.8799999999999," So the idea that we're trying to propagate with our may issue is, as Ryan said, is to"
1350.88,1356.68," sort of look take a big picture of it, that we're not going to just give you a review"
1356.68,1359.8400000000001, and pretend that this is in a vacuum.
1359.8400000000001,1363.92," We're trying to look at what is everybody saying about the game, what are the developers"
1363.92,1368.16," saying about the game that they've made, you know, in, as opposed more to them sort of"
1368.16,1373.68," way, what has happened to the game since it was released in terms of patches?"
1373.68,1375.0800000000002," I think that's the bottom only, too."
1375.0800000000002,1379.68," Instead of seeing it as you're getting less as, and you're not getting a score, really,"
1379.68,1382.76," you're getting so much more because you're not only getting our perspective, which"
1382.76,1386.44," will definitely still be there, but we're situating that perspective and the context"
1386.44,1391.2," of, you know, it's your saying Jeff, what the developers have to say after the fact,"
1391.2,1394.8," and not only what the other reviewers and, you know, review aggregate sites say, but what"
1394.8,1395.8, the community say.
1395.8,1396.8, Right.
1396.8,1399.2," So if it's a game like, you know, about to go back to that, since, you know, that's what's"
1399.2,1403.3200000000002," on my mind right now, you know, I'm able to look at all the key communities, you know,"
1403.3200000000002,1406.8400000000001," talk to people as I play with them, so ideally, you know, the reader, your voice is coming"
1406.84,1407.84, into play as well.
1407.84,1412.52," All right, we're hearing you and acknowledging that, you know, whatever we say about this,"
1412.52,1416.56," we can't get around the fact that, you know, that these things are there and that they're,"
1416.56,1418.48," you know, shaping the experience for people in different ways."
1418.48,1421.1999999999998," So I think that, you know, ideally, when you come away from this reading it, you're going"
1421.1999999999998,1427.28," to have a sense for just huge discussion that's still evolving around a game, and you'll,"
1427.28,1431.3999999999999," you'll have a much more well-developed perspective on it, and you're purchasing decision"
1431.3999999999999,1433.12, will be much better informed as well.
1433.12,1434.6," Well, or maybe we're just full of crap."
1435.52,1436.52, I don't know.
1436.52,1440.32," I mean, I, I, I talked to guys all the time and all walks of the industry and even like"
1440.32,1443.3999999999999," guys at competing magazines are saying that they're, they're wishing that they did the"
1443.3999999999999,1444.9599999999998, take the steps that we are.
1444.9599999999998,1445.9599999999998," So we're, I don't know."
1445.9599999999998,1446.9599999999998, We'll see.
1446.9599999999998,1449.9599999999998," We'll definitely see, you know, it's funny."
1449.9599999999998,1455.6799999999998," I had an email exchange with, with Johnny Wilson, who's some of you may know, as the,"
1455.6799999999998,1459.6399999999999," the former editor in chief of this magazine, way back in the day, he's the one who hired"
1459.6399999999999,1460.6399999999999, me.
1460.64,1468.96, And he was the editor in chief at the time in 1994 when C.G.W. added ratings in the old days
1468.96,1477.1200000000001," for, you know, the first, you know, in 1910, 12 years of this magazine, they were not scores"
1477.1200000000001,1478.4, on the reviews.
1478.4,1484.64," And after Zif Davis bought the magazine in around 94, they decided to add scores because"
1484.64,1487.2800000000002, that's what other competing publications were doing.
1487.28,1494.48," And there was a firestorm of, of a protest over regular mail and compia serve and other"
1494.48,1501.24," things back in, in those days because C.G.W. was perceived to selling out now for adding"
1501.24,1504.44, scores and for dumbing down the reviews by adding scores.
1504.44,1506.56, So now you didn't have to read it.
1506.56,1509.0, You could just look at that stupid number.
1509.0,1515.04, So now the initial email we're seeing back is that people want the scores.
1515.04,1521.6, So kind of an irony there in terms of what readers want or think they want.
1521.6,1526.2," Or possibly maybe the audience is just changing, you know?"
1526.2,1531.8799999999999," Maybe back then in 94, it was a different kind of crowd that could deal with out scores"
1531.8799999999999,1533.76, and now people need them.
1533.76,1535.32, Maybe it's just what people are used to.
1535.32,1538.08," Well, I think the critics are always the most vocal too."
1538.08,1541.8799999999999, Like I'm sure right now that PC gamers getting a still-brother getting low to mail about
1541.88,1545.8400000000001," their recent redesign in the same way that when I worked with Electronic Gaming Monthly,"
1545.8400000000001,1550.72," their redesign is a two years ago just brought in a deluge of just complaints, bitter"
1550.72,1555.16," angry, angry people and their forms, you know, same thing."
1555.16,1556.72, Maybe it's just that haters hate.
1556.72,1557.72, They're the old fates.
1557.72,1558.72, Exactly.
1558.72,1561.96, How are people writing when they're inspired because they're happy?
1561.96,1564.6000000000001," No, they just enjoy what they're reading."
1564.6000000000001,1569.2800000000002, Have you guys ever written a letter to the editor of any magazine like gaming or otherwise?
1569.2800000000002,1570.72, Usually when I'm angry.
1570.8,1571.72, Yeah.
1571.72,1572.72, No.
1572.72,1575.72, I always try to imagine what it takes to do that.
1575.72,1578.28, But what did Johnny say though?
1578.28,1579.28, His people?
1579.28,1581.6000000000001," Well, Johnny was laughing."
1581.6000000000001,1582.96, He was laughing at me.
1582.96,1584.6000000000001, It was basically that sort of Nelson.
1584.6000000000001,1585.6000000000001, Yeah.
1585.6000000000001,1587.04, Good luck with all that.
1587.04,1592.16," I mean, you know, and also interestingly, you know, he said that in a publication that"
1592.16,1598.3600000000001," he's working on, which I think is online, they are going to have a rating system because"
1598.36,1602.24, he just feels like it's kind of death to these days to not have one.
1602.24,1604.9599999999998," And he said, you know, thanks for proving my point."
1604.9599999999998,1609.4799999999998, So there you have it.
1609.4799999999998,1615.0," And we're getting a spinning finger from our, you know, same stop hammering."
1615.0,1616.9199999999998, The wrap it up box has been hit.
1616.9199999999998,1619.7199999999998, Do we have any final words?
1619.7199999999998,1621.9599999999998," Ryan, oh, Yoda won over there."
1621.9599999999998,1622.9599999999998, What?
1622.9599999999998,1623.9599999999998, The deadly silence.
1623.9599999999998,1624.9599999999998, I got nothing.
1624.9599999999998,1625.9599999999998, He's got nothing.
1626.04,1629.92, He's busy making the magazine folks.
1629.92,1632.76," If you like the, the May issues, I will work on it."
1632.76,1633.76, Yep.
1633.76,1634.76, You can get thank Ryan Scott.
1634.76,1636.32, Does he want to who wrote the whole thing up here?
1636.32,1637.32, Right.
1637.32,1639.32," Because we've all been playing sweet, sweet oblivion."
1639.32,1640.32, That's great.
1640.32,1643.04, We will see you again next week.
1643.04,1644.3600000000001, Thank you gentlemen.
1644.3600000000001,1648.52, And thank you for listening and we'll see you soon.
1648.52,1649.52, Bye.
1649.52,1650.52, Peace out.
