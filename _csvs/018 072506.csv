0.0,8.0, Hello and welcome once again to the C.G.W. Radio podcast. This is the podcast for July 25th.
8.0,17.0," 2006. We have a big show here today, but we're going to not talk for an hour like we did last time."
17.0,23.0," Because I'm too tired for that. But what we're going to talk about, our usual round of what you're playing."
23.0,31.0, We're going to look at the portal mod that's out for prey and then talk about portals a little bit.
31.0,35.0, Do they work? Why do they exist? Are they good for you?
35.0,37.0, Another such thing.
37.0,43.0," We're going to talk about the big news announced by Wow or Blizzard, I should say, about Wow."
43.0,49.0," The hard versus, I mean the Paladin, Shaman business that you probably all heard about."
49.0,57.0, Don't want to go into Darren's news and wrap it up with some happy questions from you people.
57.0,67.0," So with me today, are such editors as Brian Scott, Darren Gladstone, Shoneli and Sean Maloy."
67.0,75.0," Hi guys. So the, I think the question everybody wants to know is, is it hot enough for you?"
75.0,79.0, No. It's freaking hot.
79.0,85.0," It's hot here. We're in San Francisco and even in San Francisco. It's hot. I can't, I kind of can't take it."
85.0,93.0, I got up to 110 this past weekend. It's the same. I don't like it. It needs to stop. I'm tired and cranky.
93.0,97.0, Sean doesn't care. Sean Shoneli is a sitting over there.
97.0,98.0, He's a musicer.
98.0,100.0, That's a great way to start a podcast.
100.0,104.0, I'm going to step out and let our guest come in.
104.0,106.0, I don't know what I'm going to show.
106.0,114.0," Yeah, we do have a special guest joining a slate later on. Hopefully I'll ask him something more interesting than how's the weather."
114.0,120.0, So what are we playing? What did we play this week and the past week?
120.0,122.0," Ryan, you playing anything?"
122.0,124.0, I've continued to play even online.
124.0,125.0, Really?
125.0,127.0, It wasn't a one week passing fancy with you.
127.0,135.0," Well, by play, I mean, I've continued to keep my ship in a hanger, learning skills, well, I'm logged off."
135.0,136.0, That's true.
136.0,137.0, That's true.
137.0,138.0, That's true.
138.0,139.0, That's what I'm spending my week doing.
139.0,141.0, This is really a bit lazy question.
141.0,142.0, Have you actually logged on?
142.0,145.0," Well, I have had the log on to change what skills I'm learning."
145.0,147.0, But that's pretty much all I've done.
147.0,151.0," So as it goes to sit in the hanger and just kind of wait until you're leveled up enough so that you can actually go out and like it like,"
151.0,155.0," like, like, gank the first second you start like exploring the universe."
155.0,157.0," So far, that's kind of the impression I'm getting."
157.0,160.0, We'll see if that changes within the next week.
160.0,163.0, It's just going to be my character with French fries or something.
163.0,167.0," Like, buy a pre-made character from someone with French fries."
167.0,168.0, Whatever you got in your pocket.
168.0,169.0," Oh, okay."
169.0,170.0, What was some new day?
170.0,172.0, Can I have your eve character?
172.0,174.0," Was that, was that progress quest? Was that that game?"
174.0,175.0, Yeah.
175.0,177.0, Yeah. It was just all you dig was leveled.
177.0,179.0," That you put it on in the background and just,"
179.0,181.0," yeah, it went, well, you did your work."
181.0,183.0, This really is progress quest with a month later.
183.0,184.0, Yeah.
184.0,185.0, Sweet.
185.0,187.0," Well, someone's playing for it."
187.0,189.0, Daren.
189.0,195.0," Well, like, Sean's going to probably cover this as well, but I've been playing Chromehounds."
195.0,196.0," Yeah, for you 60 game."
196.0,197.0, I know.
197.0,198.0, I know.
198.0,199.0, It's sad.
199.0,200.0," Well, that's interesting."
200.0,202.0, Change the color of your Mac on your cell phone.
202.0,203.0, Exactly.
203.0,205.0, Can you really know?
205.0,206.0," No, it's coming."
206.0,207.0, You're all excited.
208.0,209.0, I got to get there.
209.0,211.0," Wow, I have anywhere is great."
211.0,213.0," I know, but it's, uh,"
213.0,214.0, I'm a fan of Mac.
214.0,215.0," I mean, I'm waiting for it."
215.0,218.0," Oh, I, I have a quick Mac argument."
218.0,219.0, Okay.
219.0,222.0," After Jack and say, especially after playing a recent build of Battlefield 2042,"
222.0,224.0, that Mac's are retarded.
224.0,226.0, They don't exist.
226.0,227.0, It's not Japan's 30 secret.
227.0,230.0, They don't exist because something far superior exists.
230.0,231.0, It's called a tank.
231.0,233.0, It handles terrain better.
233.0,234.0, It's faster.
234.0,235.0, It's more mobile.
235.0,236.0, It's a very good way to get it.
236.0,238.0, It's a terrain better when you've got like walking legs.
238.0,243.0, They get stuck on trees and then are slow to turn and then throw off your aim as you're moving.
243.0,245.0, The menu's got stabilizers and chrome.
245.0,246.0, I'm also here.
246.0,248.0," But it's still, it's so slow and dumb."
248.0,249.0, It's like in my mind.
249.0,251.0, I got to get it out there.
251.0,254.0, My usual complaint about Metal Gear is another game with mexin it.
254.0,255.0, Right.
255.0,259.0, The whole thing is we're building a mobile nuclear platform.
259.0,260.0," It has like, it's a mexin."
260.0,261.0," But it's like, hello, dude."
261.0,263.0, Have you heard of a submarine?
263.0,264.0, You could go anywhere you want.
264.0,265.0, It's fast as you want.
265.0,270.0, It's stealthily as you want and deliver it where you're on or on or a jet.
270.0,271.0, God forbid.
271.0,274.0," Well, that takes care of water and air."
274.0,275.0, Your mac is.
275.0,277.0," Yeah, because you can't because it's impossible to get it."
277.0,281.0, Get a missile launch from the water to hit land.
281.0,282.0, All right.
282.0,283.0, It's a go on.
283.0,285.0, But I was talking about chrome hounds.
285.0,287.0, It was a quick run.
287.0,288.0, It's a game that has some potential.
288.0,293.0," It's so freaking annoying for like, I had like one issue is."
293.0,294.0, Okay.
294.0,295.0, So it's literally the future.
295.0,297.0, You control these giant walk and robots.
297.0,298.0," But one, there's no infrared."
298.0,300.0, So you can't see in the dark.
300.0,303.36," And two, there's no like, wait or identify who your friends are and they all look as"
303.36,304.36, all look the same.
304.36,307.0, You're into shooting your own guys in the back half the time.
307.0,309.0, These guys have and studied like real mac.
309.0,310.0, Yeah.
310.0,311.0, And that's a real red.
311.0,312.0, That's that's weak.
312.0,313.0," But I mean, like even like, really strange."
313.0,314.0, It's a real good.
314.0,318.0," It seems like a like, conscious design decision on their part to kind of force"
318.0,322.0," you to, you know, not rely just on your hood or a flashing greener or your hood."
322.0,323.0, But they didn't play the infrared.
323.0,327.0, What about the environment's neck event?
327.0,329.0, They need to flash light mod.
329.0,334.0," Another hallmark of mech games is just these big 30 wastelands of uniform, brown texture."
334.0,335.0, And get a lot of light.
335.0,336.0, Yeah.
336.0,340.0, It's a thing about the single player game.
340.0,347.0," A lot of like the reviews are kind of just getting stuck on that because it's pretty, it's pretty much just a training session."
347.0,349.0, An extended training system for the online.
349.0,353.0," And I wasn't, I wasn't into it when I first started them like, I'm just shooting things and walking forward."
353.0,357.0," Then as I started playing each of the six roll types, which is essentially like six classes."
357.0,360.0, It almost turned into an MMO in a sort of way.
360.0,361.0, Okay.
361.0,362.0, That's what I was reading.
362.0,363.0, Right.
363.0,365.0," It's an, you basically, you form a clowns up and it seems really cool in that respect."
365.0,369.0," I know guys on quarter to three are all like, you know, form a clowns right now."
369.0,371.0, And can you do like leatherworking or anything like that?
371.0,374.0," No, it doesn't have the story."
374.0,375.0, Classies like.
375.0,377.0, I can't knit hats for my party at it.
377.0,380.0, So how is it like you name MMO then how many people are in the game?
380.0,381.0, I have no idea.
381.0,383.0, So it's like a MMO.
383.0,386.0, It's a massive party of five.
386.0,389.0," Yeah, maybe one of the M's is missing, but the,"
389.0,393.0," But I mean, that sounds like a class-based shooter."
393.0,396.0, What you described that's more of a class-based shooter than.
396.0,398.0, You guys got to quit throwing these terms right.
398.0,399.0, Confused people.
399.0,400.0, True.
400.0,402.0, But I don't have a layer with that.
402.0,403.0, Yeah.
403.0,404.0, Sorry.
404.0,405.0, I'm playing it though.
405.0,407.0," I don't know about you Sean, but I was, I kept thinking back,"
407.0,409.0," Like, why couldn't they make another Mcwarrior game?"
409.0,410.0, I really enjoy those back of the day.
410.0,412.0, That's who we when I get into was Mcwarrior.
412.0,414.0, I'm a really independent Mcwarrior too soon.
414.0,417.0, You're in the my computer couldn't handle it.
417.0,421.0," But then when they use the Mcwarrior to enter to make interstate 76,"
421.0,422.0, that I really liked.
422.0,423.0, Yeah.
423.0,424.0, But that was cars.
424.0,426.0, I can relate to cars better.
426.0,428.0, Will you just like the phone music probably better than next?
428.0,429.0, Then what?
429.0,430.0, Better than next?
430.0,432.0, And the cars better than the next.
432.0,433.0, Yeah.
434.0,437.0," I put a couple of mall top cocktails in the trunk of a car,"
437.0,442.0," Lopinto, and you've got a better, better weapon, better instrument of war."
442.0,444.0, Yeah.
444.0,445.0, All right.
445.0,447.0," Well, I think if we talk about this any longer, people are going to say,"
447.0,449.0, Why do you spend the whole podcast talking about it?
449.0,450.0, Yeah.
450.0,451.0, Let's talk about PC game.
451.0,452.0, Is it going to get ported?
452.0,453.0, Got it.
453.0,454.0, I don't think that's great.
454.0,455.0, We're not going to take it.
455.0,456.0, I don't think it cram hands again.
456.0,457.0, It's a summer.
457.0,460.0," I've been playing the ship and trying to get everyone in here to play,"
460.0,463.0, because it would be the perfect game for us to play on lunch breaks.
463.0,464.0," You know, quick jump in."
464.0,465.0, Quick jump in.
465.0,466.0, All of us can do it.
466.0,467.0, It doesn't.
467.0,469.0," So rule out people that aren't, you know,"
469.0,472.0, They don't have the quickest reaction times and the best which play.
472.0,475.0, I don't really know what it was until I read about it this morning.
475.0,476.0, And it's like it's.
476.0,478.0, This was using the Half-Life 2 engine.
478.0,479.0, Yeah.
479.0,481.0, So it's a mod for Half-Life 2.
481.0,482.0, But it's.
482.0,484.0, It's a mod for Half-Life 1.
484.0,485.0, Okay.
485.0,487.0, It existed in that context.
487.0,489.0, There's an interesting thing about that.
489.0,490.0, I'm going to say in a minute.
490.0,492.0," But um, and now it's a full, you know,"
492.0,493.0, It's a full blown game.
493.0,494.0," It's, you know, on steam,"
494.0,496.0, E-tail for 1999.
496.0,499.0," And it's like, because it was a mod at first,"
499.0,504.0, it's getting some negative response for people that were used to playing it in that free context.
504.0,509.0, Are still seeing it as a mod and they're expecting more because it isn't necessarily the most polished game.
509.0,514.0," And the charm for me is not in how well it's put together,"
514.0,517.0," but how cool the ideas are behind it and how I mean,"
517.0,520.0," and they do, it is executed, you know, well, I mean,"
520.0,522.0, it's definitely fun to play.
522.0,523.0," I'm not going to play it in, you know,"
523.0,526.0," four hour marathon sessions, like I do with battlefield or something like that,"
526.0,528.0," but you know, when I hop in for an hour or something,"
528.0,529.0," it's, it's good times."
529.0,534.0," So quick run down on it since some people listening won't even know what we're talking about is,"
534.0,537.0," you, it's an entirely multiplayer game."
537.0,540.0, And you've got each level is a different cruise ship.
540.0,543.0," And it's, when's it set somewhere between somewhere in the 40s,"
543.0,544.0, anything?
544.0,545.0," Yeah, 40s."
545.0,549.0, It takes place entirely on a ship on a cruise ship and every player than it is basically a person on the ship.
549.0,551.0," There are NPCs, but they're like, you know, bar tenders,"
551.0,554.0, people that run the break that run the infirmary and whatnot.
554.0,558.0, And each person is also assigned to kill another passenger.
558.0,560.0, And only they know who that is.
560.0,565.0," And it's never like a, a tit for tat where the person you're hunting is also hunting you."
565.0,567.0, They're hunting someone else and someone else is hunting you.
567.0,572.0," So you're trying to identify who your target is by walking around and inspecting them,"
572.0,575.0," looking at them, you know, they can change clothes and things like that."
575.0,577.0, And at the same time watching your own back.
577.0,581.0," So it gets really, because everyone's suspicious of one another."
581.0,585.0, You see people walking to a room and immediately everyone kind of wants to spread out or whatnot.
585.0,587.0," And less, unless it's fun."
587.0,590.0," Unless there's, you know, like a guard person there or something,"
590.0,592.0," and you can pay them, bribe them for a moment."
592.0,597.0," So someone, say if you're hunting someone and they're just going to go be chicken shit and go sit by the guard for the whole game."
597.0,599.0, You can go up and bribe him and then off them.
600.0,606.0," And then to add to the complexity and sort of the balance things out, you have these Sims like needs where you've got to, you know,"
606.0,611.0," relieve yourself, get to go to the bathroom, get a sleep, you've got to read, you've got to talk with people."
611.0,612.0, Really?
612.0,615.0," Yeah, and if you don't do these things, you get tired and then you slow down."
615.0,617.0," You have to stop for a minute, people can catch you."
617.0,620.0," But the fun part is, is that you start to bounce it out."
620.0,621.0," You're like, I have to take a leak."
621.0,623.0, But I think someone's chasing right now.
623.0,624.0, I'm not going to do it.
624.0,625.0, I'm going to wait.
625.0,628.0," And then it turns out you were just being, you know, paranoid and they weren't."
628.0,633.0," And then you go to take a leak and then immediately the door opens and there's an ax murder in front of you and off see when you're, you know, whatever."
633.0,636.0, That is just not a good way to go out.
636.0,637.0, It's not.
637.0,643.0, I've seen the best thing is someone was taking a dump and I poisoned them and so they start puking because that's one of the slower.
643.0,644.0, You get more.
644.0,646.0, It's based on a stats gaming.
646.0,647.0, It's based on this economy.
647.0,651.0, You get more money depending on the complexity of your kill.
651.0,653.0, So an ax kill nets you almost nothing.
653.0,657.0," It's an easy, you know, there are fire axes all over the ship."
657.0,665.0," And for, you know, with emergency equipment stuff, but when you get the more obscure stuff, you get someone with like needing needles or something and it takes a lot longer because they don't do as much damage."
665.0,667.0, And they can fight back to you.
667.0,670.0, They can safely fight back and kill you.
670.0,672.0," And then, you know, and that works in their advantage."
672.0,685.0," But the thing that keeps people from all just going home, side-on-murdering, everyone is that if it's not your target and it's not your hunter, you're fine and you're sent to the brig and after a certain number of just like bloodless kills, you're just evicted from the server."
685.0,688.0, So you have to focus on your target.
688.0,689.0, Right.
689.0,690.0, But you can trick people and it's fun.
690.0,697.0," Then you go into a room close the door behind you and push someone, which you can do and they start freaking out and then they pull out their weapon and then it kill you."
697.0,707.0," And you don't, you just respond then in that circumstance and then they get the loss and you basically just trick them into almost getting kicked from the game by being so afraid of what you're doing."
707.0,712.0, So a lot of the fun comes in that kind of scenario and that's why I want to solve it all the play.
712.0,722.0," So the next time like your wife or spouse or mom or whatever complaints with these games or writing your mind, you can point into this game where you can stab somebody who's while they're taking a jump."
722.0,723.0, Yeah.
723.0,725.0, Or you can make a cut out.
725.0,726.0, See?
726.0,727.0, Some games were sophisticated.
727.0,728.0," Hey, it's like Clube."
728.0,731.0," It is like, like, they're going to say it makes a clue."
731.0,733.0, This is in a first-person game.
733.0,734.0, Yeah.
734.0,735.0, It sounds really unique.
735.0,736.0, Yeah.
736.0,737.0, It is.
737.0,738.0, All right.
738.0,739.0," After this podcast, let's do it."
739.0,740.0, We'll do it.
740.0,741.0, And then the secret aligns is a fun too.
741.0,742.0, Yeah.
742.0,748.0," Because you can play like defensive linemen for someone after you've already killed your target and you just say, hey, I know if you're in team speak and other people don't know it."
748.0,750.0," Like, hey, you know, I found your quarries in this room."
750.0,754.0, I'm going to go block him in there and he's going to be afraid to kill me because I might not be the guy.
754.0,757.0, And then you just come by the door and shoot a flare gun in there and burn us all down.
757.0,758.0, It'll be fine.
758.0,759.0, You know?
759.0,761.0, So what do the Sims needs to this?
761.0,764.0, Do they just make it so that you can't just focus on the killing?
764.0,765.0, Right.
765.0,766.0, How does that figure into the back?
766.0,769.0, They make it so that you can't that everyone is not constantly just running the game.
769.0,772.0, They're constantly just running around killing one another.
772.0,775.0, That's the element of tension where you have to manage that stuff at the same time.
775.0,776.0, So it's not annoying.
776.0,777.0," I mean, it's not really."
777.0,779.0," It's kind of, it's kind of fun."
779.0,780.0, It adds tension for me.
780.0,785.0," It's like, I know like, I just keep putting off sleep and I'm like, okay, if I put it off a minute more, I'm not going to be able to sprint anymore."
785.0,786.0, And that's a bad thing.
786.0,787.0, And then I'm going to go to bed.
787.0,789.0, I'm going to have to sleep for a lot longer than taking a quick nap.
789.0,790.0, And I'm just going to be sitting there.
790.0,795.0," And if someone comes in and finds me, then you don't take them all and do everything."
795.0,797.0," So yeah, it's not so annoying."
797.0,801.0, There are quite a few different demands that you have to need that you have to satisfy.
801.0,802.0," And some, do they balance them all enough?"
802.0,806.0," I mean, I can't imagine like I want to run back to the bathroom every five minutes."
806.0,807.0," Yeah, you don't."
807.0,811.0," It's like, the ones like reading and entertainment stuff, those take a long time."
811.0,816.0," And it's not like you're going to, you know, you have to like read a book every two minutes or something like that or in game time."
816.0,817.0, Like every five seconds.
817.0,819.0, I'd be at bad messages to send to gamers.
819.0,820.0," Yeah, it would definitely would."
820.0,822.0, Reading is bad for anything's bad.
822.0,823.0, Yep.
824.0,827.0," Well, that, okay, so we recommended."
827.0,829.0, I definitely recommend it.
829.0,832.0," Yeah, if it's 1999 and if you've got something different."
832.0,834.0, They are very talking about that.
834.0,837.0," There are no, we're playing a lot of the games available on steam."
837.0,841.0, And it's pretty mixed because you've got only a very few that really stand out.
841.0,844.0," You know, in terms of the terms of the independent stuff."
844.0,847.0," So you've got Darwinia, which is the real stand out."
847.0,850.0," And now I like the ship, but like some of the other stuff."
851.0,853.0, They just put X 2 and X 3 on there.
853.0,854.0, Wow.
854.0,855.0, Wow.
855.0,856.0, Some finally getting around to playing X 3.
856.0,861.0, I recommend you guys check it out there because the one reason I hadn't played it before is because they had star force on the game.
861.0,866.0," So now that it's about over steam, you know, buy it off that no problem."
866.0,868.0, Cool.
868.0,869.0, Let's see.
869.0,874.0, So another big thing this week was the the controversial announcement from Blizzard.
874.0,878.0, It was also controversial in my office because I was.
879.0,882.0," Because I was supposed to break that story. So thanks a lot, Blizzard."
882.0,886.0, It appeared after you had flown down.
886.0,888.0," Yeah, offices met with him for a story."
888.0,890.0, Come back. We have the story laid out.
890.0,892.0," Yeah, open the internet one morning in."
892.0,893.0," Oh, look there it is."
893.0,894.0, Yeah.
894.0,895.0," Oh, look interesting news."
895.0,897.0, So I got to read one of the fun parts about France.
897.0,898.0, Journalism.
898.0,899.0, Yeah.
899.0,900.0, I'm going to.
900.0,904.0, Send Blizzard the bill for you having to rewrite that article.
904.0,906.0," Um, two bags of Cheetos."
906.0,907.0, Right.
907.0,909.0, But what do we think of that?
909.0,913.0," Actually, how many wow, we only have well, we have one and a half while players here."
913.0,915.0, Two and a half.
915.0,916.0, Two and a half.
916.0,917.0, Two and a half.
917.0,918.0, I'll be sure on John.
918.0,919.0, Yeah.
919.0,920.0, And I'm kind of the half play.
920.0,921.0, Right.
921.0,922.0, I'm going to have.
922.0,923.0, So okay.
923.0,925.0, So the big news is that.
925.0,927.0, In what a wild craft.
927.0,928.0, You have your two sides.
928.0,929.0, The alliance and the hoard.
929.0,934.0, The one thing separating the two sides so far in the two years that the game has been out is that they.
934.0,937.0, Each side had one class that the other didn't.
937.0,943.0," The, the alliance had the paladins and the hoard had the shaman."
943.0,951.0," And for the past two years, they've had Blizzard said to deal with the, you know, lining fans complaining about the imbalance of the."
951.0,952.0, The jaman or the paladin.
952.0,954.0, So they've had the nerf on both constantly.
954.0,956.0, And this was their way of.
956.0,959.0," In a way kind of throwing it a towel and saying, you know what, screw all of you."
959.0,960.0, You all get all of them.
960.0,961.0, Now shut up.
961.0,963.0," Or the, or the, or the paladin."
963.0,968.0, Or the two classes like lynch pins over their sides or that's the problem is that they're not.
968.0,969.0, They're not.
969.0,972.0, And I think because they were there was one.
972.0,974.0, I need side that the other couldn't have.
974.0,976.0, They couldn't make them lynch pins because there's dungeon.
976.0,977.0, You can't really tune.
977.0,978.0, Mm hmm.
978.0,981.0," To, you know, if you can't have a shaman and it's impossible to have a shaman."
981.0,982.0, Then we can't make you have a shaman.
982.0,983.0, So they're not lynch pins.
983.0,984.0, So that was the problem.
984.0,985.0, So they're filled with classes.
985.0,988.0," They could, yeah, they were at their very hybrid classes."
988.0,990.0, People are getting mad at over filled their classes.
990.0,994.0," Now if you call them filler classes, we're going to get like eight thousand letters."
994.0,996.0, I wish you so far.
996.0,998.0, I said calm that.
998.0,1004.0, I would argue pelicans are more useful than shaman's and groups in the end game.
1004.0,1007.0, But I like shaman's better.
1007.0,1008.0, So I think it's fine.
1008.0,1013.0," I mean, it's one of those things that you can't really tell what's going to happen till it's unleashed into thinking."
1013.0,1014.0," Well, that's a crazy thing."
1014.0,1015.0, And now it's did.
1015.0,1019.0," And then there were like, you know, eight thousand page threads on the blizzard forms."
1019.0,1021.0, About what a disaster this was.
1021.0,1022.0, It's like the government.
1022.0,1027.0," So everything taxis or, you know, yeah, everything that is announced is a disaster."
1027.0,1028.0, Of course.
1028.0,1031.0," And everyone's is an ever and half people are saying, oh, I'm never going to play this again."
1031.0,1033.0, No absolutely without even a boy cutting blizzard.
1033.0,1034.0, They're not just going to not play.
1034.0,1037.0," Why are they not going to play, you know, Diablo three when that comes at."
1037.0,1039.0, Because blizzard's jumped the shark.
1039.0,1041.0," Oh, this decision."
1041.0,1043.0, So I don't play.
1043.0,1048.0," It totally makes sense to me because anytime you do attempt an asymmetrical balance like that,"
1048.0,1051.0, it almost never works out exactly that way.
1051.0,1053.0, And it's happened in battlefield the same way.
1053.0,1054.0, Right.
1054.0,1055.0, But what's the big exception to that?
1055.0,1057.0," Ryan, this is a little gaming test."
1057.0,1058.0, Huh?
1058.0,1061.0, The chieptomy is a dark craft.
1061.0,1063.0, Blizzard achieved this.
1063.0,1067.0," They came up with the tragic and the three totally, you know, different sides."
1067.0,1070.0, So they proved themselves that they could do it.
1070.0,1073.0," And and even workcraft is, I mean, you know, workcraft two and three."
1073.0,1074.0, Yeah.
1074.0,1076.0, And then those are kind of different though.
1077.0,1079.0, Because you're constantly right.
1079.0,1080.0, Tuning all this stuff.
1080.0,1082.0, I frankly don't get it.
1082.0,1090.0," I mean, it's like if you don't want to be a shaman on the, on the, a lion's side because it doesn't fit in with your world view of,"
1090.0,1092.0, of Azeroth or something.
1092.0,1096.0," You know, then don't be one in the fact that you don't part of it."
1096.0,1101.0, So long as they explain it in the official story that I'll accept it.
1101.0,1102.0, Exactly.
1102.0,1103.0, What was your name again?
1103.0,1105.0, My name is Ralphie Myers.
1106.0,1107.0, Right.
1107.0,1109.0, These are special guests.
1109.0,1110.0, Special guest.
1110.0,1111.0," Special guest Ralphie Myers, check it in."
1111.0,1114.0," So you're okay with these changes, Ralphie."
1114.0,1120.0," Like I said, so long as Blizzard explains it in official continuity, then I can accept it,"
1120.0,1129.0," but if they simply drop these changes on us like this without it making sense within the context,"
1129.0,1130.0, and I'm gone.
1131.0,1135.0," Of course, you know, they are offering more explanations for their things."
1135.0,1138.0," And but people are saying like, oh, now they're just stretching it too much."
1138.0,1139.0, Right.
1139.0,1141.0, Because we're so believable beforehand.
1141.0,1143.0, It was based on a true story.
1143.0,1146.0, So I saw how it happened.
1146.0,1149.0," So how does, how does the horn, how do they have paladins on paladins,"
1149.0,1150.0, who are supposed to be made by?
1150.0,1151.0," Well, they're not actual."
1151.0,1154.0," They don't even call themselves paladins, but you can."
1154.0,1157.0," They call themselves, uh, and then the characters,"
1157.0,1159.0, they're just largely called paladins probably.
1159.0,1160.0," Well, they are."
1160.0,1166.0," But it's explained that like they, they channel the holy light for nefarious purposes."
1166.0,1167.0, Yeah.
1167.0,1170.0," And they call themselves blood knights, but of course, Blizzard didn't want you to call them that"
1170.0,1173.0, because then you would think you're getting a new class with your knocking.
1173.0,1174.0, Get out of all.
1174.0,1175.0," Yeah, because it's the exact same skill."
1175.0,1178.0," So yeah, I guess they captured some sort of like magic,"
1178.0,1181.0, happy light being and put it in the basement and they're sucking all the energy out of it.
1181.0,1182.0, Right.
1182.0,1184.0, So you're in the paladin.
1184.0,1185.0, Right.
1185.0,1187.0," And then the shame in, dr and I."
1187.0,1188.0, I forget.
1188.0,1190.0, That just makes sense of it.
1190.0,1191.0, And then the next one.
1191.0,1192.0, Who cares?
1192.0,1195.0, Now it's like you get one more class to choose from.
1195.0,1199.0," Yeah, it'll it'll change up the group dynamics because it can actually have a paladin and"
1199.0,1200.0, and the shaman.
1200.0,1201.0, Right.
1201.0,1202.0," And that might, hey, make some different gameplay."
1202.0,1203.0, Right.
1203.0,1205.0, It makes me mad to have more choices.
1205.0,1207.0," Now I haven't checked the boards, but with, with, with, with,"
1207.0,1209.0," with there are any complaints about like them saying, like, why didn't just come up with another,"
1209.0,1211.0," another, another class for each side?"
1211.0,1212.0, Totally different.
1212.0,1213.0, Yes.
1213.0,1214.0, Or why don't you finally balance the paladins and the shame in.
1214.0,1215.0, Like this one?
1215.0,1216.0, Yeah.
1216.0,1218.0, Why don't you finally balance this in a moment?
1218.0,1219.0," Oh, there."
1219.0,1220.0, Yeah.
1220.0,1221.0, That's easy.
1221.0,1222.0, Yeah.
1222.0,1223.0, That's simple.
1223.0,1224.0, I'll suck.
1224.0,1225.0, Why didn't they take it that?
1225.0,1226.0, Gamers suck.
1226.0,1227.0, I'll get it.
1227.0,1228.0, Heard it here first.
1228.0,1230.0," She, GW says."
1230.0,1231.0, Thumbs up.
1231.0,1235.0," So what are your personal takes on it as, as serious wild players?"
1235.0,1236.0, How much is it mattered to you?
1236.0,1237.0, It's not at all.
1237.0,1238.0, Not at all.
1238.0,1239.0," I don't, I think it's kind of cool."
1239.0,1242.0," Like, I might roll up a blood elf paladin."
1242.0,1243.0, Yeah.
1243.0,1244.0, There you go.
1244.0,1246.0, And siphon all your gold over to him.
1246.0,1252.0," I mean, I didn't invest, you know, nine million years in my life in a paladin or a shaman."
1252.0,1257.0," And maybe I would feel a little more affronted if, if I could have known that, oh, man,"
1257.0,1261.0," I've played a shaman and I really wanted to play a lion's, but I had to be heard."
1261.0,1262.0," And then, not other changing it."
1262.0,1265.0," Maybe I would feel a little offended, but it wouldn't end my world."
1265.0,1267.0, And I wouldn't post anything on a board.
1267.0,1272.0," So for these guys, it's like the equivalent of like buying, like, say, if you bought some,"
1272.0,1276.0," like, let the graph and it was said, you know, limited to 500 prints."
1276.0,1281.0," And then a couple years later, day and it up making like 10,000 more or something, right?"
1281.0,1282.0, Yeah.
1282.0,1283.0, Something like that.
1283.0,1287.0," I mean, just because you're like, okay, well, I didn't want to play on this side, but I did just so I could be this, you know,"
1287.0,1288.0, right.
1288.0,1289.0, So I could be a paladin.
1289.0,1293.0," And now all of a sudden, these other guys, they got to play the better class."
1293.0,1297.0," Get to, yeah, these pal, you know, the lines of paladins are up and arms because"
1297.0,1301.0," their special classes now, you know, available to the other side."
1301.0,1302.0, That's pretty sad though.
1302.0,1305.0," Yeah, but the other side's special classes available to them."
1305.0,1309.0," All right, but, you know, when you're a paladin, you don't care about that."
1309.0,1313.0," But it's like, what is it? I mean, is it like jealousy or like, I mean, what's the exact, like,"
1313.0,1314.0, words for it?
1314.0,1316.0," But for us, never mind."
1316.0,1317.0, I don't know.
1317.0,1321.0," For a video game, we're trying to rationalize with people on the wild message boards or talking about,"
1321.0,1324.0," wow, talk about the unachievable."
1324.0,1325.0, Yeah.
1325.0,1326.0, Not that we hold them in the stain.
1326.0,1327.0," No, we love them."
1327.0,1328.0, We love them.
1328.0,1334.0, We understand the passwords that probably you want to move on because Blizzard's doing it and you can't
1334.0,1335.0, do anything about it.
1335.0,1336.0, Yeah.
1336.0,1337.0, It's a shout out.
1337.0,1338.0, Harder the people to do it.
1338.0,1340.0, It's a serious thing to do in protest.
1340.0,1341.0, They could.
1341.0,1342.0, They could.
1342.0,1343.0, Bring your service to their knees.
1343.0,1344.0, They've worked with the warrior one.
1344.0,1346.0, They did that with the warriors.
1346.0,1347.0, Yeah.
1347.0,1348.0, I don't remember for work though.
1348.0,1349.0, Could they change anything?
1349.0,1350.0, I thought they did.
1350.0,1352.0, I thought that the mass protest worked.
1352.0,1353.0, There you go.
1353.0,1357.0," So what you got to do is I get every paladin on your server to go, you know,"
1357.0,1361.0, hang out and iron forage and jump around and start casting the crustiest spell.
1361.0,1362.0," Well, it wasn't there."
1362.0,1365.0, That's a little bit of a storm.
1365.0,1367.0, That that'll learn them.
1367.0,1368.0, All right.
1368.0,1370.0, That's enough of that.
1370.0,1375.0," Sean, yesterday I saw you playing around with the prey portal mod trying to."
1375.0,1376.0, Yeah.
1376.0,1378.0, Didn't see my coach working too well.
1378.0,1379.0, I don't know what the deal was.
1379.0,1386.0," Basically what this is is, you know, portal is coming out for coming out on steam along with half life episode two."
1386.0,1397.0, And so someone whipped up something and prey a quicky mod that's essentially the same thing where you have your wrench and then by hitting all fire you create an exit portal and then hitting it again.
1397.0,1400.0, You create an entrance and entry portal.
1400.0,1406.0," And then you can just sort of pretty much the same as the portal game, you know, go go through one into another."
1406.0,1411.0," And I went in and right away I was like, okay, I have to start a new game in the bar sex."
1411.0,1413.0, It wasn't working when I loaded up existing same side of it.
1413.0,1415.0," You know, starts on fresh."
1415.0,1424.0," I was like, I'm going to create an infinite loop and get these two jibronies in the bar and stuck falling through the ground and then falling out through the roof and then back back and forth."
1424.0,1426.0, But it didn't seem to work on NPCs.
1426.0,1428.0, They weren't going through the portal.
1428.0,1433.0," And I guess that makes sense because in that game, only really you can go through the portals."
1433.0,1434.0, Even though I don't know.
1434.0,1435.0," I mean, I don't mean, I don't mean to."
1435.0,1438.0, It's a two red next at the bottom.
1438.0,1439.0, They don't usually follow you through.
1439.0,1443.0," But you can't those are, those are, I wonder if in the code those are different portals because they make."
1443.0,1447.0," They, they spawn in and that could be a trick like or you're just to get them into the level."
1447.0,1448.0, Yeah.
1448.0,1449.0, You can't go back through those.
1449.0,1450.0, They just disappear.
1450.0,1455.0," Do the enemies ever, they never follow you out of a, in or out of a, they never can't remember."
1455.0,1458.0," I play, but they would shoot through them."
1458.0,1459.0, They shot through them.
1459.0,1460.0, Yeah.
1460.0,1462.0, I've never had one come in behind me though.
1462.0,1468.0, So the main problem I was having was just technical is that I was supposed to be able to press the button once and create an exit and then press it again.
1468.0,1473.0," What was happening is no matter how quickly or how, you know, long I had button held down."
1473.0,1476.0, It would create two in the same spot.
1476.0,1477.0, Mm-hmm.
1477.0,1478.0, And I just really couldn't work around that.
1478.0,1480.0," The other thing, it could be a fun edition of the game."
1480.0,1484.0," I think I suspect it would lead to quite a few crash scenarios where you're breaking it,"
1484.0,1486.0," where you're able to get yourself in places that, you know,"
1486.0,1488.0," Yeah, yeah, you're not intended to and things like that."
1488.0,1489.0, Right.
1489.0,1490.0, But it could be fun.
1490.0,1492.0," I mean, theoretically it could be fun for another playthrough."
1492.0,1493.0, Just messing around.
1493.0,1494.0, See what you can do.
1494.0,1496.0," Ralphie, did you try it out?"
1497.0,1499.0," The Ralphie, Ralphie, are you still here?"
1499.0,1503.0," Lied in, trying that one because I don't like that game."
1503.0,1504.0," Oh, no."
1504.0,1505.0, Why not?
1505.0,1506.0, Everybody's playing pray.
1506.0,1513.0," I would rather play a game that takes imagination in, like, an adventure game."
1513.0,1517.0, I thought you were more of a shooter fan at that.
1517.0,1518.0, I don't like those anymore.
1518.0,1520.0," Oh, no, what happened?"
1522.0,1524.0, Did you get traumatized online or?
1525.0,1534.0," Well, a lot of times I play online games to be friends with people and they end up making fun of me."
1534.0,1540.0," But one of all, when a, if I'll play their right game, I'll find some of my better friends."
1540.0,1547.0," But usually in the shooters, they ask me why I am, if I've ever been with a lady."
1547.0,1552.0," And when I tell them, I go to land parties and on y'all who personal to meet them."
1552.0,1556.0, And they don't seem to think that's irrespectable.
1562.0,1563.0, We're sorry.
1563.0,1565.0, That's a very useful.
1565.0,1566.0, I didn't read the last one.
1566.0,1569.0," You have friends here though, at CDW Radio."
1569.0,1574.0," Yeah, I've only been in this podcasting studio for five minutes."
1574.0,1577.0, And I feel like you're my better friends.
1577.0,1579.0, Yeah.
1579.0,1580.0, Okay.
1580.0,1583.0, That's what you're doing when you tell us about the news.
1583.0,1585.0," Yeah, sure, buddy."
1585.0,1587.0, Let's go on to the news.
1587.0,1588.0, Brow for you can stay though.
1588.0,1590.0," Stick around, man."
1590.0,1592.0, All right.
1592.0,1595.0," What, what happened this weekend gaming, Daryne?"
1595.0,1600.0," This weekend gaming, some rumors came out about what is going to take to play crisis."
1600.0,1603.0, And big be ready to buy a new computer console.
1603.0,1606.0," Yeah, I doubt, these are totally unconfirmed."
1606.0,1610.0," And guys, over D.A. said that these are just speculation."
1610.0,1614.0, So take these with a grain of salt or whatever.
1614.0,1621.0," So the min spec, if they have at least an F on 64 3000 or an Intel 2.8 GHz CPU."
1621.0,1623.0, And about a gig of RAM.
1623.0,1628.0," And in a video, 6600 or X800 GTO graphics card."
1628.0,1632.0," But what it's going to, if you actually want the game to look for quayers."
1632.0,1635.0," But that's, if you wanted to actually run."
1635.0,1639.0," If you had a few other things on your computer, dual core CPU,"
1639.0,1645.0," 7800 GTX, at least a gig at least a gig at around probably more like two."
1645.0,1648.0, And don't forget that six gig by hard drive space.
1648.0,1651.0," So basically, six gigs."
1651.0,1654.0," Yeah, like how there's an internet requirement here."
1654.0,1656.0," Oh, come on now."
1656.0,1658.0, That's too much.
1658.0,1660.0," Five, five, well, K plus."
1660.0,1662.0," OK, and I was OK with that."
1662.0,1666.0," And for all our readers who complain about having to get DVDs,"
1666.0,1668.0, you're going to need a DVD wrong.
1668.0,1670.0," Yeah, you're good."
1670.0,1675.0," So yeah, you just told you, well, the more basically fanning flames of rumour."
1675.0,1676.0, Basically.
1676.0,1681.0," But at the same time, it's like the equivalent of when Doom 3 came out."
1681.0,1684.0," And this is, you know, primed for DirectX 10."
1684.0,1688.0," This is really the equivalent, even though we don't necessarily have, you know,"
1688.0,1690.0, the exact equivalent of console generations.
1690.0,1692.0, This is next gen PC gaming.
1692.0,1693.0, It is.
1693.0,1697.0," It definitely makes sense that, you know, when you're going to, and you look at the game and you play it,"
1697.0,1700.0, it definitely lives up to at least my expectations.
1700.0,1702.0," At some point, you've got a pony up."
1702.0,1704.0," Right. And at some point, you're going to have to upgrade."
1704.0,1705.0, It's going to be time.
1705.0,1708.0," So basically, if you're thinking about it in computer now, either get a really cheapy"
1708.0,1712.0, to get you through till next year or just save up your cash right now and get something.
1712.0,1716.0," That's like, wait, I'm waiting for the DirectX 10 to see what's going on."
1716.0,1718.0," Exactly for this to this point, though."
1718.0,1723.0, The one thing that surprises me on their recommended specs is the dual core CPU because I've heard
1723.0,1725.0, nothing but bad things about that.
1725.0,1726.0, About dual cores.
1726.0,1731.0," When my friends has had nothing with trouble with it with existing games,"
1731.0,1734.0," battlefield, it introduces all sorts of crashes and stuff."
1734.0,1738.0," Whatever else he's doing on the computer, it's just always, he's always on one form"
1738.0,1743.0, or another with other people that have the exact same problem with the exact same setups.
1743.0,1745.0, I think that's the current problem with the current gen games.
1745.0,1747.0, I think that's really taking advantage of it.
1747.0,1752.0, I think part of it is seeing these next gen games and the next gen OS taking advantage of
1752.0,1753.0, dual core processing.
1753.0,1755.0, So you think it's going to become standardized then?
1755.0,1757.0," Well, I think it's going in that direction."
1757.0,1758.0, Yeah.
1758.0,1759.0, I would agree.
1759.0,1761.0, But the burn is to be too soon.
1761.0,1762.0, That's exactly it.
1762.0,1766.0," So I mean, like, basically, I know, I've gotten a couple emails from"
1766.0,1769.0, meters after running our new issue with the how to build your own budget PC.
1769.0,1771.0, You've future proof yourself right out of the present.
1771.0,1772.0, Exactly.
1773.0,1776.0," Well, no, that really is the problem is, like, if you, if you can hang in there,"
1776.0,1780.0," hang in there and, you know, buy another graphics card by some more RAM,"
1780.0,1782.0," do what you got to do, but you're probably going to need to, like,"
1782.0,1785.0, think ahead for DX10 and Vista.
1785.0,1788.0," And so far, it looks like this game is actually going to be worth it."
1788.0,1789.0, Totally.
1789.0,1791.0, And we're not saying that just because they paid us to say that.
1791.0,1795.0," Don't even, don't even, don't even joke because there's going to be someone out there"
1795.0,1797.0," that's going to be like, I knew it."
1797.0,1798.0, I knew it.
1798.0,1799.0, I knew it.
1800.0,1803.0," What else is in this week's news, Darren?"
1803.0,1808.0," All right, speaking of Vista or actually Microsoft in general, coming"
1808.0,1809.0, to zoom.
1809.0,1812.0," Okay, so there's been a lot of speculation about a portable hand, and a portable"
1812.0,1814.0, Game Boy like device coming from Microsoft.
1814.0,1817.0, And they've been slowly revealing information about it.
1817.0,1821.0, It's spelled ZU any pronounced zoom.
1821.0,1823.0, And it's a multimedia device.
1823.0,1826.0, What they're all they're saying right now is an only one entertainment device.
1827.0,1828.0, It matches that are on the web.
1828.0,1832.0, Make it look more like an iPod killer as opposed to a gaming device.
1832.0,1835.0, But there's speculation that it's going to be a separate gaming device as well.
1835.0,1837.0, It basically has a platform.
1837.0,1839.0, Thank God something like this finally came along.
1839.0,1841.0," Yeah, because we really, really need another handheld to play games on."
1841.0,1843.0, Because the engage worked so well.
1843.0,1847.0, But the only reason I'm bringing it up now is there could be some kind of
1847.0,1849.0, potential crossover with live anywhere.
1849.0,1852.0," The one thing to read in that is like, if it is a media,"
1852.0,1855.0, I think it's a good thing because I'm pretty sick of my iPod.
1855.0,1857.0, But it's like the only thing because I was looking at getting something else.
1857.0,1860.0," So it's looking at creative, but it's like I like iTunes."
1860.0,1865.0," So it's like if they, if Microsoft had a hub that big and had that much to offer."
1865.0,1869.0, But you didn't have to worry about all the other garbage about how if it's on you on there.
1869.0,1874.0," You can't, I can't, you know, transfer load it to my PC at work and stuff like that."
1874.0,1875.0," I would, I would be into that."
1875.0,1878.0, And then if it starts working with live anywhere and all that other.
1878.0,1879.0, Exactly.
1879.0,1882.0, I guess really think it has a chance against the iPod and iTunes.
1882.0,1884.0," Well, it's, well, it's beyond us with you."
1884.0,1887.0," I mean, like, I don't use the iPod because I don't like the, I don't like a"
1887.0,1889.0, list of the challenges talking about.
1889.0,1892.0," I like, well, I like the fact that the creative is in, for example,"
1892.0,1895.0," they let you lift like any, any audio or video on the video,"
1895.0,1899.0," uh, Zen players, you can any video format you can watch."
1899.0,1902.0," Like I can just drag and drop it, it'll convert the file over no problem."
1902.0,1904.0," You don't, it isn't that's cut and dry for iPod."
1904.0,1907.0," At this whole entertainment, all in one thing though."
1907.0,1910.0," It's like they're never, they're never any good."
1910.0,1911.0, Right.
1911.0,1912.0, Yeah.
1912.0,1913.0, Yeah.
1913.0,1915.0, Yeah.
1915.0,1916.0, Yeah.
1916.0,1917.0, That's part of the rock.
1917.0,1920.0," You come up with this one that is actually finally, there's all in one device."
1920.0,1921.0," Like I can finally get rid of, you know, the nine things I would want to carry around all the time."
1921.0,1922.0," Oh, yeah."
1922.0,1923.0," But, or what if it's not an all in one device?"
1923.0,1926.0," What I'm saying is like, what if it's like they have like the iPod flavored unit?"
1926.0,1932.0," And then they have a, a gaming, a gaming center unit that also happens to play MP3s and videos."
1932.0,1934.0, It all depends on like how they roll it out.
1934.0,1937.0, But what I see right now is kind of like a starting point.
1937.0,1938.0, Mm-hmm.
1938.0,1939.0, I don't know.
1939.0,1943.0," Because like if you got, if you have like a game device, there are certain control elements and things like that."
1943.0,1944.0, Yeah.
1944.0,1945.0, Yeah.
1945.0,1946.0, Just need to be on it.
1946.0,1947.0, Exactly.
1947.0,1951.0," And suddenly you have something that's a lot more cumbersome as like, you know, an iPod is really sleek as you get to get this little control wheel."
1951.0,1952.0, Yeah.
1952.0,1953.0, And nothing else cluttering it up.
1953.0,1955.0," It's really, really simple."
1955.0,1956.0, Yeah.
1956.0,1957.0, Really small.
1957.0,1961.0," And then as soon as you start anything else like it's other stuff, you get this like giant, you know, Chris Bawks."
1961.0,1962.0, Yeah.
1962.0,1963.0, Yeah.
1963.0,1968.0," The thing about Microsoft that's scary, that's like they always come late to the party to all these things."
1968.0,1970.0, And we always laugh at them.
1970.0,1972.0," And then eventually they own it, right?"
1972.0,1973.0, Yep.
1973.0,1976.0, I mean like the macOS became Windows.
1976.0,1977.0," Uh, Internet Explorer."
1977.0,1982.0," We all used to use, well, I don't have to give you guys a computer history on gaming."
1982.0,1983.0, They don't console gaming.
1983.0,1986.0," They're still like a soft word, right?"
1986.0,1988.0," You see, I'll be word perfect."
1988.0,1989.0, We still in the day.
1989.0,1991.0, We still laugh at Internet Explorer now.
1991.0,1993.0," Yeah, you laugh at it."
1993.0,1994.0, Yeah.
1994.0,1995.0," They're laughing at you, buddy."
1995.0,1997.0, All the way to the bank.
1997.0,1999.0, I used Firefox.
1999.0,2000.0, I used Firefox.
2000.0,2001.0, And actually check out Flock.
2001.0,2002.0, If you have any chance.
2002.0,2003.0, Who?
2003.0,2004.0, There's a new browser.
2004.0,2005.0, I'm beta testing right now called Flock.
2005.0,2006.0, It's pretty cool.
2006.0,2011.0, Actually ties in with like a dick and my space for those who use it.
2011.0,2012.0, It's cut.
2012.0,2014.0, I don't use my space.
2014.0,2015.0," Well, I think it's pretty cool."
2015.0,2016.0," Oh, no."
2016.0,2017.0, It's just really a fine one.
2017.0,2018.0," I mean, I mean,"
2018.0,2020.0, I use my space on.
2020.0,2021.0," Oh, you don't."
2021.0,2024.0," Oh, well, what's your URL, Ralphie?"
2024.0,2026.0, He doesn't just slap the building.
2026.0,2027.0, You don't want to do this.
2027.0,2030.0," Yeah, we don't want to see that site."
2030.0,2031.0, All right.
2031.0,2034.0," One other big, big news item either, Dern."
2034.0,2035.0, Okay.
2035.0,2037.0, One other little bit of news.
2037.0,2038.0, I'll skip.
2038.0,2041.0," You know, actually, I'll skip ahead one quick thing though before I get it."
2041.0,2042.0, Windows Vista.
2042.0,2045.0, They have a official list of all the games coming out with Vista.
2045.0,2046.0, Ah.
2046.0,2047.0, So let's just go through this quick.
2047.0,2048.0, It's interesting.
2048.0,2052.0, Okay. So here. Here are all the games you get for free with the OS solitaire.
2052.0,2053.0, Thank you.
2053.0,2055.0, I was afraid I was going to have it.
2055.0,2056.0, My sweeper.
2056.0,2057.0, My sweeper.
2057.0,2058.0, Yes.
2058.0,2059.0, Yes.
2059.0,2061.0, We got some free sell.
2061.0,2062.0," Oh, baby."
2062.0,2063.0, Parts.
2063.0,2064.0, Yes.
2064.0,2065.0, Spider-cell it's there.
2065.0,2066.0, You know what?
2066.0,2067.0, This is off.
2067.0,2069.0, They are really going out on alignment with this stuff.
2069.0,2070.0," Well, they're starting."
2070.0,2072.0, They're this effectively destroys pop cap.
2072.0,2073.0," And then from there,"
2073.0,2074.0, like everyone else.
2074.0,2075.0, Yeah.
2075.0,2076.0," Well, actually, here's where it gets crazy."
2076.0,2077.0, Titan chests.
2077.0,2078.0, A 3D chest game.
2078.0,2080.0, 3D 3D chest.
2080.0,2081.0, Wow.
2081.0,2084.0, Majon Titans.
2084.0,2088.0, Purple placed is a pavillus.
2088.0,2089.0, Sony launch.
2089.0,2091.0, It totally is going to come to you.
2091.0,2094.0, It's a PSP gift.
2094.0,2097.0, Purple Palace.
2097.0,2099.0, It's a kid's concentration game.
2099.0,2100.0, Purple.
2100.0,2101.0, Purple.
2101.0,2102.0, Yeah.
2102.0,2103.0, It's not purple.
2103.0,2104.0, P-U-R-B-L-E.
2104.0,2105.0, They put about like even their OS.
2105.0,2106.0, They're like even their OS.
2106.0,2108.0," They're like, what about be jooled or something is so low."
2108.0,2109.0, They got some gone.
2109.0,2110.0, Maybe the good stuff's coming.
2110.0,2112.0," They actually, the last one's called Ink Ball."
2112.0,2115.0, It's some kind of like game that was coming off for tablet PCs.
2115.0,2117.0, They couldn't even get a while in an ultimate.
2117.0,2118.0, Can't move it.
2118.0,2119.0, This is news.
2119.0,2120.0, Wait.
2120.0,2121.0, Okay.
2121.0,2122.0, What happened to the space?
2122.0,2123.0, Get a halo.
2123.0,2124.0, Penball game.
2124.0,2125.0, I missed the pinball game.
2125.0,2126.0, Hold on.
2126.0,2127.0, Hang on.
2127.0,2128.0, I know.
2128.0,2129.0," You know what, too."
2129.0,2130.0, I have an important question.
2130.0,2131.0, Yes.
2131.0,2132.0, Fire.
2132.0,2134.0, What's the difference between solitary and spider solitary?
2134.0,2135.0, Instead of car.
2135.0,2136.0," Never tried with, uh,"
2136.0,2137.0, Blackpink and Queens.
2137.0,2138.0, Wow.
2138.0,2139.0, It's got spider-nine.
2139.0,2140.0, It's spider-nine.
2140.0,2142.0, It's cute the way he doesn't know these things.
2142.0,2143.0," Oh, I have no clue."
2143.0,2144.0, I have no clue.
2144.0,2146.0, I don't feel the spider-kings.
2146.0,2147.0, It's by that.
2147.0,2148.0, Salat's hair.
2148.0,2149.0, This is embarrassing.
2149.0,2150.0, It's embarrassing.
2150.0,2151.0, It's embarrassing.
2151.0,2152.0, What?
2152.0,2154.0, Why can't announce that list?
2154.0,2155.0, What?
2155.0,2156.0, Thank you.
2156.0,2157.0," It's like, yeah."
2157.0,2158.0, You're right.
2158.0,2160.0," I'm like, hey, why do you announce that?"
2160.0,2162.0, Those things have been in windows all long.
2162.0,2165.0," It's like, if you, if you actually add for a new, like, three, three"
2165.0,2166.0," dichas, man."
2166.0,2168.0," Which is my birthday, tell me your name or whatever."
2168.0,2169.0, Her full list.
2169.0,2170.0, For a whole list.
2170.0,2172.0," I wasn't thinking of upgrading my OS, but not that an"
2172.0,2173.0, little bit per bull.
2173.0,2175.0, Come on.
2175.0,2178.0, Her book can you give us like a pseudo-coucou game or something?
2178.0,2179.0, Yeah.
2179.0,2180.0, Why?
2180.0,2181.0, Do you know that?
2181.0,2182.0," A little bit smart, Ryan."
2182.0,2183.0, Your hired.
2183.0,2184.0," Oh, what?"
2184.0,2185.0, So cool.
2185.0,2186.0," Oh, there you go."
2186.0,2187.0, You see it.
2187.0,2188.0, Out of his.
2188.0,2189.0," Oh, the kids loves the doco."
2189.0,2190.0," And that's not asking for much, isn't it?"
2190.0,2191.0, Seriously.
2191.0,2192.0, I've done this one.
2192.0,2193.0, All right.
2193.0,2195.0, Last up in the news this week.
2195.0,2200.0, AMD bought ATI for $5.4 billion.
2200.0,2201.0, How to deal?
2201.0,2207.0," So, I mean, it's a big deal for, you know, the fact that, you know, this is happening."
2207.0,2208.0," Yeah, I'm position's happening."
2208.0,2209.0," But I mean, what do the implications?"
2209.0,2212.0," I mean, does this mean that an integrated graphics board?"
2212.0,2214.0," Like, you know, you don't need to buy a separate graphics card."
2214.0,2217.0," You're actually, like, perform from day one."
2217.0,2220.0, Single chip solutions for notebooks.
2220.0,2224.0," But I, I, I, there's a, I'll quote that I dug up from, I think was, the interview,"
2224.0,2225.0, Nvidia's Derek Perez.
2225.0,2226.0, And he's a buddy of mine.
2226.0,2227.0, Good guy.
2227.0,2228.0," But this quote I had, I had to call him on."
2228.0,2230.0, This is from firing squad.com.
2230.0,2233.0," So Derek says, if you think about it, it's kind of like,"
2233.0,2234.0," ATI is thrown in the towel, right?"
2234.0,2236.0," Getting beat on both ends, looking for a way out."
2236.0,2237.0, A little bit like 3.0.0.0.
2237.0,2238.0, A little bit like 3.0.0.0.0.0.
2238.0,2239.0, If X a few years back.
2239.0,2243.0," Now, is it just me, but didn't Nvidia, like,"
2243.0,2245.0, merge with 3D effects or buy them out?
2245.0,2246.0," And it's, I don't know."
2246.0,2248.0," It just seems a little funny him, like,"
2248.0,2250.0, citing 3D effects in that one.
2250.0,2252.0," But, uh, I don't know."
2252.0,2254.0," I think he's, it definitely interesting times ahead."
2254.0,2257.0," And, uh, I'm all for, like, having a more uniform system."
2257.0,2259.0, Me too.
2259.0,2260.0, Less components to buy.
2260.0,2262.0," Well, anytime you have something,"
2262.0,2264.0," if it's on board though,"
2264.0,2267.0," I mean, you're going to have to still upgrade your graphics card at some point."
2267.0,2269.0," Well, you will at some point, but it's nice to know you have some kind of, like,"
2269.0,2271.0, solid-based level to work off of.
2272.0,2274.0," I mean, the, the, the, like, the, the one that's, I mean,"
2274.0,2276.0," you can ask Mark Rain about this, who, uh,"
2276.0,2278.0," is, been pretty vocalist of the, you know,"
2278.0,2279.0," Intel's, the X-ray graphics card."
2279.0,2283.0," Mark Rain is, Mark Rain, uh, VP of Epic Games."
2283.0,2286.0," Uh, basically, uh, he's been very vocal in the press about how,"
2286.0,2289.0, into Intel's integrated graphics solutions are pretty much
2289.0,2290.0, killed PC gaming.
2290.0,2293.0," So, maybe this is a step of the right direction."
2293.0,2294.0," Well, another integrated."
2294.0,2295.0," Well, an integrated one."
2295.0,2297.0," Well, integration is the thing."
2297.0,2300.0," Yeah, but how, how well known as Intel for its graphics cards."
2301.0,2302.0, Right. That's kind of a point.
2302.0,2305.0," So, because you don't, it's like, I don't want to buy a, you know,"
2305.0,2309.0, the one thing when I'm like one Ryan says I'm going to have to upgrade the other down the line.
2309.0,2311.0," And it means that one, the only thing I'm going to,"
2311.0,2315.0," I'm going to have to get a TI to fit with this,"
2315.0,2316.0, and that's the end of my options.
2316.0,2318.0, Or not necessarily.
2318.0,2320.0," I mean, you have, you have, you have motherboards,"
2320.0,2323.0," and you could fit an TI or in, or in video."
2323.0,2324.0," I mean, it's a standardized plug."
2324.0,2325.0, It goes into it.
2325.0,2327.0," The difference here is, instead of having a crap-based level,"
2327.0,2328.0, you have a good-based level.
2328.0,2332.0," So it's like, you, you start at zero or 50,"
2332.0,2334.0," and then you get one, you get to 100."
2334.0,2335.0, Hmm.
2335.0,2336.0, Why could you get an X-Box 360?
2336.0,2337.0, Or you just get an X-Box 360.
2337.0,2338.0, Or you just get an X-Box 360 in your home house.
2338.0,2339.0, And Chrome house.
2339.0,2343.0," I mean, if the motherboards, if the integrated graphics cards come with,"
2343.0,2346.0," without a huge jump in price, then that's exactly it."
2346.0,2349.0," I mean, if it doesn't affect the price, I'm fine with it."
2349.0,2351.0," I mean, it, it can only mean good things."
2351.0,2352.0," I, I like to think."
2352.0,2356.0, There's the whole gateway drug thing that works too.
2356.0,2358.0," I mean, once you get someone in the door,"
2358.0,2359.0," I mean, it's just kind of worked for me."
2359.0,2362.0," I was playing, you know, team Fortress 2, a software rendering."
2362.0,2367.0," And it was, you know, team Fortress 1, you software, right?"
2367.0,2370.0," And if not for that, I might not have a cover PC game,"
2370.0,2372.0," or at least not, you know, for several years after that."
2372.0,2375.0," And then it was at that point then, I began doing the research and saying,"
2375.0,2377.0," okay, this is a dead end that I got here."
2377.0,2379.0," It was this little, little,"
2379.0,2382.0," this little gateway box that was, you know,"
2382.0,2383.0, couldn't do anything to it.
2383.0,2385.0, It had on on board solution.
2385.0,2386.0, That was it.
2386.0,2387.0, No slots or anything.
2387.0,2390.0," And it got my foot in the door and then from then on, you know,"
2390.0,2392.0," rest his history, I guess."
2392.0,2394.0, So do we all build our own machines?
2394.0,2398.0," Actually, I think that was one of our questions, which I can merge into."
2398.0,2401.0," Now, yes, that came from Robert Baron,"
2401.0,2402.0, Kalamity Merit.
2402.0,2404.0," Yes, on the message board."
2404.0,2408.0, Does the CGW staff prefer to build or buy their personal computers?
2408.0,2411.0," So, are we all builders here?"
2411.0,2412.0," Yes, I'm builder."
2412.0,2413.0, Builder.
2414.0,2415.0, John?
2415.0,2417.0, I haven't built my own yet.
2417.0,2419.0, I've changed the parts of the company.
2419.0,2420.0, Parts of Lenny and I bought one.
2420.0,2422.0, I had him built specifically for me.
2422.0,2423.0, Yeah.
2423.0,2424.0, I threw eBay and stuff.
2424.0,2426.0," But I'm not, you're not buying like a Dell."
2426.0,2428.0," But I'm not, oh, no, no, no."
2428.0,2432.0," No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, can't have that on like that."
2432.0,2434.0," Actually, that is a good deal."
2434.0,2435.0, I found something really cheap.
2435.0,2437.0, My last PC on eBay.
2437.0,2440.0," And it was like, you know, the guy just hears all the parts I have."
2440.0,2444.0," I put them together for you and send them in like, you know, 350 bucks."
2444.0,2445.0, And it was good enough to play.
2445.0,2446.0, That was a great deal.
2446.0,2447.0, It was pretty stable.
2447.0,2448.0, Hasn't had any problem.
2448.0,2450.0," I mean, I've upgraded since then."
2450.0,2452.0," I mean, it got me through, you know, Battlefield 42,"
2452.0,2454.0, Battlefield Vietnam up through that era.
2454.0,2457.0," And then, since then, I upgraded for Battlefield 2."
2457.0,2458.0, But it was a good deal.
2458.0,2460.0, I definitely would do business with them again.
2460.0,2463.0," You really kind of have, I mean, it's sort of like you said,"
2463.0,2466.0," like, maybe if you buy it, complete, but then swap out."
2466.0,2468.0," I mean, at some point, if you're sure, it's about your gaming."
2468.0,2471.0," You can't just have a, yeah, closed box sort of."
2471.0,2473.0," Right. You have to, yeah, you have to keep switching."
2473.0,2474.0, I think it's kind of the notion of PC gaming in general.
2474.0,2476.0," It's, no, I don't think anyone really goes for like closed box,"
2476.0,2478.0," steal anymore, unless they like, you know, somebody's mom."
2478.0,2479.0, Right. Right.
2479.0,2480.0, We'll get a council.
2480.0,2484.0," Yeah, I was sitting in a focus group last night with a bunch of CGW subscribers."
2484.0,2486.0, And everyone of them build their own PC.
2486.0,2487.0, Mm-hmm.
2487.0,2488.0, It's just probably the nature of it.
2488.0,2490.0," So that's, that's your answer."
2490.0,2493.0, We prefer to build that CGW.
2493.0,2495.0, Let's see.
2495.0,2498.0, A couple other reader questions before we sign off.
2498.0,2500.0, We'll look for the juicy ones.
2500.0,2502.0, There's one about my tight pants.
2502.0,2504.0, We're going to skip up at that.
2504.0,2506.0, Just wait for the juicyness.
2506.0,2507.0, Yeah.
2507.0,2509.0," That just, stop."
2509.0,2510.0, Let's see.
2510.0,2516.0," We have, well, let's see if we can get this question down to Marba Nutshow."
2516.0,2517.0," I sort of, I think it's interesting."
2517.0,2522.0, So first one on here from Renee Almond or Almond.
2522.0,2523.0, Very fancy.
2524.0,2525.0, Yeah.
2525.0,2528.0, It's a fancy almond because it doesn't eat the end of the night.
2528.0,2534.0," He asked us about the prey, save games, or the end game."
2534.0,2536.0," Or lack of end game situation, I should say."
2536.0,2541.0," He's, he asks, Mary says the topic was brushed on in the last podcast talking about prey."
2541.0,2545.0, You don't really die just duck hunt for a while and you're back and ready to go.
2545.0,2546.0, So yeah.
2546.0,2547.0, Spiritual duck hunt.
2547.0,2549.0," Our game spiritual is, you know, in trademark hunting."
2549.0,2551.0, I'm getting too easy to play.
2551.0,2553.0, Big bosses are not big bosses anymore.
2553.0,2555.0," And quake in a lab, blah, blah, blah."
2555.0,2557.0, It's weird because I'm playing.
2557.0,2560.0, One of the last time you actually read the words game over.
2560.0,2561.0, Right.
2561.0,2562.0, What's our take on this?
2562.0,2567.0," I was playing prey on Cherokee mode, which is the version of hard."
2567.0,2568.0, And.
2568.0,2569.0, Yeah.
2569.0,2571.0," Is it the, the scalps scalps?"
2571.0,2577.0, I actually had the only hard part of it was the very beginning of the game before you.
2577.0,2579.0," No, you can spiritually duck hunt."
2579.0,2581.0, That's the only time I've ever seen a game over screen.
2581.0,2583.0, It was weird for like the first 10 minutes.
2583.0,2584.0, Hmm.
2584.0,2586.0, Like I died a couple times and had to reload.
2586.0,2587.0," Oh, wow."
2587.0,2588.0, Wow.
2588.0,2592.0, Why is the beginning of the game harder than after you get to the point where you can spiritually duck hunt?
2592.0,2595.0, And then suddenly it's exactly the same kind of cake block.
2595.0,2598.0, I may have visited the spirit realm a couple more times.
2598.0,2599.0, Hmm.
2599.0,2601.0," But otherwise, like, well, why is this hard?"
2601.0,2602.0," Well, because."
2602.0,2604.0," Well, that's the, that's the problem."
2604.0,2605.0, Yeah.
2605.0,2606.0, You have the spiritual duck hunt.
2606.0,2608.0, You could just keep going and where is it a problem?
2608.0,2610.0," I, I like the thing."
2610.0,2612.0, I'm going to stand up and say I liked it.
2612.0,2613.0, And I might not have finished it.
2613.0,2614.0, So I wasn't reviewing it.
2614.0,2615.0, I might not have even finished it.
2615.0,2616.0, If not for that.
2616.0,2620.0," Because once they started throwing the same enemy encounters that you over and over again,"
2620.0,2624.0," where it's like, OK, look, I know there's going to be two of the big floaty blob guys here."
2624.0,2625.0, There's going to be another one here.
2625.0,2626.0, Excuse me.
2626.0,2627.0, They haven't named it.
2627.0,2628.0, Yeah.
2628.0,2629.0," And if I die, I don't know what it is."
2629.0,2630.0, Okay.
2630.0,2632.0, If Shartalk one one appears here.
2633.0,2634.0, And then in easy to get.
2634.0,2636.0, The blob is or comes out on this side.
2636.0,2637.0, Yeah.
2637.0,2638.0, The charers are.
2638.0,2640.0," So it's like, if I kept doing that."
2640.0,2643.0," And you know, and if I kept dying on, it's just like, yeah."
2643.0,2647.0, So I didn't have a problem because I wanted to keep playing through the game.
2647.0,2649.0, And it's a long enough game as it is.
2649.0,2651.0, I feel like I got my money's worth playing it.
2651.0,2652.0, Yeah.
2652.0,2654.0," You know, even with the spiritual duck hunt going through."
2654.0,2656.0," And for me, it takes a really good."
2656.0,2658.0," The harder a game is, the better it has to be."
2658.0,2659.0, Right.
2659.0,2660.0, And especially the older I get.
2660.0,2663.0," So I mean, I think a lot of the, you know, our games too easy now."
2663.0,2667.0," It's like, you know, we all remember when we were, you know, what seven years old."
2667.0,2669.0," I mean, it's going to differ what we're playing for each of us."
2669.0,2672.0," You, you are playing some, you know, LCD football or whatever."
2672.0,2674.0, But hopefully like you're being generous.
2674.0,2679.0," So if I'm playing on sticks, I play the original Castlevania on a 10-door, right?"
2679.0,2680.0," You're like, we'll down the street."
2680.0,2682.0, So there's no save.
2682.0,2683.0, There's no password.
2683.0,2684.0, There's nothing like that in the game.
2684.0,2685.0, And then there's no one overnight.
2685.0,2686.0, But not only hard.
2686.0,2687.0, You leave it on overnight.
2687.0,2688.0, But you keep playing.
2688.0,2689.0, You keep playing.
2689.0,2690.0, That's what else do I have to do?
2690.0,2692.0," Like Frankenstein, kill me eight times."
2692.0,2693.0, Who cares?
2693.0,2694.0, Like I'll just come back and what business.
2694.0,2699.0," But like now, if Frankenstein beats me three times, then screw him up like again."
2699.0,2700.0, I'm done.
2700.0,2701.0, Yeah.
2701.0,2704.0," You know, so I mean, there's so many games out there and multiplayer games too."
2704.0,2708.0, It's like I could be playing pre-email or I could be playing either it's multiplayer or another game.
2708.0,2710.0, And talking with people and enjoying myself.
2710.0,2716.0," So I just, I just, I just, I just felt like if you didn't like, you know, if you were so good that you weren't going to die,"
2716.0,2718.0," then I mean, then what you care."
2718.0,2725.0," You know, if you, if you, if you can get through it without going into the spirit world, then, you know, bully for you."
2725.0,2727.0," Point them to point them to far cry, you know."
2727.0,2728.0," You mean, yeah."
2728.0,2729.0, Yeah.
2729.0,2733.0," I mean, the only thing that I, because I died quite a lot because I kind of suck."
2733.0,2738.0, And I appreciated that I didn't have to go to an end game screen and then a reload or whatever.
2738.0,2746.0, But I did think that there were sometimes when they could have had the hell go back up on the monsters that I had killed already.
2746.0,2749.0, Like it almost seemed like kind of a cheat.
2749.0,2751.0," It is, it is, it is."
2751.0,2754.0," Yeah, it is like, like tight requests works that way."
2754.0,2760.0," So you know, when you die and come back, I mean, obviously it's a totally different game."
2760.0,2764.0," It's an RPG, but if you die in the middle of a boss encounter, they have their own comeback."
2764.0,2767.0," Their health is, is back up to max."
2767.0,2770.0," The interesting to find out if that was something they added like after play testing,"
2770.0,2774.0," maybe people were playing it and going, having maybe the Sean issue where they like,"
2774.0,2775.0, I don't really want to play this.
2775.0,2776.0, I have to keep reloading.
2776.0,2777.0, It's not that good.
2777.0,2779.0," And then, we said, okay, well, what's that?"
2779.0,2783.0," There's death mechanic where you're like, you know, it's not that annoying anymore."
2783.0,2784.0, So now do you want to keep playing?
2784.0,2785.0, Yeah.
2785.0,2786.0, Yeah.
2786.0,2787.0, So I finish it.
2787.0,2790.0," I think the idea of like, you know, that you have to go through a game and like,"
2790.0,2792.0, keep keeping the game over screen people.
2792.0,2798.0," You know what, I think the more I think of it, the function of the spiritual duck sort of exist in most games."
2798.0,2800.0," Anyway, that have a quick save function."
2800.0,2801.0, Yeah.
2801.0,2804.0," And although like, pressing pause or something, that's not internal to the dynamic of the game."
2804.0,2806.0, It's kind of this outside activity.
2806.0,2807.0, Right.
2807.0,2811.0," You, it still becomes attached to it as a game in and of itself, you know, like, when should I press this?"
2811.0,2812.0, Should I do it now?
2812.0,2813.0," Like, I've got just enough health."
2813.0,2814.0, Do I really want to do it here?
2814.0,2815.0, And you keep doing it.
2815.0,2819.0," So it's like, because it's just turned into something that's integral and it's inside the game."
2819.0,2820.0, Right.
2820.0,2825.0," I think that's the difference is kind of like when you have a quick save or whatever, you're working outside of the parameters of the game."
2825.0,2826.0, Right.
2826.0,2827.0, You're still part of the game though.
2827.0,2828.0, Right.
2828.0,2830.0," But I mean, it's like you're not actually like, yeah, no, it's not a size of game."
2830.0,2831.0, Exactly.
2831.0,2832.0," But in your mind, it serves as part of the game."
2832.0,2833.0, Exactly.
2833.0,2841.0," So thinking, because they're, I got to ask, did, did, have you all, in a game with quick save, quick saved, like, at the exact wrong moment."
2841.0,2843.0," Like, so you've really, yeah, eternal death."
2843.0,2844.0," Oh, yeah."
2844.0,2845.0, Yeah.
2845.0,2848.0," Like the second that you're like, ready for the fall off a ledge or something."
2848.0,2850.0, So then it reloads and you're just dying.
2850.0,2851.0, Or you were just desperate.
2851.0,2855.0," You had like one health, you know, one little health bar left and like five bullets on that."
2855.0,2856.0, That sucks.
2856.0,2861.0," And then you keep trying, even though you're like, hey, the previous save isn't that much, you know, isn't too far back."
2861.0,2863.0," But I'm just going to try that for like, maybe I'm talking about it."
2863.0,2864.0, Maybe I can't stop.
2864.0,2872.0," And the other thing, I think a lot of people, because God mode and no clip are so easy to access and PC shooters."
2872.0,2876.0, I think a lot more people than some people with respect to use those.
2876.0,2877.0, And so that's the other thing.
2877.0,2883.0," Do you want people that end up wasting all the effort you put in your game, turn it on, God mode, or do you want to play some spiritual duck hunt?"
2883.0,2888.0, Maybe that's why I don't like it because I'm the kind of person who just the last thing I would do is turn on God mode.
2888.0,2891.0," Yeah, I did, I've done it."
2891.0,2898.0," Like the original Half Life, there was parts at the end where I was like, you know, like the damn floating sack crap in the end."
2898.0,2900.0," The last guy was like, I didn't know what I was supposed to do."
2900.0,2901.0," No, that actually was."
2901.0,2904.0," So I turned on God mode, damn, one of the sack of crap."
2904.0,2906.0, That was the name in the manual.
2906.0,2907.0, Yeah.
2909.0,2911.0, Sack Lord.
2911.0,2913.0, Just been asked with him.
2913.0,2918.0," So like, well, what's the concern with, you know, he asked our games getting too easy to play."
2918.0,2920.0," Like what if they are, what's wrong with that?"
2920.0,2922.0, Is there anything wrong?
2922.0,2923.0, We want to see them.
2923.0,2924.0, Let's see how to challenge.
2924.0,2927.0," Don't you like a challenge, Ryan?"
2927.0,2929.0," Well, I guess within reason."
2929.0,2933.0," I mean, if like, like you said, if I play a game and it's too hard,"
2933.0,2936.0," and I have to keep reloading, I'm going to move on to something else."
2936.0,2938.0," In most cases, the difficulty levels are there."
2938.0,2941.0," While they don't make the AI anymore intelligent, they do the obvious."
2941.0,2943.0, They make the AI more accurate.
2943.0,2947.0," They make you take greater damage in your, you do less damage."
2947.0,2950.0," And if you're, if you're a safer person, then do that."
2950.0,2951.0, Play that mode.
2951.0,2955.0," You know, I mean, so far, I mean, praise like the one game that actually has the spiritual"
2955.0,2959.0, duck hint and the whole quicksave thing implemented into the game itself.
2959.0,2963.0," But I'd like to see actually if anybody falls up sort of,"
2963.0,2965.0, imitate this sort of safe system.
2965.0,2966.0, I like that a lot.
2967.0,2970.0," But it is, I think Western games, especially are like,"
2970.0,2975.0," are much more in tune to what people sort of threshold for, for punishment is."
2975.0,2978.0," I mean, look at what Valve just did with the elevator scene."
2978.0,2981.0," And we were talking about, yeah, in the previous podcast, but it's like,"
2981.0,2984.0," can you play, like more and more, like dead rising just came out for,"
2984.0,2987.0," Xbox 360 or is about to come out, I guess,"
2987.0,2990.0, the review copies are all around here.
2990.0,2993.0, The save system on that is just so archaic and stuff.
2993.0,2997.0," And you see a lot of times, I still see games from Japan come out where they,"
2997.0,3000.0," I don't know, they just seem so behind the times, at least to, you know,"
3000.0,3002.0," Western taste and what we've gotten used to, you know,"
3002.0,3004.0, where they expect you to do something a million times.
3004.0,3008.0, And act like you're that seven year old kid and you get one game every three
3008.0,3010.0, months. And so you damn well better play the hell out of it.
3010.0,3012.0, We've got you saw one.
3012.0,3014.0, Maybe games or gamers have just gotten softer.
3014.0,3015.0," You guys, you're playing the game."
3015.0,3016.0, Got all the less times.
3016.0,3017.0," Oh, yeah."
3017.0,3018.0, Yeah.
3018.0,3019.0, Yeah.
3019.0,3020.0, That was the most notorious wasn't it?
3020.0,3021.0, Which one?
3021.0,3023.0, I enjoyed that challenge.
3023.0,3026.0, I remember even Scooter of an OPM saying it was hard.
3026.0,3028.0," And you know, that's tough game."
3028.0,3029.0, It's like not human.
3029.0,3031.0," First of all, the horrible."
3031.0,3032.0, Yeah.
3032.0,3033.0," But at the same time,"
3033.0,3034.0, that was also a really good game.
3034.0,3035.0, Yeah.
3035.0,3036.0, It's a fatal.
3036.0,3040.0," The fatal combo is a poor game with that's, it's difficult."
3040.0,3042.0," And as reviewers, you all know it,"
3042.0,3045.0," the biggest defender you've ever had wasn't just a crap game,"
3045.0,3049.0, but it was a crap game that took you a whole lot of work to get anywhere in.
3049.0,3050.0, Those are the ones that you hate.
3050.0,3052.0," That when you come home, those rare, you know,"
3052.0,3054.0," what's the year time when you come home and say,"
3054.0,3055.0, you know what?
3055.0,3057.0, Freaking sick of this job.
3057.0,3061.0, It just hits that game that's a piece of junk and it's hard.
3061.0,3062.0, Yeah.
3062.0,3063.0, Yeah.
3063.0,3064.0, Okay.
3064.0,3065.0, What's your game for that one?
3065.0,3067.0," I had, with the hell was it?"
3067.0,3070.0," I'm sure, I'm, if it was the reviews,"
3070.0,3072.0," if it was because the company was so pissed off about it,"
3072.0,3074.0," but it was the, um,"
3074.0,3075.0, evil dead.
3075.0,3077.0," It wasn't the last one, but the one before that,"
3077.0,3078.0, evil that fistful of boom stick.
3079.0,3080.0, Yeah.
3080.0,3081.0," It was infinite,"
3081.0,3082.0," regress puzzles, where it's like,"
3082.0,3084.0," okay, you need to get this key to open this gate."
3084.0,3085.0," And the same time you're fighting,"
3085.0,3086.0, respawning monsters.
3086.0,3088.0," And then, so to get the key,"
3088.0,3090.0," it turns out you find a trucker and he's like,"
3090.0,3093.0," well, I need gas for my truck before I give you the key."
3093.0,3095.0," And then you find the guy who's got the gas,"
3095.0,3097.0," and he's like, well, I need you to rescue my kitten."
3097.0,3098.0," And then the guy, you know,"
3098.0,3099.0," the kitten is like, I'm not coming down for the tree,"
3099.0,3100.0, unless you grow me a flower.
3100.0,3101.0, And then they got the flowers.
3101.0,3103.0, I'm not giving you these seeds.
3103.0,3104.0," So it's like, you're like,"
3104.0,3105.0, you're not a bull.
3105.0,3107.0," So if I can open this one gate,"
3107.0,3109.0," you're like, what the hell was I doing?"
3109.0,3111.0," Okay, so it was like a bajillionity stupid day."
3111.0,3112.0," So like, I'm saying,"
3112.0,3113.0," I'm saying, I'm saying, I'm saying,"
3113.0,3114.0," I'm saying, I'm saying, I'm saying,"
3114.0,3115.0," yeah, you don't even know how to tell him what's happening,"
3115.0,3116.0, or where you're doing.
3116.0,3117.0," And so it was just like,"
3117.0,3119.0," it was a crappy game with infinite regress puzzles,"
3119.0,3120.0, so I'm gonna talk of it.
3120.0,3122.0, And I blew my stack.
3122.0,3123.0," I punched the desk quite a bit,"
3123.0,3124.0, playing that thing.
3124.0,3125.0, And that's rare for me.
3125.0,3126.0," Yeah, Darren,"
3126.0,3127.0," you've like broken a couple keyboards,"
3127.0,3129.0," so CGW, like literally."
3129.0,3132.0," Keyboards, mice, I think you did that over good games."
3132.0,3133.0, That's true.
3133.0,3136.0," But I mean, there are some games where I actually,"
3136.0,3138.0, I remember there was a win-game.
3138.0,3139.0," I actually like, I threw the mouse,"
3139.0,3140.0," and I was so disgusted,"
3140.0,3141.0, I didn't break the mouse on the first try.
3141.0,3142.0," I actually grabbed it by the wire,"
3142.0,3145.0, and tried slamming it against the table until it finally broke.
3145.0,3146.0, Yeah.
3146.0,3147.0," And then after you thought about it,"
3147.0,3148.0," exactly, you know what?"
3148.0,3150.0," You know, the master's service to die right now."
3150.0,3151.0, That game was pretty good.
3151.0,3152.0, I think I've seen that mouse.
3152.0,3153.0," That's when I was like,"
3153.0,3155.0, did you have a free-lands free-known there?
3155.0,3156.0," I came over there,"
3156.0,3158.0, is that one mouse at the buttons all torn off.
3158.0,3159.0," Yep, that was the one."
3159.0,3161.0," Yeah, well, the reviewing mentality"
3161.0,3164.0, is just come majorly into play and situations like that.
3164.0,3165.0," Yeah, really, yeah."
3165.0,3166.0," Yeah, you're sitting there going,"
3166.0,3167.0, I've got a deadline.
3167.0,3168.0, I've got to finish this.
3168.0,3169.0," Oh, my God, I hated so much."
3169.0,3170.0, I can't get past this part.
3170.0,3172.0," Maybe like, if you're on a deadline,"
3172.0,3173.0," that prey,"
3173.0,3174.0," yeah, prey mechanics simply seems like,"
3174.0,3175.0," you know, I got to."
3175.0,3177.0," I know, that's really true."
3177.0,3178.0," I mean, I had to think of that,"
3178.0,3179.0, because I wrote through a few of prey.
3179.0,3180.0," And I was like, thank God for this."
3180.0,3182.0," I had none of those concerns,"
3182.0,3183.0, and I'm back in UM.
3183.0,3186.0," But I also knew that I felt that way the opposite way, too."
3186.0,3187.0," I mean, a game that's hard,"
3187.0,3190.0, that's pissing me off because I got to get the review done.
3190.0,3191.0," Yeah, like I always have to think,"
3191.0,3193.0, and I just mad because this is taking so long.
3193.0,3194.0, Right.
3194.0,3195.0," And what someone who actually paid money for this,"
3195.0,3196.0, be appreciating.
3196.0,3198.0," I felt that way about condemned,"
3198.0,3200.0, where everyone criticized its brevity.
3200.0,3202.0," And for me, and the reviewers did,"
3202.0,3204.0," and they're playing these marathon sessions,"
3204.0,3205.0," like, hey, Texas, dude, tomorrow,"
3205.0,3206.0, I've got to jam through it.
3206.0,3207.0," And they're like, wow, that wasn't so bad."
3207.0,3210.0," But me, the game was just so like,"
3210.0,3211.0," like nails on chalkboard,"
3211.0,3212.0," but in a good way for me,"
3212.0,3215.0," and me was just so, like, disturbing to me that,"
3215.0,3217.0, I would play one level and turn it off
3217.0,3219.0," maybe a couple days later, play another one."
3219.0,3221.0," So the thing lasted me two weeks, and I was like, hey,"
3221.0,3222.0, that was a great time.
3222.0,3225.0," You've only probably had to have an arent in like six, eight movies."
3225.0,3226.0," You know, I probably have that game,"
3226.0,3227.0," I wish they made me work more for like,"
3227.0,3229.0," trying to figure out what devices I'm supposed to use to solve,"
3229.0,3230.0," you know, look for the clues, and you know,"
3230.0,3231.0," yeah, that was bad."
3231.0,3232.0," Yeah, that's a whole other story."
3232.0,3235.0," But, but the repetitiveness of the gameplay, too,"
3235.0,3237.0," wasn't so damaging to me because again,"
3237.0,3238.0, I had it all stretched out.
3238.0,3240.0," I didn't do, you know, six hours straight"
3240.0,3243.0, and being people with the same stop sign or whatever.
3243.0,3245.0," You know, the locker door."
3245.0,3246.0, Bumphill.
3246.0,3248.0," Yeah, I think that's probably a good topic for another podcast."
3248.0,3250.0," Yeah, the endaptous."
3250.0,3252.0," You know, just a kind of thinking we have to go through."
3252.0,3253.0, We do these games.
3253.0,3256.0," And CGW, when we do our review slash viewpoints,"
3256.0,3259.0, we each of us do far fewer than a lot of people do it.
3259.0,3260.0, Other outlets.
3260.0,3263.0," I mean, there was like a month at EGM when I did 13 reviews"
3263.0,3266.0, in a single month in addition to other stuff.
