0.0,9.5," Hello and welcome to GFW radio. This is the podcast for March 12th, 2007."
9.5,12.5, 8. Fuck 2008.
12.5,14.0," Okay, I can't do it."
14.0,27.0, You got the name of the podcast this time. Damn it. You know what? This reminds me before I let you guys introduce yourself which we have to do because Blizzard said so.
27.0,36.0," And I do whatever Blizzard says is that Dell computer, these motherfuckers, I hope they're not sponsoring the show because I'm going to rant about them for a second."
36.0,42.0," I bought a laptop from them a couple years ago and we've been, we did like their payment plan so I'd have to pay it all at once."
42.0,46.0, And I paid it off and full this December. It's past December. It's now March.
46.0,53.0," And they've been calling my goddamn house that we get their automated like, please call our customer support center like 20 times a day."
54.0,62.0," Even though the things all paid off and like my wife who asked to deal with the shit because I'm here fucking around all day. She's the one at home. I said like, manager, everything."
62.0,73.0," She's been blowing a gasket over the singing conglomerate and keeps telling them we paid it in full. She has to go through all the like, you know, Indian support, you know, the outsourcing over and over and over."
73.0,81.0, She's trying to get to talk to somebody at Dell in Texas. She finally does after like after months of this like phone harassment by these guys.
81.0,108.0," And I'm calling it her asmic because we paid it off. It was done. It was a done deal. And it turns out that the reason they've been phone bombing us is because when they put the thing in saying paid in full like our last payment, which we made on time, by the way, the person in at Dell who did it signed it off paid in full December, whatever 12, 2008."
109.0,120.0," Okay, that's why I told that whole story because of me getting the year wrong just now. So because even I don't let it be less than to you, you should be very careful when saying the date."
120.0,121.0," Yeah, exactly."
121.0,137.0," Even if it's too far, what, it leave it to me to bring them to the light of day, bring them your wife was threatening the phone support people with you building your cudgel of Xanthorbe being an editor for a prominent PC game."
137.0,140.0," Yeah, you would he'll blog about this."
140.0,142.0, He'll blog about this.
142.0,144.0, You told me this in shame.
144.0,147.0," Yeah, like, oh no, God, honey, don't say that."
147.0,148.0, I'm doing it.
148.0,149.0, Here you are.
149.0,151.0, You're I am peeing them down with your cudgel.
151.0,156.0," Yeah, but now that's all fixed now, supposedly. So I don't have to rag on Dell. They're good people."
156.0,157.0, You put it.
157.0,158.0," Yeah, no, that's true."
158.0,163.0," Because she was really gone nuts. You know, it's like because you get off the phone with these people and like,"
163.0,168.0," okay, yes, ma'am, it's all taken care of. And then, you know, two hours later, we get the automated thing again."
168.0,175.0," So she finally blew a gasket and I was in the room when she was like, you know, my husband works at a national magazine and he has a blog."
175.0,178.0, A lot of people reading and you don't know what you're dealing with.
178.0,180.0," It's like, oh, don't do that."
180.0,182.0, Don't play that card.
182.0,183.0, No.
183.0,186.0," So what was it like when they found the error? Was it like, no, it's all right. Let's see."
186.0,189.0, It's just December 20.
190.0,192.0," Oh, I'm so sorry."
192.0,194.0," Yeah, that's how it does."
194.0,197.0," Oh, it was our fault all along."
197.0,201.0, I'm sure the person you talked to that last time had never talked to you the nine thousand other times too.
201.0,203.0, Right. Was never the same person because that's what it happened.
203.0,207.0," That was part of the frustration to say, would say, you know, the guy would say, like, okay, man,"
207.0,209.0," my understand, I understand your frustration."
209.0,211.0, We don't want to lose. He was a customer.
211.0,214.0," Yeah, I next time this happens, I want you to call me personally."
214.0,219.0," Well, no, I can't give you my name, but here's my badge number. It's 82457."
219.0,224.0," So then my mom, my wife calls back and it's like, oh, well, there's a point."
224.0,227.0," Sometimes I call her mommy, but we don't talk about that."
227.0,234.0," Oh, yeah, then she would call back, you know, and say, like, no, I don't want to go through all this again."
234.0,239.0," I was told I could just ask for badge number 83457 and they'll go, what?"
239.0,242.0," Well, we don't use badge numbers here. It'd be some bullshit like that."
242.0,244.0, Where she can't ever get back to the same thing.
244.0,252.0," To be fair, some GFW subscriber has had his or her version of this with our subscription phone line or something."
252.0,256.0," Oh, yeah, also that's over, like a $15 magazine subscription."
256.0,258.0," Oh, that's a dollar computer."
258.0,259.0, Yeah.
259.0,263.0," Or subscription that they never asked for that we gave them, and that's sure it's charging them for."
263.0,265.0," Yeah, it happens all the time too."
265.0,267.0, Otherwise known as how we get revenue.
267.0,268.0," Yeah, that's called."
268.0,271.0, It's called like looking up people in the other pages.
271.0,274.0, It's called garbage circuit in the publishing business.
274.0,275.0," Oh, really?"
275.0,281.0," Yeah, they just like spam out subscriptions to people, you know, just so they could, so we can say, I'm saying, I said that."
281.0,282.0, Just ran into we randomly.
282.0,288.0," Well, they might be based on like, because they had a subscription to PC magazine like 20 years ago."
288.0,292.0," Yeah, so they're like, oh, hey, let's give this guy a CGW subscription or GFW subscription."
292.0,295.0, And then we can say we have this many subscribers.
295.0,297.0," And then we get the angry letter back from his wife saying,"
297.0,299.0, he died 15 years ago.
299.0,301.0," And when he was alive, he hated games."
301.0,303.0, So fuck you.
303.0,307.0, Because we've sent them like the the collection notice from the collection.
307.0,311.0," So yeah, from the subscription they never wanted."

457.82,467.74, exciting so yeah so I went to this media day Blizzard yesterday they were
467.74,473.5, showing off the zerg and stark graph two so I was there with the gaggle of
473.5,477.90000000000003, game's journalist the usual crowd of buffoons and smelly retards
478.21999999999997,496.21999999999997, you know the pile of brownies and the sodas and the chips for everybody to
496.21999999999997,501.41999999999996, continue to get fat on while we played stark graph two all day so they knew
501.42,508.7, what our diet was and they gladly fed it to us while we sat there and played but
508.7,514.14, no it was it was fun but I do want to say uh because there's been eight million reports
514.14,517.9, about every aspect of this online already but not as many people have talked about
518.46,526.0600000000001, the place itself because they moved Blizzard moved and before Blizzard was always in a
526.0600000000001,529.4200000000001, Sean Lloyd you've been there and I don't know who else in the stream has been down the
530.38,536.2199999999999, but they're in a you know business park in Irvine totally not described actually they're
536.2199999999999,541.74, still in a business park in Irvine but before it was it looked like it could be whatever you know
542.86,550.2199999999999, unitech exactly yeah any random thing and now now you see it's like what more what you would
550.2199999999999,555.3399999999999, expect especially you know this is totally the house that world of warcraft built you know as the
555.34,560.94, cab is driving up really looks now like you're you're coming up to a movie studio they have this
560.94,567.6600000000001, huge Blizzard entertainment arch going over the thing over these like two giant black iron gates
567.6600000000001,573.34, that's got a security booth in the front of it you know our cabby they wouldn't even let our cab
573.34,580.3000000000001, into the place until like those of us in the cab were identified and cleared to enter and you know
581.26,588.62, it's it's totally like a big a big time deal now they have their own restaurant inside their own gym
591.3399999999999,596.14, even the coke machine like every coke machine has it was like painted custom painted sort of like a
596.14,603.66, 70s van you know with like warcraft shit on and stuff like that oh that's how they're own museum inside
603.74,609.18, they're own museum and not just own museum a full-time curator on staff
609.18,614.54, wow this job is to do what does what boxes what's what I said it was like didn't they do their
614.54,618.86, job because they set this up now now what do they do all day that now they're documenting
618.86,624.4599999999999, the ongoing history well what the PR person said when I asked that snarky question was
624.4599999999999,628.6999999999999, well there are a lot of walls in these buildings so I guess they're gonna they're gonna work on
628.7,633.0200000000001, the other walls there's three buildings now it was so is this just for the employees like
633.0200000000001,638.38, because you visit big security gate outside so right but I guess it's for like when they do
638.38,643.6600000000001, Dane to open you know wonka's chocolate factory and let people in they've got all the stuff on the
643.6600000000001,647.6600000000001, wall and there actually was cool stuff on the wall like there was um uh
648.22,654.86, bass in behind glass they had like every script script draft of the south park
655.34,660.0600000000001, World Warcraft episode behind glass so it's like you know 20 revisions of the thing
660.62,662.38, along with the emmy that they won for it
664.46,668.38, other brand of crap like that you guys aren't looking at them pressed wasn't that impressive
668.38,671.82, no I'm impressed I'm actually sitting here thinking about how was I hey living in Northern California
671.82,677.82, because all you ever hear about it's how people work in these fantastic office spaces with you know
677.9000000000001,687.4200000000001, cafeterias that have their own uh organic farm fresh chefs and yeah the misuse and uh all these crazy things
687.4200000000001,691.98, and yeah well they're they're restaurant work I live in if I if I had thought of it I meant to
691.98,696.7, bring the menu in because it was printed out and I was gonna read off some items but everything is like you
696.7,701.5, know like there's this whole uh intro page before you actually get to the menu which is like basically
701.5,705.9000000000001, explaining like why you should probably eat healthy but it's probably a good thing to tell people
705.98,712.3, who work in the games industry so you know but all the menu items have like you know organic fresh egg
712.3,717.26, blah blah blah blah but the cool thing too is that they all also well cool is with air quotes is
717.26,722.4599999999999, most of them have like you know wow names attached to them oh my god he's had stew there he
722.4599999999999,726.38, go they should they should try to explain the health shon is grim as I'm gonna let's
726.38,730.9399999999999, try to explain the health thing like in terms of RPG player could understand like you know
730.94,737.74, whole grains give you you know plus one against cancer or something yeah yeah no for the metal
737.74,742.7800000000001, gear salt three when I came out they sent a promo was a cana snake meat it said uh and I was hoping
742.7800000000001,747.74, it was real snake meat because he is a game sometimes snake eater so I found someone on the message
747.74,753.82, board and I told him I'd give him this collectible can but on the condition that he has to eat whatever
754.7800000000001,760.86, and talk you man it was with photographs so uh I did and I was bummed out as
760.86,765.1800000000001, fuck because it was clam chowder inside of it he ate the cold you know like he didn't cook it
765.1800000000001,770.5400000000001, or on the eat the canbob like you got a few men you got a can with salt snake on it all you had to
770.5400000000001,775.1, eat with some cold cold water honestly where do you think they're gonna pick up can snake meat
775.1,780.3800000000001, like we're doing the rout to be eating some of the snake somewhere south these days or something
780.46,785.1, there has to be like I don't know I've had like Vietnamese liquor when it's you know the kind
785.1,791.1, that's like served it's it's held in a big giant container full with like snakes and and
791.1,795.74, seahorses and basically all sorts of fabric like creatures anything that's like remotely
797.1,803.66, to the alert it's totally to the alert head that before yeah over at Lishavall in uh in Oakland right
804.62,809.8199999999999, I figured they could get a snake somewhere put it in the can they're trying to sell it
812.38,818.3, well just clam chowder so back to Blizzard take us back oh yeah right uh so what else oh so
818.3,823.18, that was Starcraft 2 actually say what tell us about the toilets all about the toilets right
823.18,828.4599999999999, where are my priorities that's gonna tell you about Starcraft 2 my bad it's like showin toe we're like
828.5400000000001,833.82, you should prodding you a lot yeah what else can you learn bring that transform in here again does it
833.82,840.7, right transform well uh number how to transform yeah Robert Ashley is holding one of the
840.7,844.62, one of the world of warcraft comic books if you could see now he's doing one of those modeling
844.62,850.5400000000001, poses and they cannot see now yeah just imagine you know your ideal of what any dumb comic
850.5400000000001,855.1, book looks like and it's basically like that except it has the world of warcraft logo at the top
855.1800000000001,863.02, it's got some sort of generic which is gony looking uh dude with swords on the front i hate that comic
864.3000000000001,870.7, I don't need to I just open it up look I don't get by cover Joe Mad how I think he sucks
870.7,876.3000000000001, but this is like a knock off of him right so imagine if you made it your life's mission to copy
876.3000000000001,881.6600000000001, so he's sucked and then it then you're just like I don't know I mean it's out of context but
881.66,886.38, you're reading it like these a set of work daggers long his swords and sharpest dragons teeth
886.9399999999999,892.3, I choose a druid's weapon this staff carved in the likeness of a stag what about you crock bait
893.02,898.38, rest easy lad things look bleak now but calm will follow the storm is surely his peace will follow war
899.66,903.74, that actually sounds pretty cool I mean I was just about as covered with another you read that it sounds like
903.74,907.8199999999999, I'm sure that's all I guess you're gonna get it now yours take your home
908.7800000000001,914.46, your stuck sounds pretty rare on a book report all right so anyway yeah so the in the
914.46,921.82, men's room at blizzard they have a they have a racks of comic books you know like a magazine rack
921.82,926.3000000000001, with like this week's they have the workcraft comic in there no they didn't actually it was like you
926.3000000000001,930.86, know for all you need to know they they are not taking any offense to what I said about their
930.86,934.3800000000001, fun they had your latest year this week's Batman and all that stuff so
935.26,940.78, interestingly by the urinal not not in the stall they just want to reassure you that there's no
940.78,945.18, fecal matter on the publications yeah I guess so but then you guys I got touched it anyway
945.18,949.5, that everyone's in while in our bathrooms there's this magazine sitting there like I know
949.5,954.86, top of the toilet paper and you're like you're asses already sitting on the toilet seat what's
954.86,961.26, what just take up the comic man or is there take it any filth here I'm at the limit of
961.26,964.86, filth I'm just like I'm on a standard any further I think you gotta go out of your way to get
964.86,969.9, as much filth as possible because you want that barrier of protection you know you gotta like not not
969.9,975.98, not be not be too careful about filth that way you're a protection is zero gallon cowboy had
975.98,983.02, they have in there you could actually use the comic books to sit on in the toilet that would be kind
983.02,987.42, of a way that you're that's living that's living that's the blizzard the face of blizzard that
988.06,992.62, sits well with me you're living to highlight when you line your toilet seat instead of a
992.62,997.66, zero gallon cowboy hat like whatever like a cold-tempo college community college performance take
997.66,1002.54, one instead of that you're using comic books they are living the highlight now I mean they're still
1002.54,1007.42, they're still you know you can tell there's these these people I'm not changed fundamentally
1007.42,1011.98, the people who've been there a long time who they're before I talked to men you know before all
1012.0600000000001,1017.02, this you know we're just wearing capes and crowns now right somebody made the joke early of the
1017.02,1022.46, PR guy coming out in a in one of our meetings today someone made the joke about them guy coming out
1022.46,1030.14, in a liberati out but to greet us you know gold gold let me bathrobe hello hi welcome to blizzard
1030.94,1038.6200000000001, is that liberati I that's my liberati it was kind of a head a little bit of Tim gun
1038.6999999999998,1047.8999999999999, from Bravo wow okay to some you admit you know Tim gun I did before I said like it's been
1047.8999999999999,1051.82, I haven't had cable now for like a year but like a year ago I watched Project Runway this
1051.82,1056.2199999999998, pretty entertaining show shuns like I don't even have cable I don't watch that's to I don't it's
1056.2199999999998,1060.2199999999998, no it's just I don't want to pay for it because I don't watch it enough and like all I watch or you
1060.2199999999998,1066.3799999999999, know bow star and lost and I can watch those on the internet the internet yeah so reminds me of the
1066.38,1073.42, classic onion story star books barista keeps insisting that he doesn't even have a television
1074.22,1078.3000000000002, and it's just about him annoying everyone at work by every time anyone brings up television
1078.3000000000002,1083.9, mentioning the fact that I don't even have a television it's not like that dude I got this red pepper
1083.9,1088.5400000000002, sticker for my cards is till you tell him is yeah there's a lot of that I drive around my heart
1088.5400000000002,1092.7, I spoke parking lot I know yeah there's a lot of kill your television buffers if you're me it's just like
1092.7,1097.66, there's nothing I got comic books laying around a play video games all the time but it's like between
1097.66,1103.66, video games and reading and stuff I don't know you just don't have time for cheaters for me personally
1103.66,1111.26, actually I know that I just sometimes I just try to run them yeah try to run it indeed
1112.94,1116.54, I don't know yet I want to talk about the actual thing you went there for I could talk about
1116.86,1124.54, I could actually talk about starcraft too or not yeah it was pretty fun next next
1125.34,1129.8999999999999, yeah now it was good you know they had it set up you know you could actually play the
1129.8999999999999,1134.22, zerg but you could play all three races yesterday's big deal with zerg so now we've seen all three
1134.22,1140.94, races from the original game it's still pre-alphas they told us eight billion times so you know
1141.02,1149.8200000000002, things are likely to change they will change but we were able to just have one v1 matches or
1149.8200000000002,1156.54, or all the way up to six players and so we all played in different configurations all the races and you know
1156.54,1161.8200000000002, it's already totally holding up even in pre-alpha I mean we had tons of fun clearly there was
1161.8200000000002,1166.8600000000001, shit that was totally imbalanced I mean there was some utter ridiculousness with one of the new units
1166.9399999999998,1172.62, the zerg units which is called the roach which is our people have been talking about online already
1172.62,1179.74, which is this very fast regenerating smaller unit and the earlier parts were that it was replacing
1179.74,1184.4599999999998, the zergling so every we're you know people are speculating on now it's going to be the roach rush
1184.4599999999998,1188.86, because the zerglings are gone the zerglings are still there this is another unit that's like a zergling
1188.86,1193.9799999999998, that has like practically like an instant region thing so you create a bunch of these little
1193.98,1198.7, guys and you could send them at any unit at least at the point it's at now in the pre-alpha
1200.3,1205.18, like yesterday I had a bunch of these guys and I was sending them up against some protest some
1205.18,1211.1, like bigger protest units and they could these big units could not take three roaches down because
1211.1,1215.18, every time they would blast the roaches these things would just come back to life in a second so
1215.18,1220.54, and I was able to whittle down the big unit's biotrition this is the problem also with demonstrating
1220.62,1226.46, RTS is in like quick events like this because there could be there might be some power or another
1226.46,1231.5, unit that's built as a counter to the absolute where you could get them you do something that prevents them
1231.5,1237.8999999999999, from regenerating and it's like even so it's probably it's pre-alpha it's probably like legitimately
1237.8999999999999,1242.94, unbalanced but on top of that whatever balance might be there how many people are going to like get it if
1242.94,1248.3799999999999, it's not just built into the you know if it's not just a carrier we're from there for sure I mean
1248.38,1252.94, and basically they sat us in front of monitors and told us to go and it was sort of up to us to
1252.94,1257.42, learn the units as we did and like building some stuff I mean structures I'm sure you're like okay
1257.42,1262.22, let's just make stuff well exactly I was just clicking on shit randomly and then I and there's no time to
1262.22,1267.66, scheme is so fast pace yeah that you can't sit there and like read the descriptions you know so I was just
1267.66,1272.94, clicking on everything frantically and then sort of seeing what would happen later at the end of the
1272.94,1279.98, day I played a one versus like three computer opponents just so I could like sit there and just
1279.98,1285.98, experiment a little bit and I think I was I think they're so confident in how good the game looks
1285.98,1291.42, and how you know well animated it is that that's really all they needed to communicate it's like
1291.42,1296.3, even when I saw the footage it was like wow this looks really cool the Zerg looks like great the Zerg
1296.3,1301.66, looks so good I mean they're like extra slimy and creepy and gross now it's just stuff that the
1301.8200000000002,1307.66, screen is you know that feeling you get when you you discover an ant invasion in your house or something
1307.66,1312.7, but when rather than the neat tidy little line you see some surface and it's basically just moving
1312.7,1317.3400000000001, and it takes you a second to even realize that it's like basically alive it when the Zerg around screen
1317.3400000000001,1322.38, it has that whole feeling of just like so much movement you can't track every single bit of it just
1322.38,1328.6200000000001, wriggling squiggling good she things exploding in the goo and yeah it had like a really distinct
1328.6999999999998,1332.9399999999998, vibe to it's like this is fun I mean it's like it looked like a mix of take conventions from
1332.9399999999998,1337.8999999999999, aliens and doing and starship troopers and all that you know everything from worms that burrow you know
1337.8999999999999,1344.86, pass through the terrain to just the the meta creatures that metamorphized you know metamorphized
1344.86,1350.62, what's the what's the proper conjugation of that change yeah it's different though that it's
1350.62,1354.62, not because it's not normal change it's specifically related to insect change and they're very
1354.62,1358.9399999999998, clearly inspired by insects I'm not just starting out there because I'm just fancy we're just
1358.9399999999998,1363.02, fucking with you there's a lot more that the time around where it's where some of the units that we're
1363.02,1370.06, used to from starcaf one now evolve into other into other creatures and I'm trying to think of a
1370.06,1375.9799999999998, good example and I'm gonna totally black him out but the big one of course is the queen and that
1375.9799999999998,1380.78, that was the most fundamental change we've seen and as far as I can tell of any of the races is the
1380.78,1386.62, queen is now like central to this entire race which of course is super cool and an insect race right
1386.62,1392.3, I mean it it fits this kind of like queen be thing or you know who's there at the layer sort of
1392.3,1399.02, making shit so she the equivalent of the HQ well no because there is a base she's not a building
1399.02,1405.74, she can move in fact she has the ability to tunnel to tunnel and reappear instantly in any other
1405.98,1411.5, base you have which is awesome because she's basically a defensive unit so any of your bases that are
1411.5,1417.42, in trouble you can just like have her burrow and come up at that basits in trouble and then she can
1417.42,1422.7, like lay some shit on the buildings and stuff that will that will you know it's all about like
1422.7,1427.58, all the stuff that that they're doing with the zerg is is very insect base which is a so need it's like
1427.58,1435.02, all about like infecting shit and diseaseing other units you can disease your enemies buildings
1435.1,1439.74, so that like if you're playing the marines and I bring over the the uh is it the
1439.74,1445.5, corruptor or the investor whatever it's called the bug that will that will do this I can in infect
1445.5,1453.1, your barracks future nader yeah I you basically like vomit the shit onto the barracks and in the
1453.1,1458.3799999999999, barracks for a while are you can't build anything yourself it disables it for you and the marines
1458.3799999999999,1463.42, that come out are like these they're like Jeff Goldblum and the fly there you go test
1463.9,1469.26, and you have a match all of those no you what I do but you don't the zerg does right that's awesome
1469.26,1473.5, yeah these are again from insects we have all these yeah and various forms of like you know
1473.5,1479.1000000000001, parasitism and stuff too yeah um watch this isn't it it's like but you know like there's a typical
1481.5800000000002,1486.14, whatever it is I'm not sure what exactly kind of creature it is but it gets into like a rabbit or
1486.14,1491.1000000000001, our uh uh rodent or something like that and then it causes it to lose all fear of its natural
1491.1,1495.02, predators because basically it's trying to get into a house like a cat or something where then it
1495.02,1501.02, has its like the majority the big phase of its lifestyle but basically parasites that change you know
1501.02,1507.5, the behavior of organisms or that make a certain types of you know insects go up and hang out on
1507.5,1511.26, the tops of leaves where they'd normally be picked up by birds and what they will be picked up
1511.26,1515.4199999999998, fibers you know what is that there's not that the big explanation last year they had a
1515.5,1521.98, conjecture that to explain like the million cat lady syndrome you know people who uh
1521.98,1527.18, end up in apartments with a ton of cats uh they discovered that they're infested with a certain
1527.18,1534.38, parasite that makes them uh that makes their their their senses or their smelling sense like
1534.38,1539.8200000000002, dull to uh to cat urine and in fact maybe they might feel attracted to cat urine really
1539.8999999999999,1547.1, so yeah a crazy cat lady yeah like parasite and the funny thing is did they actually parasite
1547.1,1552.9399999999998, is doing that because it wants it wants the person to be eaten by cats like because it lives
1553.58,1558.46, it lives to get inside of things that die in our eaten by cats so they can go back into cats and
1558.46,1563.5, reproduce because they can only reproduce inside of cats so you say this is but this is no it's for real
1563.5,1568.22, wow okay because I'll say they could just be hypothesizing it but if they've actually like isolated
1568.38,1574.54, if document enough what what then I take it is that this this organism has these traits that are
1574.54,1580.3, adapted for rodents and things like that but somehow it's mutated so that it affects a person yeah
1580.3,1584.8600000000001, I don't see what what it doesn't actually think that the other than just them wanting to take care
1584.8600000000001,1589.58, of the cat somehow I mean I think that's not gonna I mean that will ultimately help the organism if it
1589.58,1595.1000000000001, needs to to be in cats that are well taken care of yeah I mean I think the thing was it feeds and other
1595.1799999999998,1601.1799999999998, animals but it only reproduces and in the cat like it must have evolved along with the cat
1601.1799999999998,1607.26, so if it's organism got like more insidious and smart it could turn us into like a race of crazy
1607.26,1611.34, cat ladies right well there's like rabies is even another type of thing like it's like the
1611.34,1615.02, reason that that rabbit animals lose all inhibitions and want to you know it's fun with the mouth
1615.02,1619.6599999999999, and want to bite you exit want to scratch up the thing is the people who get the pair so they get
1619.6599999999999,1624.9399999999998, it from cat fecal matter so it's not like it's spreading like a flu or something you got to be
1624.94,1629.02, in kind of gross that you're way like it you got to like cats anyway yeah you already got to be kind
1629.02,1636.22, of a cat freak so yeah serious gold to be careful Sean I got one cat do you can shop that
1636.22,1640.14, but my slippery slope there dude I know I did more cat piss in this house
1641.18,1652.3, bring them all over bring them all so yeah so the burger are coming along at swimmingly do they
1652.7,1658.3799999999999, they still basically have the drones which are kind of like stem cells before or just a base
1658.94,1663.18, thing that turned into whatever you want to do yeah so that's still how you build units as you build
1663.18,1667.5, drones that then mutate into other things okay the one thing that that was interesting to me that
1667.5,1673.34, I couldn't it looked like the creep I could be wrong and if I am I apologize but it it looked like
1673.34,1678.7, the creep which if you don't know the Zurg you know has to build on the creep which is you know
1678.7,1684.14, sort of like the you've got vomit to slime that comes out and in the old game that the creep
1684.14,1689.42, naturally spread as you kept building like every new building would sort of you know naturally expand
1689.42,1694.14, the creep and here it looks like it doesn't and you actually use the queen and the overlords to
1694.14,1700.54, to you know they slime the ground basically so yes but I could be wrong about that but that's what
1700.54,1706.14, it looked like but it wouldn't be much of a creep would it it's not really the spray yeah but I
1706.14,1710.3000000000002, definitely was finding myself running out of creep and having to like manually spray the ground
1710.8600000000001,1716.7800000000002, the queen also has the ability to like to put down toxic creep too so that if enemy units even
1716.7800000000002,1720.8600000000001, try to come onto your base they just get damaged just from walking on the creep would just kind of cool
1721.8200000000002,1728.38, so so just I mean it's early on again pre-alpha but they give you anyone even hinted a release
1729.26,1734.7800000000002, oh god no no I mean like the single player didn't even come up this was all just about multiplayer
1734.86,1740.94, sure that they're totally woodshedding on the on the single player yeah for sure but the thing that
1740.94,1746.78, struck me the most and I was thinking about you Sean playing a company of heroes and it would really
1746.78,1754.86, be great to get your impression at some point was even though none of us had really played this before
1754.86,1762.86, for real it was already so fast pace and it was so easy to to get behind and lose to someone who had
1762.9399999999998,1767.74, half an inkling of what to do like for example I played James Melky most of the day and I was playing
1767.74,1773.26, with against him and scooter who used to work for us who's now game tap and also dance table
1773.26,1780.1399999999999, to the PC gamer and James Melky is such a starcraft hoe from the old days that even though we're
1780.1399999999999,1787.8999999999999, looking at mostly all new units his command of the starcraft vocabulary was so huge that his army
1787.9,1793.42, would like gigantic before any of us really had a chance and not just a size you even just the
1793.42,1800.5400000000002, strategy of what to do he had it so nailed already that you know I kept the log of the games that we
1800.5400000000002,1805.8200000000002, played and I was getting wiped out and you know I would last more minutes you know incrementally over time
1805.8200000000002,1810.38, but the first game I lasted like six minutes wow the next game I lasted like 12 minutes that's
1810.38,1815.18, for sure yeah because he put hearts on his match to be over and because we're good to now in
1815.18,1819.1000000000001, company here as we're up to like two hour matches at times right now the last game we played after
1819.1000000000001,1824.6200000000001, say we all lasted about an hour and then we had the quit so this was the early on things you know
1824.6200000000001,1831.42, where you could just get essentially his or gosh like in the old days but but it did cross my mind
1831.42,1836.14, even after I had a better I won't I won't use the word mastery let's say better understanding
1836.14,1844.38, of the game that this this RTS more than others is so fast paced like it's almost like an action game
1844.8600000000001,1849.5800000000002, so what what where's the fast paced coming from is it like we'll clearly the units are are
1849.5800000000002,1854.94, you know rapid deployment they move fast but what about like you know resourcing and stuff do you
1854.94,1860.3000000000002, just gather resources like very quickly there's very likely clearly paced out beginning middle and like
1860.3000000000002,1866.5400000000002, you know in game where you can guarantee that it's going to take you about you know 15 solid minutes of
1866.5400000000002,1871.9, of resourcing before you're able to start feeling absolutely absolutely not like that at all I mean
1872.0600000000002,1876.94, and this goes back to the old game like that's part of the initial the very initial first minute or two
1876.94,1883.1000000000001, strategy is maximizing the drones collecting the resources you know there's only two resources in the
1883.1000000000001,1889.8200000000002, game just like they weren't starcraft one there's just the vespine gas and the held a call the crystals
1889.8200000000002,1895.18, you know and you know you start off with like six drones and you got to put a certain number on the
1895.18,1900.38, levels exact same resources to even everybody that's so you're all sides are fighting over the
1900.38,1905.2600000000002, resource nodes and that's part of your strategy oh they have they have like nodes and yeah how it always
1905.2600000000002,1910.5400000000002, was oh yeah so a part of part of the huge strategy if not the biggest one is he's getting control
1910.5400000000002,1916.46, of those nodes to keep your economy going right you know and fucking the other guys up his access to those
1916.46,1927.5, nodes yeah and you know so right away you're in and the rush is on from the second the game starts
1927.5,1933.1, to get those drones on the on the resources and then start cranking out the units and essentially
1933.1,1938.94, the proper order so that your army is already up I mean this game more than other RTS is feels like
1938.94,1944.86, a race to me did any did anyone in the scoop ever seriously play starcraft on I never played it online
1944.86,1950.94, which is was a whole other universe yeah I'm not playing it like with my friends and that's it
1950.94,1956.46, I did play it on battle I used to play random games on battle and I before they you know the
1956.54,1960.94, hardcore dudes took over was what I want to know is like if if it's traditionally a game that
1960.94,1967.3400000000001, if it still takes a good degree of back and forth or if it's like just just very very like direct rock
1967.3400000000001,1974.14, paper scissors where if one player feels this army he's always going to win against like these other
1974.14,1978.54, units you know oh they he's I mean that's that's that's what I really into like now is just this
1978.54,1981.98, this possibility for where it looks like the games over to the point where your team is ready to
1981.98,1986.3, quit out and then you're like just holding there and you can still buy by fielding your units
1986.3,1991.26, correctly and making their own decisions you could push you know the front line back and forth
1991.26,1995.34, across the entire map I mean right or is it like milky gets in there with that and that's it
1995.34,1999.9, game over it or stuff you could do well that depends on the level players I mean like yesterday you know
1999.9,2006.3, this was like a pro ball player playing you know playing the the little kids you know he just was
2006.3799999999999,2012.3, toying with us but you know Blizzard was saying even yesterday that I mean that with Starcraft 1 even now
2013.18,2017.34, certain strategies keep emerging amongst the pro players that will totally change the game
2017.34,2022.22, someone will figure out a way to use the parents or even one particular Karen unit in a way
2022.22,2026.3, that will change up the games of all the other pro players yeah so that's the other fun part
2026.3,2031.18, about just playing the type of game is like every two weeks it's like I if I could look at my
2031.26,2036.7, play from two weeks ago on the given the same army it's it's significantly different you know you
2036.7,2040.8600000000001, just pick up these little things and then you start prioritizing different tactics units and then
2041.5800000000002,2045.1000000000001, I mean that's why the game is never get all I mean that's right still like it's like a year now
2045.1000000000001,2050.06, I'm going on it's just like co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co because every time I play and I'm getting something else
2050.06,2053.9, out of it and like and then it's like fun then you got some new technique and it's fun to
2053.9,2059.1800000000003, perfect that give it some kind of a name and something and then it's like next week you got something else you
2059.8999999999996,2065.58, well exactly this is why it's ten years on with Starcraft exactly yeah so it's going to be interesting
2065.58,2070.46, and it's going to be really interesting to see like how how all these pro guys adapt to the new game
2071.02,2076.22, you know because I was thinking beforehand before I played it yesterday that well this is cool
2077.18,2082.14, because now that it's Starcraft 2 and there's all this new shit it's going to be like ground zero again
2082.7,2087.18, on battle net and we'll all be able to start over and have equal footing but after playing these guys yesterday
2087.66,2092.54, it was like oh shit no there's no ground zero this is still going to get my ass no matter what
2092.54,2098.46, this goes for every game like even you know it might be like a two days or three days or something
2098.46,2102.22, but like when team portraits too came out it was great you know the first few days you're playing it you're like wow
2102.7799999999997,2108.54, like I've dominating all these people because like that much of a background from TFC help but then it was like
2108.54,2113.74, three days later then you just see it like boom all of a sudden everyone is up to speed or something you know
2113.8199999999997,2118.22, the guys at Blizzard said that themselves they said that what what happens with every new
2118.22,2122.06, game of theirs and they're sure it's going to happen with Starcraft 2 is the first couple days
2122.9399999999996,2127.18, there online playing anonymously you know they're not identifying themselves as closer to
2127.18,2132.2999999999997, place and they're completely kicking ass yeah and it's not even a week before they start losing
2132.9399999999996,2136.22, yeah that happens that's why I want to see when that game comes out I'm going to play it
2136.22,2140.2999999999997, and learn it and I would love I hope to what I don't understand what I don't understand what I don't
2140.38,2144.46, understand is I hear your developers say things like that about competitive games all the time and I
2144.46,2151.5800000000004, wonder when you're designing a game that has a lot a lot of strategy elements and you realize that
2151.5800000000004,2155.7400000000002, there are people in the audience out there that are going to be better than you in a week how do you
2155.7400000000002,2160.78, even design a game to accommodate them like how do you even know how your game plays if they're
2160.78,2164.86, going to be people out there who within a week have discovered things about it that you can
2164.86,2169.58, keep on on the page and you try you have to keep at you and you try to employ those people
2169.58,2174.54, it's easier with the sequel right or if you're like a studio that's made games of a similar type
2174.54,2180.06, because then you picked people who did that with your last game and you hire them and let them play
2180.06,2184.54, and typically like if you're the guy designing we're going to have this type of unit or something
2184.54,2189.58, you really need those people to see just how well it works you know I mean just go in and
2189.58,2193.5, try to exploit it and see you know everything you can do the kind of person like you know
2193.5,2196.62, I mean even when I'm hearing you're talking about the queen can come up this in that place
2196.62,2200.7, they're kind of person who's going to want to say how can I abuse this the the person who
2200.7,2205.66, plays the pro toss is going to say how can I lure the queen up here with one type unit and then
2205.66,2210.06, set this trap where we completely just like you know you pop or with something else as soon as
2210.06,2217.66, she comes up I mean that's the trick you gotta get people latch on to the exploits which are
2217.66,2223.98, like little little things that they missed yeah yeah and they tried to fix them looks great though
2223.98,2228.54, but it was it was very frantic and you know even that thing about the queen it's like even just
2228.54,2233.3399999999997, remembering that she did that you know I would lose a match and then think oh shit I could have
2233.3399999999997,2238.54, saved those bases had I just remembered even user that way I think that's something that just
2238.54,2243.2599999999998, comes with playtime though yeah yeah that's what I was gonna say the more I mean it'll seem to slow
2243.26,2247.98, down and in fact I mean when you get what you get I assume you'll get so good at it that you'll be
2247.98,2252.6200000000003, like able to operate even faster than the game where you're sitting there in your weird
2252.6200000000003,2256.7000000000003, second like what am I gonna do now while I'm waiting for this to get over here this right
2256.7000000000003,2261.26, to happen or something like that and both single player campaigns often do a good job of teaching
2261.26,2266.78, you the value of those units you know they'll have entire missions in a campaign that are
2266.78,2272.6200000000003, basically focused on teaching you what this unit why this unit is cool yeah so right yeah sometimes
2272.62,2276.8599999999997, they the single player campaigns and artists don't get into the like the real nuance you
2276.8599999999997,2280.8599999999997, stuff that does matter and long run they kind of go into the basics like this guy can shoot
2280.8599999999997,2285.3399999999997, air units so you know yeah you want to build him to shoot air units but there's so much more to it
2285.3399999999997,2291.02, right the trick is to just like keep playing and then when you hit this point when you you're
2291.02,2296.54, suddenly feel like you have not total mastery but you feel that you have competence and then
2296.54,2300.38, from that point on it's just crazy I mean it's like then you it's feeling empowered you know
2300.46,2304.3, yeah like you're not the guy who's gonna sit there and bring your team down or guarantee
2304.3,2307.98, to lose when you start a match and you're not and in as it's loading you're not like
2308.62,2312.46, when you're how long it's gonna take this time to lose and you're like I gotta get chance of
2312.46,2317.9, waiting that's that's the hard part about it it's great about RTS is you know against the
2317.9,2322.1400000000003, world at large is it's really easy to get discouraged and it's the assuming you're never gonna get there
2322.1400000000003,2326.54, yeah so like you'll load up a few games you'll try five you'll lose like within you know six
2326.54,2330.2200000000003, six to 12 minutes as you have to and you're just like fuck this and never gonna be this good
2330.2999999999997,2333.74, right and you're abandon it from an FES of course being that you know you're either gonna
2333.74,2336.8599999999997, win or you're gonna lose it's not like you're gonna go and get a few good kills and still
2336.8599999999997,2340.3799999999997, enjoy yourself even though your team you know even though your red team and team for each
2340.3799999999997,2345.4199999999996, or loses like you're gonna win total victory or you're gonna lose absolute you know
2345.4199999999996,2350.06, to check defeat I mean to that you're gonna be at the end yeah and it is I mean it was
2350.06,2354.7, discouraging even in the same yesterday I mean we're joking around and kidding and it didn't count
2354.7799999999997,2360.7, for shit but still seeing milky marching with this humongous army you know I mean it was it was
2360.7,2366.7, laugh out loud funny you know in the first game when he I mean my entire base which I was like
2366.7,2372.14, minorly proud of he destroyed in literally seconds he just came in and it was game over and you know
2372.14,2376.3799999999997, and then I'm sitting there waiting to join another game you know and I'm just thinking like well
2376.3799999999997,2380.7, this is like a little you know foreshadowing of what is gonna be like when this game goes live
2380.7,2386.7799999999997, could the rest of your ally up against him like yeah and we would have let's get a first move
2386.7799999999997,2389.8999999999996, and shit if it was sent them an ally offer and then all three of you should have
2390.2999999999997,2397.18, yeah went for him the the best RTS the the best I ever was at any RTS was it age of empires
2397.18,2401.8199999999997, and that was the only game where I got to the point where that you're talking about Sean and
2401.8199999999997,2407.2599999999998, and the way that I did it at the time so that I was able to actually go online and live was
2407.34,2413.9, I would just play skirmish matches against the AI and and what I would do is I would stop the
2413.9,2419.7400000000002, match after just a few minutes so that I could just see what the computer had built by then and
2419.7400000000002,2425.26, sort of learned from that because it was good AI was good and you know for the longest time it
2425.26,2431.26, would totally you know it would have double my resources and double all these things so even just like
2431.26,2437.1800000000003, a one minute I would stop it very early on just to sort of learn you know how because the opening
2437.1800000000003,2443.6600000000003, gambits are are so important to how how your game is gonna develop so you know if the game's
2443.6600000000003,2450.46, AI is good enough that can be a way to sort of train without getting the personal humiliation of
2450.46,2455.9, other humans that's another big thing in RTS design and it's like you don't want to create
2455.98,2461.5, a slippery slope design is one end of the spectrum you know where you're failing and that's
2462.14,2467.5, that whoever wins in the first five you know minutes of the game is going to win the rest of the
2467.5,2472.06, match because then it's a waste and what happens is people quit out of the game this it wants
2472.06,2476.94, those you know even two minutes even if it's one minute maybe it's go and take control of this one
2476.94,2481.34, point and then if that gives you enough of an advantage on the slope then people just quit out
2481.34,2485.34, the other end is like where it can just constantly go back and forth that's like what you want
2485.34,2491.02, some of that but you want that based on skill not on you know handy capping the person who's ahead
2491.02,2495.1000000000004, and giving this just huge you know advantage to whoever's losing and getting the sweet bottom
2495.1000000000004,2499.9, between there is like just it's gotta be ridiculously hard it's another reason why there's I think
2499.9,2505.42, there's so few RTS that played I mean so many of them seem like they they're all about the the slope you
2505.42,2511.1000000000004, know yeah you get it in the first five minutes and you win or otherwise you lose I don't really play
2511.18,2517.02, RTS has been I'm trying to figure out company of heroes I think the bothers me about about them
2517.02,2523.9, and after played starcraft or you know get it gave it a go it's just the number of possibilities
2523.9,2528.54, and rules like it's not really a simple rule set it's not like playing chess where you can
2528.54,2534.38, get the basic idea of it like so quickly and the and the advanced strategy of it is just sort of
2535.42,2539.98, variations on the the small number of things you can do whereas in an RTS it's like you've got
2540.86,2545.18, billion different kinds of units that can do a billion different kinds of things and if you don't
2545.18,2550.06, really understand all of those rules there's no way you can really take advantage of the game you know
2550.06,2555.66, you can't really start out in that same basic way you know there's approximations and that's like
2555.66,2560.94, when when new players will basically rely on like you can get buying company heroes depending on the
2560.94,2565.98, army you pick with maybe just like three or four types of units I mean I'm sure like if you
2566.46,2570.3, like you know say your pans early and all you're going to do is infantry you're just doing two
2570.3,2575.58, variations those with pans of tricks and those with like you know 44s and basically you do that
2575.58,2581.34, a really good player will up your ass but you can you can play against you know beginning in
2581.34,2585.98, mid-level players and you do that until you're comfortable with them and then you start testing their
2585.98,2590.38, powers you know like their anti-tank grenades and you know they're in senior grenades and then you
2590.38,2595.18, throw in more things to the mix I'm gonna let's do a mortar half track and then I'll put that to
2595.2599999999998,2599.74, all bind that to my second key so that's my second control group and then you just go from there and then
2599.74,2605.1, eventually you feel like you have like absolute you know mastery over every tool in the kit
2605.1,2612.22, but yeah that is I mean that's a huge distinction like you learn a fellow or whatever it is you know
2612.22,2617.5, and it's a learn-in-guargeted by a master and these they can I mean there's the danger
2619.2599999999998,2623.8999999999996, especially when they're like you know don't have war now where there's like nine races and something
2623.9,2627.58, where they just get so bloated and intimidating and I don't even I'm not saying I have an
2627.58,2631.98, play done or so I don't know if it's bloated but it strikes me as I mean when I think of how long
2632.86,2637.42, it's taking me to the point where I feel like now I can play any of the four armies in coming here
2637.42,2644.3, and it's like shit I don't need that many more just you know oh yeah right I mean I always focus on
2644.3,2649.82, one and just go with it for a really long time before even try to dabble on the other ones
2649.82,2654.3, well I know that people were a lot of people are necessarily bombed when Blizzard said they weren't
2654.3,2660.3, adding any new races yeah but now having seen all three and played a little bit of each of them yesterday
2660.3,2664.86, it was like and stark off was a game I played for years it's like well shit I have to learn all these
2664.86,2670.06, all over again so it's really not I mean it is it does feel like enough like plenty
2671.1000000000004,2675.6600000000003, for those of us I mean a lot of people I imagine will be in my position will be their first experience
2675.66,2680.46, with the game you know I mean of course they want us to sell everyone that played starcraft is
2680.46,2684.06, probably gonna pick it up but I mean hopefully they want to sell to a lot more people yeah it's
2684.06,2690.7, how many years later 10 yeah I'm putting a new generation player I played some some free games this
2690.7,2696.46, weekend yep so if I tell you you can grab them all right one of them is called dip rip
2697.18,2705.82, this stands for um diet and pain rest in peace it's a it's a half life source mod and it's
2705.82,2713.42, basically like twisted metal you know a vehicular combat death matching you do team death match
2714.06,2718.38, and the fun thing about it one thing that makes it better than twisted metal and I'll get to
2718.38,2723.58, all the reasons why it's inferior than twist metals that I like just the control set up for it uh
2723.66,2728.46, being able to to use to turn your turret with your mouse and stuff and aim that way you get you know
2728.46,2732.94, mortars that you can law but it's basically like the way the grenades work and stuff and rockets is
2732.94,2738.38, like that's it's pretty cool I like just being able to control it that way although uh this is
2738.38,2742.62, the demo they're they're calling it the demo if the mod it's only got three maps and not all
2742.62,2747.98, the vehicles and weapons in place yet but uh it's got some lag between the input on your turning
2748.06,2753.5, and when it actually does it and that can get a little hairy um and this is a fun kind of game
2753.5,2758.06, we have to fun was telling people in the server as usual you know when the y'all voiced chat that
2758.06,2765.58, dip rip basically was a code for when you flatulate during intercourse you rip when you did
2768.94,2773.02, why not and they were all mad and then that's like change right now too because that explanation
2773.02,2775.82, and a lot of people not join the server they bet that's what it means
2776.46,2786.6200000000003, the game doesn't say it just is dip rip dip rip um and it's pretty fun when you just jump in and
2786.6200000000003,2790.46, play for a little bit but there's something about that kind of game I always even get bored of
2791.26,2795.98, twisted metal after a while like the things that made it and I think the people that made it knew
2795.98,2802.06, that they they was potentially that it was at heart the kind of game that doesn't have the longevity
2802.06,2806.62, of like a golden iron FPS or something like that whatever it is about the car combat it just
2806.62,2810.86, gets older so they threw in the characters you know I mean you want to each of the different cars
2810.86,2815.5, is really different it has some character associated with it that's supposedly driving it you know
2815.5,2820.22, and the theme special attacks and all the other things that they added like the ability to drop
2820.22,2826.94, minds and freeze raise and combos and those uh dip rip kind of lacks those so far but it's still
2827.02,2830.54, how's the stage diversity because the big thing with like twist of metal black was just the
2830.54,2835.82, stage of her huge there's so many like multi-level buildings with all sorts of little secret
2835.82,2839.82, we know that crap you and they got so like ridiculous where you know you're knocking down
2839.82,2844.86, fairs wheels and they're you know running crazy through carnivals and you blow up the
2844.86,2850.3, I felt how or was it twisted metal free and you can use that as a ramp yep into two five
2851.1,2856.7000000000003, I'm actually I was a big twisted metal player she tried dip rip dip rip yeah she's
2856.7,2861.66, checking out I'm a skeptical though of driving with the keep you grew in this name forever
2862.8599999999997,2868.7799999999997, well they named it that one fucking dumb name I just never just never ever I gave it some like meaning
2871.74,2876.22, even what it really made it for it's bothering me dying pain rest in peace yeah
2876.9399999999996,2881.58, why do you have to die in pain then because it's a hard thought that it's been resting
2881.58,2886.7, for me naming a record can't they die in peace too no no but I said I'm not if you're dying at the
2886.7,2892.86, hands of some shooting a rocket on top of a converted um are you I find it I find it hypocritical
2892.86,2897.98, if you're a president in pieces oh it's there you go it's better it's emphasizing it's just
2897.98,2902.22, should straight out a full-manyl jacket it's emphasizing the duality of combat in an
2902.2999999999997,2909.02, main oh you could take my fucking ass
2913.74,2921.02, fell right off it's got dip rip so it's actually pretty fun I recommend that you try it
2922.3799999999997,2926.7, it doesn't hurt it's a pretty quick download I got mine off of all front and then it's other game
2926.7,2932.14, another it's the week of free you know casual games is uh instant action dot com's beta is out
2932.14,2936.8599999999997, no oh right on that's basically like you know uh service where you could play games in your
2936.8599999999997,2940.2999999999997, web browser and they got three new graphics are actually pretty nice you know there's good
2940.2999999999997,2946.22, textures and stuff on it and um there's four games available now everything works really well you know
2946.22,2950.22, you just join in it's it's easiest hell to add friends even find people even if they're not
2950.22,2954.9399999999996, on your friends list to find them and just join their games to make a party jump back and forth
2955.02,2958.94, so it's a perfect kind of and first I recommended to some of my ventrilo crew that we jump
2958.94,2962.86, and play and everyone was incredulous like the fucking smoke and like you just want something to
2962.86,2966.62, talk about for the podcast you know and I was like I actually I had actually been playing at the
2966.62,2971.7400000000002, day before with some other people with zudegranney and um it's like it's it's just fun it's like if you're
2972.38,2976.94, just talking to someone on a message board or whatever like whatever let's just go play some games you know
2976.94,2982.3, so so do the the the graphics and stuff run on the server side then is it not like
2983.1000000000004,2987.7400000000002, using your computer it's like inside of the browser I was wondering about games like that like yeah I don't
2987.7400000000002,2992.78, I don't know it's got to be using your machine it has to yeah thanks to some capacity you know but it's like
2994.0600000000004,2998.78, at the same time I know it'll run to stop about on any you know yeah we're a computer unless you're
2998.78,3003.1800000000003, used I mean that's one of the things that people talk about you know buying this guy ideals like
3003.1800000000003,3008.1400000000003, internet connections being amazing enough to where you just you know run your games off of
3008.14,3013.3399999999997, someone else's killer computer and you're playing in my screen you know yeah yeah yeah yeah but this
3013.3399999999997,3017.74, has got me also really excited to tell you about the the games I played on the servers but it's
3017.74,3023.58, also got me excited for the the quake that's coming out because it is basically making a browser
3023.58,3028.2999999999997, based quake and it looks better than it looks at least as good as quake three like visually and
3028.2999999999997,3032.14, stuff but to again just that kind of game like it's quake three's never gotten old to me
3032.7799999999997,3037.18, the only thing it gets old is like but the people are so good that are still playing it now
3037.18,3043.8199999999997, that it's it's fucking terrible to play against them so that's coming out that'll be cool but
3043.8199999999997,3047.5, you know some of the games on their marble blast online that's been on Xbox Live so people
3047.5,3053.5, that have played there know it's a pretty fun game you know the multiplayer mode you basically
3053.5,3059.02, you know you have these big worlds with ramps and things to jump on in different textures you
3059.02,3063.98, know you can fall off of the worlds and you're all the players and they're racing to collect
3064.7,3069.42, these gems they appear you collect them all then they appear someone else you all go shooting across
3069.42,3074.38, the world using your power ups like you know speed boosts and little gyrocopter abilities or
3075.1,3078.94, a mega marble power that turns you this giant marble and you can slam everyone else out of your
3078.94,3084.62, way or off the world and it's pretty fun just like rolling around I mean the controls are fantastic on it
3084.62,3090.3, and yeah this power where you can just sets off this blast to get stuff out of your way or if
3090.3,3094.2200000000003, you hit someone at full speed with your turbo boost it'll send them like pinballing in the opposite
3094.2200000000003,3099.6600000000003, direction and that's simple but a lot of fun another game on their called think tanks that
3099.6600000000003,3103.26, needs a lot of that needs some more work it's basically you're just these tanks with brains
3104.0600000000004,3107.1000000000004, on top of the turret do you get it think tanks?
3108.1400000000003,3113.98, you get it when you shoot each other to riff off of think tank of all things it's not like
3113.98,3119.5800000000004, video gamers are sitting around you know thinking about the latest research out of Washington
3119.58,3125.5, DC think tanks that it's not like a really popular term or something so when they probably
3125.5,3131.74, had this idea for this generic tank combat game tank combat isn't a tarry combat and they're like
3132.7,3137.18, he's like this idea and we'll green light it but you need a hook it's more a market if
3137.18,3141.74, that's a brain crap or a market if it's a different stuff yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
3141.74,3147.66, a different sounds like some sort of a different sounds like some sort of really crappy like uh
3147.66,3154.06, you know over the counter drug that a teenager would do like some sort of chemical sounds
3154.06,3167.1, like a smack to me like you're gonna do yeah I did you rip with saying that yeah
3167.58,3172.54, uh so the tank the think tank game is kind of like it's deliberately just this kind of like
3172.54,3177.9, lunar gravity tank game where it's just kind of bounce around the world and it's shooting
3177.9,3182.62, each other and it's pretty fun but it needs more and needs more power ups they're all the ones
3182.62,3186.46, that are in there like all far apart and the most fun I've got at that so far is going in with a
3186.46,3191.42, couple friends and no public game and then all green they're just gang up on one person in a
3191.42,3196.14, you know you're sitting just lately because they're saying why and they just to watch them
3196.14,3201.1, eventually give up and you see their tank is just like sitting there where it spawns and then the
3201.1,3207.5, typing comes why are you doing this you're such a dick I can't believe you've done this
3209.5,3216.54, uh so they're a browser so you know I just imagine like some fucking down and out office
3216.54,3220.62, cleric at a job they hate and they're sitting there in the middle of the day they wish they had
3220.62,3225.82, like gone to college to study something that got them into a job that didn't suck and there's
3225.82,3232.86, a new airplane that's fucking stupid tank think tank and like the moment they started up this
3232.86,3241.34, like four assholes going to kill him over and over again and that's how it works because the
3241.34,3246.2200000000003, game is not made where you're able to to fight off multiple tanks it's not like you know
3246.2200000000003,3249.98, Quake or something where you get a rocket or a rail gun and you're faster and you're better
3249.98,3253.58, you're gonna win it's like there's three tanks and you're won you lose every single time
3254.78,3258.6200000000003, but kind of like I did that with Rory and Worms for Xbox Live when I came out we'd make
3258.6200000000003,3263.1800000000003, games and then we'd just like tag team so when we did this this guy was in our game name
3263.1800000000003,3268.46, Waddeeb which is of course like the protagonist from June and so we were telling them about how we had
3268.46,3274.62, the sexual what is it the sexual like powers of a ninth generation dunking gola
3274.62,3278.3, you'd have to read the books to understand what that means he just read past the full
3278.3,3283.9, list the one where that term came from the Dolby swelling yes but as we would team up on him
3283.9,3288.3, and he would just say okay like how do you feel like do you really do you still think you're
3288.3,3297.26, Waddeeb? I don't think so you don't have the word in a way oh man so what about you guys
3297.9,3301.42, and anyway right I'm Rick that's a recommendation too it's what it's pretty fun so far
3302.0600000000004,3307.1000000000004, cool you even think tank here I'm ending dude it's pretty I had fun I mean enough when you're
3307.1000000000004,3310.2200000000003, just like screwing around with some friends and if you're gonna go on this is a lot of
3310.2200000000003,3315.1800000000003, it's the act that's what this is off from that you just put it in instantactia.com right there you are
3315.1800000000003,3318.5400000000004, okay so you know you'll be playing it really like instant like it's gonna be showing up
3319.1000000000004,3323.5800000000004, as soon as you sign up count there's a small low time when you're first getting access to the
3323.58,3328.46, game so that must mean that it's something is stored on your computer but it's not very long
3328.46,3332.62, at all I mean you know it's two or three minutes and then after that it is instant action you
3332.62,3337.02, just press the button and you change game back and forth with one another too like we'll go from
3337.02,3341.42, you know the marble blast online to think tanks and this other one it's like a dump skydiving
3341.42,3346.7, game and it's also an Xbox live that when I asked Zudegranding who's playing with
3347.74,3352.06, if what he thought of it if we should try it and he said he got the Xbox one and then he's convinced
3352.14,3359.18, that CIA is now using it instead of waterboarding so I took that as my that's not
3359.18,3363.66, played this one and yeah so the one I also got that tribes like thing coming out right
3363.66,3367.82, and yeah it was so it's got this like game like tribes coming out and tribes is the old
3369.18,3374.7, PCFES where everyone's got a jetpack and jetpack which well loved great game and it should be yeah
3374.7,3378.7, I mean being able to play that kind of game in the environment should be tribes as way ahead of
3378.7,3383.8999999999996, it's time also to get franchise I saw some really videos of that running in it looked like
3383.8999999999996,3388.62, really really nice that game that you're talking about what's it called the new one what's
3388.62,3393.18, like it's like something a mortal legend it's a ridiculous name it's like nothing to do with tribes
3393.18,3400.14, how do you count on these grassy planes and it's like this kind of cool juxtaposition of these
3400.14,3405.74, fucking robot looking guys like trying to kill each other and all these people in prayer land
3406.22,3411.66, yeah multiple moons hanging in this guy yeah it's kind of nice like compared to you know usually
3411.66,3418.2999999999997, like shooters put you in like you know so hard war world you know like tribes always like that
3418.2999999999997,3423.9799999999996, yeah I never got to play that outdoorsy big huge expanses just be jetpack and around
3423.9799999999996,3430.14, one mountain to get you know this isn't really a game and maybe you guys have tried this up
3430.22,3436.54, but it's it's another free uh diversion I guess you call it a casual game have you heard of free
3436.54,3443.18, rice dot com yes we just and we just that is our magazine in fact well there you go but uh
3443.18,3449.42, if you write the article no okay if you are a but you landed but it's basically the sky who
3449.42,3456.7799999999997, created a this cool okay to call it cool might be a stretch but it's a fun it's a fun if you enjoy
3456.86,3463.98, words sort of vocab game where they give you a word and you match it to one of three other words
3463.98,3468.5400000000004, you and it comes up immediately when you go to the page it's like a quiz and each time you get one
3468.5400000000004,3473.82, of these right and the advertiser on the page uh donates enough money to buy a certain amount of
3473.82,3480.38, rice that goes to the UN World Food Program and it's uh and they've actually created a lot of
3480.38,3485.02, aid through through it because I guess a lot of people are playing it's a hard support and
3485.02,3489.74, peggle where Sally's brother's face pops up on the side of the screen when you get like X number of
3490.94,3497.42, answers right well this was Sally's brother's free no so it's strangely addictive like you're trying
3497.42,3507.42, to sort of be your your your previous best level they could do the at a good vocabulary be good at
3507.42,3511.74, SAT type stuff yeah and it gets down to just basically looking at the word and being like okay I
3511.74,3517.9799999999996, sort of know what part of that word means you know a good bass will help you yeah exactly
3517.9799999999996,3520.9399999999996, your tempted to cheat since you could just like open another browser when you're in go to
3520.9399999999996,3525.58, Mary and Webster.com no I mean that would that would make it like not very interesting if that was
3525.58,3531.2599999999998, be tainted right of that course if you if you do that all you're doing is like helping
3531.2599999999998,3536.9399999999996, somebody get food yeah yeah I mean that's not that that's not the people that's the hook because
3536.94,3543.1, you know no other vocabulary quiz game where you pick you know five choices has ever made me
3543.1,3546.78, want to keep playing but for some reason I'm like is rice appearing in this little bowl over
3546.78,3552.2200000000003, on the side here so we need to need a free rice bot we need people who are playing that
3552.2200000000003,3558.86, help me at winning so that people get more food but I'm interested in this this model I would
3558.86,3564.54, play other casual games that that do that sort of thing but the guy who made it like isn't
3564.54,3569.58, even making any money off of it it's it's not like he donates a certain portion of the
3569.58,3574.14, proceedings he made the game and sort of gave it away and right now it now it just goes to
3574.94,3580.54, right if you are interested it is it was just that it is free rice.com yeah very cool it's
3580.54,3584.38, very cool yeah yeah but otherwise I'm still good about yourself I've been playing a lot of computer
3584.38,3589.66, games actually I think Sean's attempt to convert me into a computer gamer PC gamer has finally
3589.74,3597.1, started really yeah I feel like I finally got a nice video card and started playing various things
3597.1,3603.1, I've been wanting to try for a long time like stalker did you have one of those uh stay up I
3603.1,3607.42, hope you did because I thought oh god you did the podcast listeners last week that you were
3607.42,3614.3799999999997, uh update got back up to finish yeah well it wasn't that I was dying to finish the game it was
3614.3799999999997,3618.14, that I couldn't sleep because if you guys ever had the problem that you know you stay up playing
3618.14,3623.74, a game for a while and somehow the imagery from the game gets sort of burned into your brain yes
3623.74,3629.1, oh and I was trying to sleep like so and I just kept on waking up feeling like I was sitting at
3629.1,3634.22, the keyboard or something and and I finally got up and kept playing which is probably the stupidest
3634.8599999999997,3639.8199999999997, thing you can do if you want to sleep but can't because you're thinking about a game
3640.54,3644.94, but it happened to me with like turn-based strategy game is mostly the time where I'm like yes
3645.1,3650.7000000000003, in an infinite like loop of making moves yes so it's been happening to me as I keep on my
3650.7000000000003,3656.2200000000003, Civ 4 too that's exactly the loop of moves yeah yeah this is the saddest thing because last night
3656.2200000000003,3661.42, I'm not making this up not for the time or anything but like actually last night I woke up
3662.06,3667.66, because I was having like a crummy dream and I was basically playing you know how dreams work right
3667.66,3671.34, so it's like I was playing half life or something in a half life world but it was real
3672.06,3676.38, but it was like also even at the same time that it was real I was aware that it was like a
3676.38,3681.26, shiddly it started to become clear to me that it was a shiddly design level with respawn loops and stuff
3681.26,3686.2200000000003, but it was still real at the same time so I couldn't like ever get out of this area and I was like so I
3686.2200000000003,3689.7400000000002, wasn't making that's the other thing with dreams you know you get these things where you never make progress
3689.7400000000002,3694.46, there's a thing it's like the surface version of a dream or you like you throw a punch and it feels like it's under water
3694.46,3701.1000000000004, I mean that kind of stuff yep so yeah that sadly I think I have a lot of frustrating dreams like that
3701.42,3710.1400000000003, where it's just repetitive elements that bother me a lot or just I mean it's almost like mental illness or something
3710.1400000000003,3714.94, it's like I never have cool dreams or at least I don't remember cool dreams where I do really
3714.94,3720.6200000000003, interesting things or have any sort of insights it's mainly that I'll get stuck in some sort of weird
3721.6600000000003,3726.94, world where something happens over and over and over again you don't get the flying dream oh like the
3727.02,3731.7400000000002, falling dream like flying to get the falling one this time I'm not dreaming this time it's real
3731.7400000000002,3737.82, I really can fly I guys yeah yeah yeah yeah we would virtually hit that one like throughout my whole life
3737.82,3742.2200000000003, about like 40% of my dreams it's just take it for granted but I could swim through the air
3742.2200000000003,3745.7400000000002, so it's not like real flying you do the same exact stuff you would if you're swimming
3745.7400000000002,3751.58, huh but you can get in the air that way it's weird yeah but anyway yeah I've been playing
3751.66,3759.42, I've been playing with a piece of game stalker in particular which is really not really my cup
3759.42,3766.62, of tea because it's so horrific and scary and I'm a total worst when it comes to scary games and
3766.62,3772.86, this game scares the shit out of me did you start getting down into the underground stuff really
3772.86,3776.94, bothers me like last night I got to a point to where I got to another underground thing and I was like
3776.94,3785.18, fuck it I'm playing this during the day seriously I turned it off I agree I got that sophisticated
3785.18,3789.26, with what it does underground I mean like the first you get to the parts where there's like you
3789.26,3794.3, know pulter guys type activity and sounds and stuff but it's like the atmosphere like you feel like
3794.3,3798.94, I loved it as soon as I'm like I can't counting the minutes that I'm down here let me get
3798.94,3802.38, done with what I need to do down here and get back up and even though you're getting back up
3802.46,3807.42, because it's like post Chernobyl wasteland it's like fucking amazing and like peaceful compared to
3807.42,3813.26, being down to the shitty bunkers and it's just really claustrophobic and and you can die really
3813.26,3817.42, quickly I think that's part of real threat of death yeah there's I mean it's just like you
3817.42,3823.58, couldn't fuck up and not react into seconds and die you know and I think what bothers me is that
3823.58,3828.86, the game because it keeps introducing things underground gives you the feeling that you just don't
3828.86,3833.5, know what it is you're gonna find like that that's what bothers me most it's like okay
3833.5,3836.86, it's scared to shit out of me like the last three times have gone down here by throwing some
3836.86,3841.1, weird shit at me you know like I know I'm about to come up on something I haven't seen and I'm
3841.1,3846.06, not gonna know what to do you know that really bothers me but yeah the game is really
3847.5,3854.3, scary but really compelling I found that outdoor stuff to be like way way more interesting than
3854.86,3859.82, the scary stuff mainly because I I want to avoid the scary stuff but I love you know cruising around
3859.82,3864.94, like finding little little camps of bandits and taking them out and looting there there's stuff
3864.94,3870.1400000000003, and just like that famous like you know when the when the review time came I kept talking about
3870.1400000000003,3875.1800000000003, this this one gigantic structure where it's like an old you know warehouse thing or you know it's
3875.1800000000003,3880.0600000000004, production plant and it's like you go out to it and there's really not much at all going on in there
3880.54,3884.46, I mean and we're as most games if they were at ever invest that much time and effort into the
3884.46,3887.98, creating the assets for it they're gonna make sure it's a major point of the game you know
3887.98,3891.1, yeah major level and it's just kind of there and there's just a few people in there but
3891.66,3896.54, like it's just cool I always struck me it's cool makes me I mean I think they really wanted to
3896.54,3901.58, get across the feeling of the Chernobyl exclusion and which I actually visited when I wrote about
3901.58,3907.2599999999998, the game and I preview for games for Windows or for I guess that was GF to or it was computer gaming
3907.34,3914.38, world at the time one version but it's it's really it's really reminding me of of going there that was like
3914.38,3919.5800000000004, one of the craziest things I've ever done in my entire life and and playing the game really like
3919.5800000000004,3925.7400000000002, her mind's me of that you know I mean it was really scary they didn't really explain you know what
3925.7400000000002,3930.2200000000003, what we would be getting into and they told us that we'd be going to Chernobyl I mean we you know
3930.2200000000003,3935.9, pulled up to Chernobyl and a bus like the reactor they're like don't worry guys it's safe as long as
3936.38,3941.6600000000003, we only stay for 30 minutes and meanwhile you know as we're trying to leave after we look at the thing
3942.38,3946.94, you know you've got like all these European journalists like taking pictures of each other in
3946.94,3952.94, front of the thing and I'm standing next to the bus I'm like I can go anytime yeah leave I do not need
3952.94,3957.82, a picture that's even weird too I mean that aspect of the game is like I mean that's the whole
3957.82,3962.54, nature Chernobyl is running fearing the invisible I mean right so but it's like you don't you're
3962.54,3966.14, not gonna feel any different while it's happening you're not gonna hear anything and the guy
3966.14,3970.62, guy down the guy your counter thing is really frightening but it's like it's gotta be just dreadful
3970.62,3974.86, I mean when you know you're like it's not you can't do anything either you can't get in the bus it's
3974.86,3979.98, it's not a bus is made of letter something there is there is one moment on that trip where we drove
3979.98,3985.42, through a place called the Red Forest which is in the game and it's still like the worst site of
3985.42,3990.7, radioactivity in the area besides like you know underneath the sarcophagus because a lot of the
3990.7,3997.18, fallout fell on this forest and turned it red and fucked it all up well like they tell us they're
3997.18,4001.58, telling us about this place as we're driving through it at like 50 miles an hour you know they're like
4001.58,4008.54, this is a very bad place they have a guy you're countered just going you know second I like yeah
4008.54,4015.3399999999997, second I like you guys look like skeletons like on the Simpson yeah oh oh yeah but the game the
4015.9,4021.5, is really has me in its claws and so I've been playing a lot of that I've been just playing a lot
4021.5,4029.02, of games though like kind of annoyingly like I need to have a life like what else do I mean I
4029.02,4034.3, I'm playing like a million different things at once like I've been playing the professor
4034.3,4040.3, late in game I've got the yes that's fun like I was also it's yeah so it's a puzzle game and it's kind
4040.3,4045.98, of you know you play a couple puzzles and you put it down kind of thing yeah and I've been playing
4045.98,4053.7400000000002, Patopon which is pretty cool I bought Patopon yeah yeah it's cool and when it's when you have like a
4053.7400000000002,4058.2200000000003, really fun time with it it's fun but then there's a lot of grinding that I'm getting like annoyed
4058.2200000000003,4063.6600000000003, at because I'll find that I'm not able to consistently defeat certain things in order to
4064.2200000000003,4068.78, to make my guys more powerful it's like yeah I should be the point where I could kill these things
4068.78,4072.46, and get more powerful but basically I have to go back to the food hunting plane
4072.46,4076.6200000000003, when we have three times between each month yeah that's how to get up in the office that gets kind
4076.6200000000003,4083.02, of annoying but then I'm playing smash brothers and I need to get that yeah I'm playing smash
4083.02,4087.7400000000002, yeah if they still have them it's really only in your computer I think it's I think it's
4087.7400000000002,4091.6600000000003, only really worth playing if you're going to play with people right online you play with all that
4091.6600000000003,4097.1, online like play games play play in person I mean I I don't I don't it's a that's a couch game
4097.18,4103.740000000001, coming over to my house to play smash brothers so yeah yeah but it's that's that's cool too
4103.740000000001,4109.58, and then I've been playing a bunch of the in-plus for Xbox the the version of that free flash game
4109.58,4115.9800000000005, that that uh it came out on Xbox I did you guys know that the yeah I heard about it yeah
4115.9800000000005,4120.3, that ninja plus for whatever but that's that little like stick figure yeah it's like it's like this
4120.3,4125.9800000000005, crazy like like it's probably the most hard core platforming game of all time I mean it's
4126.0599999999995,4132.219999999999, you you have to be basically an ninja in order to get past some of the levels because it's like
4133.5,4138.299999999999, the most daunting obstacles you've ever seen in a game even though it's you know really simplified
4138.299999999999,4144.459999999999, or this tiny guy and and a screen full of enemies that are you know basically like dots or red dots
4144.459999999999,4150.219999999999, or I mean there there's nothing to them but but uh the the physics of jumping in the game
4150.54,4155.5, are really compelling and uh and you basically each one of these tiny levels have to figure out a
4155.5,4160.780000000001, pat a sort of flight path through all the obstacles and you'll try it over and over and over again
4160.780000000001,4164.9400000000005, I mean there are certain levels where you can go and like find people talking about them online
4164.9400000000005,4169.900000000001, because they're just so notoriously painful you know it'll take you an hour of trying it over and
4169.900000000001,4174.9400000000005, over and over again and looking at YouTube videos to find strategies instead of it. It's probably
4174.94,4180.78, still playing it's totally masochistic but I've got I've got this I've got a real like
4180.78,4185.98, perfectionist masochistic kind of streak in me when it comes to games that uh that a certain
4185.98,4191.9, games will really like tweak that and I'll just feel the need to beat something that seems
4191.9,4196.86, incredibly hard did you love all this like love wasn't the original Mega Man or like the
4196.86,4202.62, platform is what's facing and out there never be more than one on screen I think love is a little
4202.7,4208.54, strong I think I'd probably hate them but I definitely played them and played them and played them
4208.54,4213.099999999999, and so I could do it you know well there's that whole genre of platform which is memory I
4213.099999999999,4217.82, memorizing the patterns of thinking originally yeah the goals and ghost games and stuff are like
4217.82,4222.3, that too where you just gotta remember to jump this way then jump right back that way but not there
4222.3,4227.0199999999995, is there's some there's some reward in games like that you know you feel like you you learn this
4227.9800000000005,4233.660000000001, this process and then when you perfectly execute the process you're like oh I did it you know
4233.660000000001,4239.820000000001, it feels like a real move abstraction for like playing a song or something you know no it's kind of yeah
4239.820000000001,4248.38, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah well and it's also in the same way that playing something
4248.38,4252.860000000001, over and over again it becomes kind of second nature because you're not dealing with anything like
4253.259999999999,4257.5, variable you're just seeing the same thing over and over again so all you have to do is
4257.5,4261.9, get your muscle memory to work you know get your hands to move and just the right way you know
4261.9,4267.179999999999, wasn't the situation of any platformer I mean the marios are like this yeah even games like
4267.179999999999,4272.7, Prince of Persia are like this where it's basically trial and error you know figuring out finding
4272.7,4279.9, where the traps are yeah it memorizes oh yeah there's some games some games telegraph and
4279.9,4284.86, well enough or like give you enough clues that you know what moves you have and you can get by
4284.86,4289.98, the trap just by kind of seeing it coming and I would also say a game like super mario
4289.98,4295.74, brothers has enough uh a different approaches to any particular moment you know like just the original
4295.74,4301.0199999999995, super mario brothers you can get past any of those obstacles in a lot of different ways it's not like
4301.82,4306.379999999999, and I'm sure that in and plus they're a million different ways to get past these things but
4306.46,4312.3, you it's so difficult and so crazy that you basically define your routine and you have to do
4312.3,4316.3, that routine where as in super mario brothers you really can if you're halfway decent just sort of
4316.3,4321.5, flip by you know jump on things make decisions on the fly you know it can be good for game cube
4321.5,4326.38, got that way uh it's just tons and tons of games you can pick from from any genre the old school
4326.38,4332.06, game is where it was just you know pattern recognition any shooter shoot him up yeah your description
4332.22,4337.740000000001, just told you giving me a jump man junior vibes from my commenter 64 oh never played a
4337.740000000001,4343.580000000001, man junior any commenter 64 games but what was what was jump man junior I mean it and probably
4343.580000000001,4347.5, has a lot to do with the fact that it looked a lot like this game making it a little pixelad guy
4347.5,4353.900000000001, and you had a one screen universe with ladders and these specific little I don't know circles
4353.900000000001,4359.900000000001, you had to pick up so it was just a matter of learning when to jump when the when your platform is
4359.9,4364.54, gonna be in the right position you know yeah this is a little screen crazy performers I do
4364.54,4369.82, I do like those kind of single screen games and especially when they're so abstract it reminds me of
4369.82,4375.259999999999, being a kid and sitting there with a piece of notebook paper and like drawing out a war
4376.0599999999995,4380.54, you know you guys ever do that like you just sit there and you create this like battle scene
4380.54,4385.259999999999, and it was like as you were drawing it the things were unfolding you know like we draw lines
4385.900000000001,4390.06, friends too like in school you pass a valley fourth yeah yeah yeah maybe mutual I'll say if you
4390.06,4395.5, like that kind of abstraction play Vetterex games without the the plastic sheet stuck up on the screen
4396.3,4399.9800000000005, you know because it was just vector cramp yeah yeah yeah yeah so anyone that when you're talking
4399.9800000000005,4404.780000000001, about that game did as anyone else played minor to a 49er no the go vision
4406.780000000001,4413.02, that's not I sounds funny that that was one of the that was one of the first games I really really loved
4413.1,4416.780000000001, yet a colleague of the game I played plenty of games before that yeah I mean I had it stuff
4416.780000000001,4422.38, from the Odyssey on but that was one of the first games were I just played over and over and over and over again
4422.38,4426.38, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that colleague oh man had the number buttons although you know back in the
4426.38,4430.14, day I feel like I mostly played games over and over and over again because that was like the only thing
4430.14,4435.42, I had you know you'd have a game and you just this is your game for Christmas yeah better like it
4435.9800000000005,4441.5, you know because there was no game rental none of this there's trainer now kids get like game fly
4441.58,4446.94, it just comes to your house like that's right with your friends yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
4446.94,4453.98, I was the main tanner of the um neighborhood game library we had a big document on my Commodore
4453.98,4457.9, that's wow I would print out a man made cut to copy that yeah I would print out uh
4457.9,4462.78, doctor X copies of the entire list to the you know for the neighborhood kids and like we would
4462.78,4467.26, all rate them and give them star ratings really yeah yeah well that's holy shit wow I wish that I
4467.26,4473.26, lived in your neighborhood realize that like that's what I do now I'll see yeah oh kids kids my
4473.26,4484.54, neighborhood we're not down with the trades of games not into it not at all not at all I mean
4484.54,4489.9800000000005, well there is like one kid who you know the sort of archetypal rich kid who had a million
4489.9800000000005,4495.18, games like to the point where he'd like lose Nintendo games who loses Nintendo games you're like
4495.18,4499.18, eight years old or ten years old you know and people would sort of come over to his house and play
4499.820000000001,4505.1, and and and and beg to borrow games but otherwise everyone else was kind of you know you had
4505.1,4510.14, your super Mario Brothers did he lend him what was the greedy about his greedy and Andy had a
4510.14,4515.5, geodjo aircraft carrier that's always that's what you really fat out the you know he wasn't
4515.5,4521.900000000001, and he and as he got older he was you know a likable and popular guy oh I hate dated like good
4521.9,4528.139999999999, looking women well he got his come up at the end of that right no people don't that's coming
4528.139999999999,4534.219999999999, damn it yeah he's talking about it by the end that's that's such a fictional far the most the greatest
4534.219999999999,4541.74, extent of his come up and so you got de-bripped you're gonna let's go back to that aircraft carrier
4541.74,4550.78, the flag that was like the toy that was made like for my generation the hell was that that was my
4551.34,4556.94, phone that like a Tomagachi from my generation that was the that was the signifier of who
4556.94,4560.78, rich you know like it was I was convinced it was made for that kid you're talking about it
4560.78,4566.54, in my case I knew the kid you had it and it was like that's the one yeah go to his house swim
4566.54,4571.66, his pool enjoys jacuzzi and see what you know play the slot machines in the living room
4571.66,4577.259999999999, hang on the fireplace look at his go he's got their craft carrier I'd rest in it I think there's
4577.26,4582.62, one even better so if I saw eggs in our apartment complex and that that's that's a go-court
4582.62,4588.54, that was the ultimate thing for me when I was happy to know you wrote a go-court yeah oh man
4588.54,4592.62, oh I knew at least two or three people would go I mean I guess maybe this is the Texas
4592.62,4597.74, thing because we had fields okay you could suburban buffalo does not have much go with the three
4597.74,4604.62, wheeler era yeah it was like the guy there's saying you're just hit a pot roll hold just wrong
4604.62,4611.98, you break your fucking neck yeah yeah that's the concern say that uh yeah kids rich kids I'm
4611.98,4615.98, gonna talk about some more they run the world more of those toys like that what else is there
4617.18,4623.099999999999, right it's your turn hey I'll also a hold on PCs for for playing games that's the other thing
4623.099999999999,4628.78, that's why I didn't have a PC at all they're my first PC when I was in graduate school like
4628.78,4633.82, even undergrad I had to go the fucking library like and so I never played but I would now and then
4633.82,4638.38, I'd have a friend who would have one yeah a computer or like I mean in an elementary school you
4638.38,4642.86, know like they had like an apple two but yeah that that was mysterious seeing people playing
4642.86,4649.179999999999, computer games um holy shit or the first like you know apple with a mouse might save the same
4649.179999999999,4654.7, friend that had the the carrier they had one remember playing some like game where you're like a
4654.7,4657.42, little knight or something you throw rocks at shit
4657.42,4682.14, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah anyway we we do not spike the rich not we don't we love the rich yeah
4682.14,4689.26, okay thanks we're gonna take a break we're gonna take a break
4692.06,4697.26, listen to EGM live the weekly podcast for electronic gaming monthly available every
4697.26,4703.900000000001, Monday for download at EGM live dot one up dot com or podcasts dot one up dot com or the iTunes music
4704.139999999999,4714.46, like a we're back uh during our break here uh Robert Ashley was explaining uh uh how the
4714.46,4719.66, game industry works to us and he had a term for it actually it was no no I was about why we're not
4719.66,4724.299999999999, gonna talk about smash brothers that well that's what it was a reason we're gonna talk about
4724.299999999999,4728.299999999999, smash brothers was people were already covering it a lot but but then I was saying that everyone's
4728.299999999999,4733.099999999999, got the game and now they're no longer stoking their game boner and
4734.219999999999,4738.219999999999, and I just I what what I was saying is and then this is something I have to give credits my friend
4738.219999999999,4743.42, will see sort of invented this term game boner but there's a certain um thing that happens to a
4743.42,4748.46, young man when he sets his eyes on a game that he really wants to play that that's far in the distance
4749.5,4754.379999999999, and and the only thing he can do about that that game lust is to look at um screenshots
4755.0199999999995,4761.42, and badly written previews uh and dissect uh every every detail of gameplay and talk about it on
4761.5,4767.74, reading interviews about uh yeah and but you know actors make avatars out of uh
4767.74,4772.22, photophagre chart stuff but basically I was just saying that you know this whole thing that whole
4772.22,4778.14, reason that that you are listening to this podcast dear listener or reading one up is that
4778.14,4782.9400000000005, everyone gets a game boner now and then and you just got a normal it's true yeah you snap it
4782.9400000000005,4788.38, yeah go with and we exist to fulfill that need we're kind of the the game boner
4789.02,4794.7, we're changing professional enthusiasm yes with with skateboarder and stoker yeah
4795.9800000000005,4800.86, and also the plies when you're at a game store have you ever been like day one to a video game store
4800.86,4806.14, you know where it's a big release day and you know there's gonna be a bunch of nerds out looking
4806.14,4812.14, for a game like so you go to target and you see this guy like standing by the by the glass case
4812.14,4815.82, and he's looking around he looks at you and he's like looking for the guy to show up and he's
4815.82,4820.139999999999, sort of impatient and he can just tell that he's there to get the game and you're like yeah
4820.139999999999,4826.139999999999, that's when you know that guy has got a massive reaction and he's all been a guy we know I've all
4826.139999999999,4830.46, I've that I mean because you're there yet that game like I remember the when I was looking for
4830.46,4836.38, the original guitar hero when it came out and I went all over town and I got to an eb games and
4836.38,4841.42, there was a guy in there who's pacing around while someone was looking in the back and I was like
4841.42,4848.06, so are you looking for a guitar hero yeah I mean it's it was a moment so basically you
4848.06,4852.86, could have the system bone or two right then well you could like for the Wii yeah yeah and there's
4852.86,4856.54, like circus too they're equivalent of a surrogate when you have a game bone or for one game but
4856.54,4860.78, then it's like the late or it's not out or you don't get it for one reason so you get something else
4860.78,4866.9400000000005, so yeah these like you have surrogates yeah I have a particular disorder where I like I convince
4866.9400000000005,4871.34, myself I guess that I don't really care and then the day the thing comes out all of a sudden
4871.34,4877.5, all of my stuff like the camera's feeling totally fucked actually a pre-order thing
4877.5,4881.900000000001, yeah I'm like going from store to store to store no one's got it they're not doing
4881.900000000001,4887.18, did you pre-order it and like no I didn't think I wanted it like too bad I think I'm gonna
4887.18,4891.18, have that with grand theft auto actually like I've been avoiding like looking forward to
4891.18,4894.7, that game but the day it comes out I know I'm gonna wake up me like oh my god I'm gonna get the
4894.7,4899.66, game well part of the problem too well especially if you like are around people like us who
4899.66,4903.26, were doing this all day for a living it's like like that's what smashed brothers like I didn't
4903.26,4906.38, get it and that's all everyone's talking about it and the building and I'm just like I have to
4906.38,4910.94, fucking get this now Pat upon was the same thing yeah there were like three days around here where
4910.94,4915.5, all of you guys were like Pat that Pat that Pat that upon but that's what I wanted to talk about
4915.5,4919.98, yeah we were not very loved it yeah you just hear people doing that I know but I wanted you

4949.42,4956.22, smash brothers woodman wait I thought we weren't gonna talk about smash yeah the end of talking
4956.22,4959.9, about well let's talk about now let's find because the next thing I got is sad
4960.54,4965.9, oh really well it's like a news item sad one but this is this is kind of depressing is right but
4965.9,4971.42, this is it about so right would you say let's hear would you say we are you smash brothers with
4972.46,4976.38, come on explain what woodman means you can kind of someone I can keep their game
4976.38,4981.42, bone or stoke or indefinitely you have my aggrave for your game bone or you
4982.7,4989.58, I'm just gonna go ahead and tell us this whole thing that is wise very very well done Ryan well
4989.58,4995.9800000000005, handled nice what do you got there Sean okay so piracy's been coming up often on on the show
4995.9800000000005,5001.26, as it is it will when you're dealing with PC games um then during GDC week we were talking
5001.26,5005.42, about it with some of the developers that we had guessing on our show and there's always it always
5005.74,5010.06, leads to these spirited you know message board discussions where some some people say
5010.78,5015.58, this is people are blowing at a proportion it's insane it's like these are just excuses you know
5015.58,5020.7, these are developers are whoever making excuses for their game just not being that good in the first place
5022.06,5030.38, but Kotaku put a story up a that tracked PC gaming piracy on a single torrent site for a
5030.38,5035.1, single day and provide some of the figures and I think they're pretty revealing especially you
5035.18,5039.34, might want to think twice if you're if you're the camp where you think that piracy actually isn't
5039.34,5045.34, happening um I don't know they extend to which it's it's preventing this an argument that no one's
5045.34,5049.9800000000005, gonna win or to extend to which it's actually preventing people from buying the games I don't know
5049.9800000000005,5062.38," but so on mini nova which is a torrent site in one day um there were 25,734 downloads of a"
5062.38,5068.22, Assassin's Creed for PC you know mind you that game is not out this is a preview code that got
5068.22,5075.42," leaked or something along those lines um the same day front lines fuel a war there were 12,688"
5075.42,5080.86, and again keep in mind not only this is a single day but it's just this one site it's not like yet
5080.86,5087.42, it's not like everyone does their their torrenting on mini nova or whatever um so even now
5087.42,5095.18," call duty 4 modern combat that day was 8,792 um i mean going back to what some of the people"
5095.18,5099.5, from call duty 4 when they were complaining about piracy said that assuming that the rate of download
5099.5,5105.5, is now constant across uh those whole three in a in a bit months which is incredibly since the
5105.5,5109.9800000000005, game was released which is incredibly conservative so you know he's assuming that during the first
5109.9800000000005,5117.26," couple weeks at the first month there are a lot more than like 9,000 a day um that means 990"
5117.26,5123.26," 3,496 copies will have been illegally downloaded via mini nova alone so basically a million"
5123.26,5128.54, at that rate just for the PC right there so other stuff on here i mean even even the smaller
5128.54,5136.14," figures like turning point fall liberty just came out that's you know 5,200 or so um and even old"
5136.14,5144.14, games you know like age of empires uh 1100 on that day so it's definitely people are ripping
5144.22,5150.22, shit off this was worldwide numbers no this is a day on mini nova okay which is people can
5150.22,5153.740000000001, access the sun for many where so yeah it's not like they're they're just oh and are how many people
5153.740000000001,5158.06, out there right now are like mini nova okay i'm gonna go get me call and do they should have
5158.06,5162.38, been right now no hope that's how come on i mean if you're if you're out to see yeah if you're
5162.38,5168.22, just doing know yeah i feel you know i i was wondering about piracy when i when i went to the
5168.3,5173.5, store to buy a copy of crisis the other day which i've never this is the first time i think i've
5173.5,5180.62, ever like went out and purchased a uh a PC game because i mainly play on steam and so i go out
5180.62,5186.22, and i look for it eb games and i can't i'm looking through their junkie pc shell which looks like
5186.22,5191.42, you know like a porn rack or something it is like it's all it's all like turn to the side you can
5191.42,5195.740000000001, even tell what's on there and i'm looking for the game and i can't find it and finally i'm like
5195.74,5204.54, do you guys have crisis he's like got to sit at blank look on his face he goes oh oh like the
5204.54,5208.7, computer game yeah let me get a look and they goes and like finds a copy in the back
5209.34,5213.74, but it was like it was like i was buying something that was unheard of and i like they
5213.74,5220.139999999999, you know like that must be the only time you saw like an in store promo or anything yeah i don't
5221.1,5226.38, i can't find those those post a fix all that well never an eb i mean they they made their deals with
5226.38,5231.740000000001, different companies well wasn't circuit city one circuit city was one of them circuit city just
5231.740000000001,5236.06, liquidated all of its pc games they're not going to sell them at all anymore circuit cities and
5236.06,5241.02, trouble yeah they had that massive sale though where people were picking up like all like some
5241.02,5245.740000000001, really cool games between ten and two dollars and ten dollars yeah was that circuit city or a computer
5246.7,5252.219999999999, no i'm not sure if they took it to the art we're service the state of the art oh thank yeah
5253.42,5258.78, i guess but they this week's advertising man so okay that is exciting well that's some
5258.78,5263.42, sadness of course all those people are going to go out and buy those games but i mean that that's
5263.42,5267.179999999999, some serious numbers that means a lot of people because these other games are like a sentence
5267.179999999999,5272.54, created on pc that takes a fucking lot of computer run so if this many people are you know
5273.42,5278.7, like getting these games is good it stands to reason that quite a few people out there have good
5278.7,5283.18, machines and it's not just that people aren't buying the games because they don't have machines to run them
5284.06,5289.34, it's also fun we're that you that you would spend you know over a thousand dollars on a computer and then
5289.34,5295.58, be a cheap ass about buying games it's weird yeah right that's how they win the console wars
5295.58,5300.14, are yes about which platform is better well it may cost a couple thousand bucks but then all the
5300.14,5305.5, games are free for life wow maybe i don't know yeah i'm sure there's people that say that
5306.22,5311.820000000001, if you are one of those people and you're listening now fuck you from from us to you
5311.820000000001,5318.14, did they talk to we console like disc images on that so i'm sure they do yeah a story
5318.14,5323.660000000001, we're hearing it's talking to the list of those but uh the less there's a possibility that
5323.660000000001,5328.62, it's mixed up in here i don't know there's it doesn't list it is being but a few things make
5328.62,5335.58, me think so um that's at the orange boxes on there but i guess that that they did sell a version of
5335.58,5340.3, it in stores you know so yeah that's how but i thought you have to use steam to validate
5340.3,5344.54, they found a way to yeah that's the use they can find so you can find ways for everything
5344.54,5351.0199999999995, but i mean at least stuff seems to be moving to these downloadable options which add a lot
5351.0199999999995,5357.099999999999, to this is like the top 10 for PC this is the same as the video version instead of like hearing
5357.18,5362.620000000001, about rights and and work out every month here's like a right other look at like top 10
5362.620000000001,5366.700000000001, in desire building this is how we'll put a positive spin on it and all these games it's like yeah
5366.700000000001,5371.42, like the Witcher and bio-shocking crisis they should start with brackets and hellgain and real
5371.42,5377.5, game but it's gonna be more than any other game this week they can start using that to sell
5377.5,5383.26, for cred time for cred yeah number one most pirate in game in march mega new excel mode of the
5383.34,5389.18, right what is it like it's the he wants to fuss is all about download illegally for today
5390.38,5394.780000000001, if only says all these interns we should just have some interns that just look up numbers like that
5394.780000000001,5399.66, all day you know yeah find these little like projects this school that we need them like biosanologist
5399.66,5401.5, and shit
5402.54,5407.9800000000005, it's coffee right now actually yeah me too i mean i i think stuff like that's really that's a really
5407.9800000000005,5413.02, interesting story that's cool yeah totally I did that yeah cool good on them big up
5413.660000000001,5419.660000000001, to Kataku very sad though yeah it's been a happy story but there's another story you know
5419.660000000001,5426.3, it doesn't even have a sutra where this one developer they had figured it out that 92% of
5427.26,5433.26, the people playing their game had had a pirate at it my god it was for this kind of like a casual game
5433.26,5440.700000000001, you know 92 imagine that 92% of the people paid out of them some donations do you like do like
5440.7,5447.5, radio ahead man yeah really really hard way about fucking human generosity you just can't
5447.5,5453.099999999999, you can't blame the developers and who bail out and cite this reason you just can't yeah
5454.139999999999,5458.54, at least they can take solace in the fact that people are playing their thing yeah
5458.54,5463.74, like at least people are enjoying my art yeah well my guess more more people are just going
5463.74,5468.86, to have to move to some kind of you know subscription model or something yeah that's why everyone's
5468.86,5473.5, afraid that's all going to mMO's mMO's and free battlefield heroes kind of things I was just
5473.5,5479.099999999999, sitting here thinking where was I reading this but it was a kimlvine interview in in your magazine
5479.74,5485.0199999999995, such a good magazine yeah that's a great magazine no but I think he he made this point when
5485.0199999999995,5491.82, when he was talking about you know all these AAA big PC games falling flat in their faces this year
5491.82,5498.299999999999, with with sales that that okay so these guys leave the market and it just opens up the
5498.3,5502.9400000000005, sort of wild west of of gaming which is interesting I mean it's cool that it's not it's not
5502.9400000000005,5508.62, it's cool maybe it's having like everyone making great games for PC from from these well known
5508.62,5513.34, developers but I mean it is interesting to see what's going to happen it's not like gaming is
5513.34,5520.22, going to disappear from the PC you know everyone's got a PC it's going to have games better
5520.22,5525.5, we're going to have to change this podcast name yeah to the brodia or whatever games for whatever
5526.46,5534.06, games for fun games for screens official games for screens magazine screens for games
5534.06,5538.38, yeah cover this you don't I guess that's a screen yeah this picture of it
5539.5,5545.5, screens and scores capture those dinosaurs this romp and stomp a dinosaurs it's the dinosaur
5545.5,5552.46, shift we already are you mad that that occupies real estate in your brain like whenever I
5552.46,5559.5, didn't take very much it's a very very well oh it doesn't take up much John's got a space in there
5559.5,5564.86, we don't play big bringing the games right he's how the mind is how the mind works yeah you zip up these
5564.86,5568.7, files but though it does it is you know we're having this conversation we're out of drinks
5568.7,5573.18, well back yeah and I was talking I pointed out the stain on the table and I told you you wouldn't
5573.18,5577.18, remember it unless I pointed it out because basically you'd fill up the quill if you if you look at the
5577.820000000001,5582.3, the computational analogy for for human cognition and that's got to tone you know shortcomings
5582.3,5587.02, and stuff but you basically fill up your drive with every bit of information like when you're walking
5587.02,5592.22, down the street and every bit of sand and piece of gum on the sidewalk and stuff so it's like
5592.22,5597.02, I think that song should be down there with like one of the grains of sand but it's just
5597.02,5603.18, the reason it's for smart so that it's not deleted because deep down inside you think that's a
5603.18,5607.900000000001, damn catchy song and you like it I like it man I think it's you just bumped it back up at the top
5607.900000000001,5616.14, you're going to right I downloaded the the YouTube ad what you to bad this is like chef where
5616.14,5622.9400000000005, he dinosaur I love this is why I love YouTube not every child not every damn damn close I couldn't
5622.9400000000005,5627.02, find they didn't have the 12 inch mystery because I went to check the fidelity of my memory when I
5627.02,5630.22, was talking about some of his old jingles and there was something that weren't on there like
5630.3,5635.18, Mr. T the 12 inch would they have another version but that's not to be confused with 12 inch doll
5635.740000000001,5641.02, that it's own ad they didn't have like gremlins cereal I could find gejo action stars
5641.58,5648.22, while I could find um ice cream jiu ice cream jiu and cereal I couldn't find fruit island
5649.1,5655.740000000001, fruit island with the king and yama yama oh I remember that no wait yeah that oh yama yama
5656.46,5662.0599999999995, the things that they tried to feed us in a year to wait that's a material fruit island
5662.0599999999995,5668.86, yeah new fruit style action they had um I was talking about the now you're cooking
5668.86,5673.58, it's like transforming because you know like boys in that time they had all these cool transforming
5673.58,5678.38, toys and go mods and stuff so the girls they tried to hook them up with the usual like you know
5678.38,5684.0599999999995, domesticity so they gave like cooking utensils that would transform the double duty they did was
5684.14,5688.780000000001, so fucking pathetic that I was like in my memory I was like I remember the grossing the taco
5688.780000000001,5694.9400000000005, holder is a tray and I was like this this has to be some fault of my memory because a taco holder
5694.9400000000005,5701.02, how how different is that from a tray right but I found the commercial and in the day they are
5701.02,5706.620000000001, different because the taco holder also becomes a tray they should have taught them a better lesson
5706.620000000001,5711.740000000001, and had like the utensils turn into like lingerie or something because that would be like
5712.219999999999,5717.98, kitchen and the bedroom thing you know get them brainwashed early um Barbie's got that cover show
5717.98,5722.219999999999, because Barbie comes with like you know you can get her own yeah cooking stuff right and like
5722.219999999999,5727.42, miniature garbage all make it they also have this like skanked out the tramped out ones
5728.46,5733.66, the brats you're the you're the father of a of a of a girl so I am uh you had to deal with the

5771.9800000000005,5777.820000000001, that all the cereals that I liked in my youth now have the ones that still exist like they all had
5777.820000000001,5783.9800000000005, sugar in the name when I liked them sugar pops sugar pops mac sugar smacks sugar smacks sugar frosted flakes
5783.9800000000005,5789.1, yeah every so good yeah I remember when they started removing them too because wait what are sugar pops
5789.1,5795.18, now corn pops yeah gotta have my corn pops like as if sugar specs are the smacks max
5796.14,5802.3, think of that smack dude right sugar crisp is gold off of corn pop at the sense those two
5802.3,5806.780000000001, were sick of the sense that's terrible to me what popcorns different corn pops sounds nasty
5808.06,5812.780000000001, sugar pops and a good and sugar frosted flakes also the shit still has all the sugar in it
5812.780000000001,5818.780000000001, no now it's not like it's corn syrup they they kind of want sugar no super for you kids you
5818.78,5823.58, remember that that in cities I love love double double checks you expected that I learned
5823.58,5831.42, that I remember that we're good what about that burger king shit huh there was there
5831.42,5837.259999999999, many many good burger king ones there was like how how you order the the two all be paddies one that one
5837.259999999999,5842.46, special sauce for the two all make a lot of fun and stuff yeah yeah that's a very
5842.46,5853.66, cool thing it's a burger king question which that's a regional one or something but yeah
5853.66,5859.34, oh I guess I can't eat that shit it's more in the middle of the day then the day that
5860.22,5865.9800000000005, remember we were all the two print magazines were on deadline it was cgdb rgfw and the egia
5865.98,5871.259999999999, the christian which no and yeah she said hey since we're all we're all on deadline and you know
5871.259999999999,5875.9, I know you guys were all working hard I'm bringing in breakfast and then it was McDonald's breakfast
5876.62,5882.78, I was like this is like for that how old are you yeah what you're bringing food for like a group of
5882.78,5887.58, ten year olds you think you were get blizzard yeah we're like in Sanford big enough there's like
5887.58,5892.78, twenty bagel shops in a two block radius he's bringing in egg McMuffins I shouldn't be complaining
5892.78,5899.0199999999995, about my boss on on national public radio here but this is the
5899.0199999999995,5903.259999999999, other this is an NPR why didn't mean that with capital letters okay
5904.3,5911.58, and it's not even radio being a no okay I'm not national public losers of internet
5911.58,5916.94, I actually actually have a thing for McDonald's or anything I have a thing for McDonald's breakfast
5916.94,5921.34, like you find it strangely hard to resist when in an airport very early in the morning
5921.900000000001,5926.7, like and it I think it's mainly because I've been a vegetarian for a long long time okay and uh there's
5926.7,5930.78, some things it's like the one thing that I can have at McDonald's because it doesn't have meat you
5930.78,5938.22, can have a biscuit with egg and cheese and it's this total non food thing you know right like
5938.22,5944.46, it's the egg is in the San natural so yeah but it's got the smell they've got some sort of like engineered
5944.46,5949.66, yeah smell it probably has some sort of chemical in it that just makes me like one that's
5949.66,5959.099999999999, Berkeley talking right there okay engineered smell like Joe I was totally agree with him
5960.94,5966.38, you know it's so Berkeley I was totally agreeing with that they had a story in Berkeley last night
5966.38,5969.74, on the daily show you guys should download it this time I saw that one you should talk about
5969.74,5975.66, too you're visiting that fucking despicable protest oh god yeah I took my I took my uh field
5975.66,5982.22, recorder I haven't like an audio field recorder down to the big uh uh marine protest yeah that was
5982.22,5986.22, the daily show story that I saw yeah yeah yeah we made the new one this is they they did
5986.22,5990.86, it wasn't at the protest they they went and like interviewed people from code pink which is the
5990.86,5996.78, yeah the Berkeley organization the protests the marine recruitment office and if you live in Berkeley
5996.78,6003.099999999999, you can drive by every day and see these people out there and it's pretty much like the the
6003.1,6012.06, the drags of Berkeley you know people who should probably not be allowed to leave their houses
6012.06,6018.06, for fear that they might you know step into traffic and die because they lack the the kind of
6018.06,6024.54, common sense and the brains that get most of us through the day without violent death well you said
6024.54,6031.1, you saw one of the fools from the tree protest yeah well no you had relocated the the tree no I didn't
6031.1,6035.42, see anyone from the tree protest I talked to you did I read about this actually it was actually
6035.42,6040.14, yeah the San Francisco Chronicle identified them by their because they have some dumb made up names
6040.14,6045.660000000001, that they have and it and it placed several you need to give some context for our non-californian
6045.660000000001,6051.34, listeners basically Berkeley everything you heard about is true but along as time there's job
6051.34,6055.660000000001, you think at the University of Berkeley they had these trees that they wanted to okay everything is
6055.660000000001,6059.740000000001, going to take more explanation their stadium is built on the middle of a fucking fault line
6060.219999999999,6063.9, they need to renovate it and relocate it and do some other stuff but that's going to require
6063.9,6069.26, cutting down a few trees that the school planted in what the 1920s or something as decoration
6069.26,6077.9, yeah so some locals decided no it cut down those fucking trees how many trees in like in
6077.9,6083.58, seriously important areas in the country are getting cut down not by the twos or threes
6083.58,6087.98, but by the fucking thousands but they they would save in these trees you know this whole
6087.98,6092.86, think locally shit yeah let me interrupt you with something though huh what would tree beard think
6092.86,6097.66, about all this well tree beard kind of you guys like fucking ceremony tree and stayed in there
6097.66,6104.139999999999, it stood in his own fucking feces for half of year well like shit well the feces drip down onto
6104.139999999999,6108.54, the area and turn the whole place into just a rotting okay you're not explaining this very well
6108.54,6114.86, the world camped up in the trees to plant us yeah as a former protest but really it was a lot of
6115.179999999999,6120.7, people who had been bummed around as homeless like you know alcoholics and Berkeley anyway and
6120.7,6125.74, they just decided to live in the trees and so they had a giant shit bucket which apparently
6125.74,6133.98, extremely unsanitary and lots of it sorry for the hyperbole yeah
6133.98,6139.98, down on the I'm the ground below and has made like a really disgusting mess that's true
6140.62,6144.78, Robert went and interviewed these people yeah I did I took my filter cordu and met a guy who
6144.78,6152.219999999999, called himself orange and said that his name last week had been apple but we I got it yeah
6152.219999999999,6158.7, he didn't have a real name the salve Walter broils a third I tried to hurt name because I had I had
6158.7,6163.74, had this you know stewing anger about the people in the trees for a long time and what day I was like
6163.74,6168.0599999999995, you know maybe I don't get it maybe I'm just being judgmental maybe I should go down there and talk
6168.06,6172.22, to them and see you know maybe they have a reason to be down there and they go down there and
6172.22,6177.900000000001, they were they were absolutely the craziest people I've ever met I mean there is a girl there
6177.900000000001,6183.900000000001, who sat who was sitting in the bushes like with the top list with sparkle paint all over her
6183.900000000001,6189.580000000001, that doesn't sound bad no check it out but her hair was mad dirty I go to interview the
6189.580000000001,6195.900000000001, guy orange near her he has a sit down in like a patch of crap like like in a bush you know it's
6195.98,6200.379999999999, like we could have sat in the grass but he wants to sit in a bush so we like kneel down and
6200.379999999999,6206.0599999999995, this bush and I start asking him why he's there and the girl who is topless with the sparkle paint
6207.339999999999,6212.86, suddenly becomes angry after just talking to him for about 30 seconds and comes over to me and says
6212.86,6220.62, excuse me I am pregnant and I'm trying to have my baby off the grid can you take your technology
6220.62,6231.66, somewhere else she was wow five feet away from a busy street like in the woods like in the
6231.66,6238.22, looking you know fertile boom of mother nature she was in a heavily traffic part of the the campus
6238.22,6243.98, of the University of California at Berkeley but anyway I talked to this guy for like 30 minutes
6243.98,6249.5, in which he proceeded to explain to me how the public university system in California equals the man
6249.98,6255.74, I really couldn't figure that out considering they're like starved for money and you know trying
6255.74,6261.58, to give a decent education to the people who don't have you know the money to go to Stanford out here
6261.58,6267.26, but you know he absolutely thought of things in terms of like everybody just wants money
6267.9,6272.3, you know actually Stanford now is fairly you know they have the sole program now that
6272.3,6278.3, yeah free tuition for families who make less than I think that's a hundred thousand years
6278.3,6282.7, I think it's even more than that I think it's like 150 thousand a year all right
6282.7,6287.26, and we love that there's a better thing you got to get in to Stanford but it's like
6287.26,6292.38, it's a power to the accept their powerful incentive you know why are we from moving the story
6292.38,6299.18, log but Apple yeah then takes us back to project pink okay project pink there there's a marine
6299.26,6309.820000000001, codepink yeah so there's a marine recruiting station in downtown Berkeley and in furthermore
6309.820000000001,6315.02, I've I as I understand it it's actually specialized as a recruiting officers who have like enrolled
6315.02,6319.9800000000005, in the universities RTC program yeah let me and it's been there a lot explain what you're
6319.9800000000005,6325.820000000001, going to say and then okay give you a little bit about that that said codepink decided
6326.78,6331.66, that they don't want the recruiting that they're recruiting officers not welcome in the city
6331.66,6337.82, and that somehow as as if they go and they take people by the scrubber the neck and forcibly
6338.139999999999,6342.94, pull them in there and then hold it under their head and say you know what we need to decide
6342.94,6348.219999999999, these papers and as if they're not adults is if they're not condescending to adults who are
6348.219999999999,6352.54, making the decision you know deciding how to live their lives and what they want to do but then
6352.62,6357.42, that was enough right there they're entitled to do that that's totally fine but they then
6357.42,6363.98, pressure the city who agreed that like you know what we're going to provide these codepink people
6365.1,6370.38, operation pick whatever it is something pink the stinky pink we're going to give this sorry
6370.38,6376.06, that was I'm called for our politics we're going to give the summer sparking parking spot in front
6376.06,6380.38, of their recruiting station and they're going to be able to use that at all times it's reserved
6380.38,6384.62, just for them so it's like what the fuck is this dry through protesting but then technically they
6384.62,6391.900000000001, got it once a week okay you're my fact check right yes so then then the the city actually
6391.900000000001,6396.62, signed some you know bit of paper some announcement saying that you know the their recruiting officer's
6396.62,6402.46, not welcome in the city and this is the only part where I am now I am now saying this was wrong
6402.46,6406.62, that's what that's what this point yeah whatever people are allowed to approach so then
6406.62,6411.34, it was then city council passing this thing saying right and then they had the protests and the
6411.34,6416.7, saddest thing was that it was then immediately characterized between the pink crazies who are like
6417.58,6421.9, they you know we we can't believe this it's there it's right to do it but but protesting that the
6421.9,6426.3, city you know back up them and officially say that they're not welcome here then the other
6426.3,6431.5, cider people like oh we totally support the war and I rack and you know go war and all this it's like
6431.5,6436.78, where the fuck happened at the middle ground right dude and then once taking you like what I just said
6436.78,6440.78, you go in there when you want to when you decide that's what the career goes and this is what makes
6440.78,6446.22, me want to defend the Berkeley in this discussion here is like you know that the the idea of protest
6446.22,6452.46, of course is perfectly American oh yeah so the anti Berkeley protests that followed this idiotic
6452.46,6458.54, decision about the city council to me was starting to get really uncomfortable now this Berkeley
6458.54,6463.9, should succeed from the union crap you know that that is more protest that you're just saying
6463.9,6470.3, that you just said you wanted to defend though of course I'm just saying that like the fact of Berkeley
6470.3,6475.34, that even that this does not mean Berkeley therefore should succeed from the union no it's not
6475.34,6479.98, that's the whole notion of the protest is that it's like fucking lunacy like there's no proportion
6479.98,6485.98, I just I've not been both sides we're absolutely showing their worst I mean there is a big protest
6485.98,6492.94, that I went to after after the city council passed their ordinance it was the week after and
6492.94,6498.7, everyone knew it's going to be a big national deal all the all the news people showed up and I
6498.7,6505.419999999999, go down there and it's literally people in code pink shirts that are screaming about you know
6505.419999999999,6512.7, the Marines being killers versus people in rush limba t shirts and like vacant looks in their eyes
6512.78,6517.5, like yelling and screaming at you know basically we should have nuked the entire
6517.5,6523.0199999999995, power it was even and it read a false sides it was so disheartening to me like to go down there
6523.0199999999995,6527.98, it was like oh my god I don't understand was wrong with us like it was it was terrible I mean
6529.98,6534.46, what I was gonna mention is I was just overhearing like little many fights all the time I was
6534.46,6541.0199999999995, going out to my recorder and what one of them was one of the sort of people on the right yelling at
6541.580000000001,6547.26, one of the local Berkeley guys the local Berkeley guys like you know what we don't want the Marines
6547.26,6551.660000000001, coming down here and recruiting our high school children because we're right next to the high school
6551.660000000001,6556.22, he's like look at that high school it's right there right next to the recruiter and the other guys like
6557.34,6563.660000000001, but it's a recruiting office for college aged kids don't you know that it's for the college
6563.660000000001,6566.9400000000005, and then the yelling and he's like fuck you you don't know what you're talking about you know
6566.94,6572.62, there's screaming at each other and not not able to communicate anything at all and just like
6572.62,6578.54, blasting music like the the people who were there to protest Berkeley showed up with a giant PA system
6578.54,6584.46, and they played like Toby Keith songs at maximum volume the entire time you know that's what we're
6584.46,6590.54, gonna put a boot up your ass that's not fair oh it was it was hidey is dirty yeah that's dirty politics
6590.54,6595.42, yeah without paint could have played lasted the integral girls though yeah it's awesome
6596.62,6602.06, I don't know how we got on this so somehow turned into the local Berkeley city city council
6603.18,6609.66, we can review yeah it was a national news story though so I think people are here about it
6609.66,6613.82, back to smash brother like I said it was on the daily show last night and I would love to play a video game
6613.82,6618.62, that would that would portray the events of this Berkeley protests we need to like same Berkeley
