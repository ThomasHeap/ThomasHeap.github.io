0.0,4.16, Hello and welcome to GAFW.
4.16,5.64, Do you have to be radio? What is it?
5.64,7.44, What is it? I'm going to say there.
7.44,9.64, That was a bad Freudian slip actually.
9.64,10.64, GAF.
10.64,12.98," No, this isn't Gaff radius."
12.98,14.44, Do you have to be radio?
14.44,16.2, This is our last one of GDC.
16.2,17.2, Thank God.
17.2,18.68," No, I didn't mean that."
18.68,19.68, They've been fought.
19.68,20.88, But we have Ken Levine on.
20.88,23.48, We have 15 minutes to talk.
23.48,29.28," Ken Levine was, we just named you are our person of the year at GFW."
29.28,31.44," And it's a pretty, you should know how high an honor that."
31.44,34.2," Because the last two years, it's been before you."
34.2,37.92, It was Jim Boulouchey and Hitler.
37.92,38.92, Now it's you.
38.92,42.08," It's Hitler's dog, actually."
42.08,44.8, So congrats following back to the company.
44.8,47.64," It was an honor to, what happened?"
47.64,48.64, I don't know.
48.64,49.64, Something happened.
49.64,51.44, We said you were great this year.
51.44,52.44, We said you were great.
52.44,53.44, Your game was pretty great too.
53.44,56.96, You and my mom feel the same way.
56.96,58.6, We're close.
58.6,60.4, So let's not go down that road.
60.4,61.36, Me and your mom.
61.36,62.84," So we've got a lot to talk about, right?"
62.84,63.84, We do.
63.84,65.36, How bitter and angry we are.
65.36,66.36, Tired?
66.36,67.36, Yeah.
67.36,68.36, Yeah.
68.36,69.36, We all look tired.
69.36,70.36, Let me say this my first time in this room.
70.36,73.36, And I didn't realize what a miserable fucking sack of shit you guys.
73.36,75.64, I'm just fucking disgusting.
75.64,79.36," How unhappy you look and just like, you hate your lives."
79.36,80.36, You could jump.
80.36,81.36, It's crazy.
81.36,82.36, That's a great idea.
82.36,83.76, It's your knees and talk about what we're happy.
83.76,84.76," Yeah, it's disgusting."
84.76,85.76," But listen, I'm with you."
85.76,86.76, I feel that.
86.76,87.76, Touch underneath that desk.
87.76,92.04, Do you notice the only decoration on here is three ever-quest monkeys?
92.04,95.68, That's how sad this is.
95.68,97.48, That is how you keep the employees happy.
97.48,98.48, cardboard.
98.48,100.12, City times here we are.
100.12,101.12, Yeah.
101.12,104.68, So let's so we asked Ken a question before he has to leave.
104.68,108.96000000000001," Yeah, how are we going to ask him to minimum words other than to say, let's give you a topic."
108.96000000000001,109.96000000000001, I can't a little longer.
109.96000000000001,110.96000000000001, I go along.
110.96000000000001,111.96000000000001, A little longer.
111.96000000000001,117.72," Well, we were very intrigued by the transcription of the panel talk you had."
117.72,119.2, That we read on Gamma Sutra.
119.2,120.44, It's kind of pretty cool.
120.44,124.2, And that's sort of been up the alley of a lot of stuff we've been thinking about.
124.2,126.68, It's Sean's been talking about on one-up year's a lot.
126.68,127.96," So yeah, just narrative."
127.96,130.2," I mean, taking forever to wrap it all up."
130.2,136.68," Just did a discussion about cutscenes, finding a language that's native to the medium,"
136.68,138.44, to tell stories if we were going to do it.
138.44,143.32, And also the difference between telling stories and creating stories with collaboratively
143.32,144.64, between programmer and player.
144.64,146.16, So to speak.
146.24,149.52," So yeah, just get you to bullshit on stories."
149.52,152.07999999999998, As storytelling a game is the whole.
152.07999999999998,154.16," Yeah, I think the purpose of the talk."
154.16,157.44, I'm sure people can find it on the internet or certainly get my people pitching about
157.44,158.44, it on the internet.
158.44,162.56, But that we're a unique medium.
162.56,168.92," And aping linear medium, like film and television and books, it's kind of a waste opportunity."
168.92,176.0," I think the most thing to me that's important about what I said is a very obvious thing,"
176.08,178.56, which is what are you looking at in games?
178.56,179.92, You're not looking at the characters.
179.92,184.56, You're not looking at the dynamics sequence of animation.
184.56,185.56, You're looking at the world.
185.56,189.08, And that is your bread and butter for everything.
189.08,193.36, So why divorce the story from the world so much?
193.36,198.32," And I think with Baja, we tried to really tell as much of the story in the world as possible."
198.32,199.92000000000002, And you just think about all the games you play.
199.92000000000002,200.72, Even great games.
200.72,201.72, I love fear.
201.72,203.2, I think it's a great game.
203.2,205.4," But man, what are they saying with that world?"
205.44,206.4, And what are ways to the opportunity?
206.4,211.8," If they got their vibe and their gameplay, if they got their world up to the level"
211.8,214.8," of their vibe and their gameplay and their AI, I mean forget it."
214.8,218.20000000000002, I mean Baja could be a joke.
218.20000000000002,220.20000000000002, They have so much opportunity there.
220.20000000000002,221.6, And I know they have the guys there.
221.6,223.6, They have crag in those guys.
223.6,225.6," Oh, sorry."
225.6,228.04000000000002," You know, it seems like a missed opportunity for a lot of people."
228.04000000000002,233.28," And you know, listen, I'm sure you can point to Baja, I can point out 30,000 other"
233.28,234.8, missed opportunities that we had.
234.8,237.20000000000002, So this is the drum ambitian on today.
237.20000000000002,242.24," Just because, hey, you know, hey, I have a little credibility in this very small corner"
242.24,243.48000000000002, right now.
243.48000000000002,249.4," But just, you know, the world is such a great, such a, that's the heart of what the"
249.4,250.64000000000001, gamer experiences.
250.64000000000001,251.64000000000001, So let's leverage it.
251.64000000000001,255.4," I was thinking about, you know, you haven't getting a lot of credit for Baja's"
255.4,259.12," shock in terms of the story, but when I was thinking about your games today, you know,"
259.12,262.68, even the freedom force games had a shitload of story in them.
262.68,267.12, And that's something that like to me is what keeps them memorable today.
267.12,271.32, And what's particularly unique about those games is that they were strategy games.
271.32,275.16," I mean, why do you think it's so hard in that particular genre?"
275.16,280.28000000000003," In the genre you were in with Bioshock, there's at least, you know, there's more opportunity"
280.28000000000003,281.6, to at least say here's a plot.
281.6,282.6, Yeah.
282.6,288.0," Well, first of all, I do want to bask in the glory of being of the freedom force with"
288.0,291.0, Third Reich was a lowest selling cityw cover in history.
291.0,292.0, Did we tell you that?
292.0,293.68," Yeah, you said it on fire."
293.68,296.28," And I was on my run and I was like, oh, yeah."
296.28,299.36, That's not a figure of the entire fuck that guy.
299.36,301.36," No, it wasn't our fault."
301.36,303.36," Oh, it was my fault."
303.36,304.36, It was my fault.
304.36,305.36," No, it wasn't your Z either."
305.36,306.36," No, it was my fault."
306.36,308.4, There's a lot of shitty leaders out there.
308.4,309.4, You know what?
309.4,310.4, Turned their nose up at the good news.
310.4,311.92, Let me say one thing about that cover.
311.92,312.92, Yeah.
312.92,314.44," Because this is, this, it had, you know, who's thought it was?"
314.44,316.36, It's just fucking company I work for.
316.36,317.36, That's his fun.
317.36,319.36, I don't mind saying it.
319.36,322.12, I don't mean Microsoft because I don't work for them.
322.12,323.12, And they're awesome.
323.12,324.12, Gains are windows.
324.12,325.12, Yeah.
325.12,334.12," What I mean is, when we were working on the free and forced cover, they, at that point, all"
334.12,338.2, our covers had to go through these folks in New York who are not gamers.
338.2,341.52000000000004," You know, they're like magazine people in New York and most of them aren't even magazine"
341.52000000000004,342.52000000000004, people.
342.52000000000004,343.84000000000003, They're like being counter people.
343.84000000000003,346.12, And we would have to run our covers to them.
346.12,350.68," And at that point, if it wasn't, you know, a franchise that they heard of and what"
350.68,355.92," franchises, what PC franchises are non gamers going to have heard of in New York."
355.92,356.92, Almost nothing.
356.92,358.2," We don't even have a Mario, right?"
358.2,359.2, So there he comes.
359.2,360.2, Michael Jordan.
360.2,362.52," Yeah, we had Michael Jordan on the cover one month."
362.52,365.0," No, it was supposed to be a balder's."
365.0,366.0, Balder's gate to cover.
366.0,367.0, And then steady.
367.0,368.0, Then it flies.
368.0,369.0, No one knows what that is.
369.0,373.04," So they said, do you should do a holiday theme cover and just put a bunch of holiday games"
373.04,374.04, on it.
374.6,376.64000000000004, Right in the center that was Michael Jordan.
376.8,377.16, How does it?
377.16,378.16, Was like an NBA lie.
378.16,379.16, How does it show?
379.16,380.12, It's so like shit.
380.12,381.12, All right.
381.12,385.56," But so with freedom force, what happened was they never heard of the game."
385.56,386.40000000000003, They never heard of the franchise.
386.40000000000003,390.56, It didn't matter that we were saying that doesn't matter because PC gamers know it.
390.56,393.68," And even if PC gamers don't know it, we want to champion the game because we love"
393.68,394.68, this franchise.
394.68,396.08000000000004, They said that doesn't matter.
396.08000000000004,397.08000000000004, No one knows what it is.
397.08000000000004,399.20000000000005, So we actually use the art from your game.
399.2,402.44, But the cover line said X men.
402.44,404.92, It's said look out X men in giant letters.
404.92,407.76," And then in tiny letters, here comes freedom force."
407.76,408.76, True.
408.76,412.52," And you know, but what they were looking at was an X men line with the character they"
412.52,413.52, never saw.
413.52,419.8, I'm comfortable pinning the financial failure of my game on those fuckers.
419.8,425.08, So I'm just I'm going to take any responsibility from me for making that game.
425.08,428.32, And maybe not having enough features and making too much like an expansion pack.
428.32,429.84, Maybe not marketing enough.
429.84,430.84, Fuck those guys.
430.84,431.84, They're ready for them.
431.84,432.84, But I don't.
432.84,434.84, They can flew out of my baby's mouth.
434.84,435.84, Those people.
435.84,437.24, That's the headline for tomorrow.
437.24,438.24, So it's end of the game.
438.24,439.24, So the fifth day of this.
439.24,440.24, Yes.
440.24,441.24, The fifth day of this ruin freedom force.
441.24,442.24, Starving his.
442.24,444.52," If you want to see it freedom force three, you know where to line up outside."
444.52,446.24, Is it a deal with the address?
446.24,447.24, No.
447.24,448.24, I'm bad.
448.24,449.24, I don't know that.
449.24,450.24, You got it.
450.24,451.24," Fuck, you're a dollar off."
451.24,452.24, Look at my PC gamers.
452.24,453.24, S&D.com.
453.24,458.28," So to back at the storytelling thing, you told us in a previous interview."
458.35999999999996,461.11999999999995, That you looked at cutscenes like date rape.
461.11999999999995,463.2, And you're going to have to explain that again.
463.2,466.4," But the thing is, this week, I've gotten in all the shit for us."
466.4,469.2, They maybe cutscenes are the best way to tell a story.
469.2,470.76," I mean, challenging all these things."
470.76,473.47999999999996, But the thing that's surprising is you see all these.
473.47999999999996,476.47999999999996, I'm trying to figure out why cutscenes are so dear to so many people.
476.47999999999996,478.0," Because to me, I'm always in different tune."
478.0,479.0, A lot of people.
479.0,481.23999999999995, They've always got a final fantasy avatars.
481.23999999999995,482.84, It has something to do with it.
482.84,483.84, Maybe.
483.84,486.59999999999997," And it's like, oh, Eric."
486.59999999999997,487.59999999999997, Yeah.
488.56,489.08000000000004, Nothing.
489.08000000000004,491.40000000000003, Nothing's moved me as much as these cutscenes ever.
491.40000000000003,492.40000000000003, No.
492.40000000000003,495.6," And it's like, I just want to, you know, since this is the shithead hour, I just want"
495.6,497.20000000000005, to like diagnose them with diasporters.
497.20000000000005,498.20000000000005, But what do you?
498.20000000000005,499.48," Oh, I just made a fight."
499.48,500.24, You don't look.
500.24,503.68," I think the thing is, people when when Eric died, right?"
503.68,507.24," That's sort of the 7-0 moment, not 3-4 what I just did."
507.24,510.36," But I think that was a real, that was the first time"
510.36,512.24," they experienced an emotion in the genre, right?"
512.24,513.48, In the medium.
513.48,515.24, And so maybe in their lives.
515.24,516.24, In their lives.
516.32,517.48, That's the point of making.
517.48,520.36, I'm certainly about a woman.
520.36,523.52, And who they knew.
523.52,526.08, And I think that had a big effect on people.
526.08,528.08," And back then, it wasn't like you'd"
528.08,530.2, going to look at the 320 by 200 display or whatever.
530.2,531.36, It wasn't having an emotion.
531.36,533.84," So you need, you know, I then little characters running around"
533.84,534.96, these goofy little characters.
534.96,537.48," So the full render cutscenes, they would"
537.48,539.28," have bring a well-known art form, which"
539.28,541.4," is making animated film, basically."
541.4,543.76, And people don't have a leverage of motion there.
543.76,545.28, We didn't know if that time had a leverage
545.28,549.0799999999999, of motion in an non-linear way.
549.0799999999999,552.28," And so naturally, their first experience with it,"
552.28,555.0799999999999, they're going to naturally be drawn to that as that's a place
555.0799999999999,556.48, they get emotion out of.
556.48,559.3199999999999, And what I like to say step back from a problem for a second
559.3199999999999,560.28, is that's not the part.
560.28,561.48, And that's not to say fuck cutscenes.
561.48,564.0799999999999," What's not to say, you know,"
564.0799999999999,569.6, screw integrated narrative to pretend I'm teaching a college course.
569.6,570.56, And so that's not the non-part.
570.56,571.3199999999999, Let's be totally non-part.
571.3199999999999,574.52, And say which way do you think the medium in 10 years
574.52,577.36," is going to be more the direction of more cutscenes,"
577.36,580.28," more into those things, or more into integrated?"
580.28,582.28," And I think even if you're a big fan of cutscenes,"
582.28,585.16, you feel the natural progression probably
585.16,586.76, is towards more integrated.
586.76,589.76, And so I'm not saying that's one better or worse.
589.76,592.72, I think it's Darwinian kind of guy.
592.72,595.3199999999999, And I think it's just sort of naturally going that way.
595.3199999999999,597.0, My feeling is it's better.
597.0,598.4399999999999, I'm happy it's going that way.
598.4399999999999,600.1999999999999, I wish I could take credit for this.
600.1999999999999,602.4399999999999, I stand on the shoulders of giants.
602.44,606.24," I like Valve and other companies who started this before,"
606.24,608.5200000000001," you know, when we stood seven sisters shocked too."
608.5200000000001,611.24, But I think that's the way it's going.
611.24,614.48," In the context of talking about telling a story through,"
614.48,616.8800000000001," I mean, integrated narrative, an example would be like you're"
616.8800000000001,619.96," saying when you enter rapture, when you're walking through the halls,"
619.96,622.8800000000001, you're getting story of some sort.
622.8800000000001,624.9200000000001, You're finding out the history.
624.9200000000001,626.2800000000001, It's like being on an archeological dig.
626.2800000000001,628.5200000000001, But so that effect I just want to ask you
628.5200000000001,629.96, if you ever played psycho-notts.
629.96,631.36, That came as cutscenes of stuff.
631.36,632.1600000000001," And again, I agree with that."
632.16,634.28, Not like cutscenes are always bad all the time.
634.28,635.92," But it's like if there are other,"
635.92,639.4, I'm just for people at least trying to find this native voice
639.4,643.0, for games to communicate narrative and all these things.
643.0,644.88," But I mean, there are a specific play to psycho-notts"
644.88,650.16, because the whole theme was that the level would be the mind
650.16,651.88, of a person and you're playing inside of it
651.88,653.0, and they do the same thing.
653.0,654.8399999999999," Yeah, and I think the most effective part"
654.8399999999999,656.68, were those levels and not the cutscenes.
656.68,660.0799999999999," I think the cutscenes were a little, look,"
660.08,664.8000000000001, I have a pretty determined feeling to sort of not like cutscenes
664.8000000000001,665.96, because I want to play the game.
665.96,666.88, I'm sitting in front of a game.
666.88,667.88, I don't want to sit there and watch.
667.88,669.0400000000001, I want to play.
669.0400000000001,672.2, So I talked to the guys who did on Charter yesterday
672.2,673.64, and the biggest compliment I could pay them
673.64,674.64," was, hey, guess what?"
674.64,677.24," I watched your cutscenes and I enjoyed them because usually,"
677.24,683.24," I'm just like, and even in second knots,"
683.24,685.96, I felt I'd rather be in the world having this experience
685.96,688.1600000000001, to see those weird dreamscapes in the world.
688.1600000000001,689.48, Because there's just so much more interesting
689.48,692.8000000000001," than a dialogue the characters had at these sort of very suggestive,"
692.8000000000001,696.2, very sort of a dolly-esque dream-scapes.
696.2,698.76, We're way more interesting than any kind of story
698.76,700.48, about a summer camp to me.
700.48,702.4, The environment was great and they were a leverage
702.4,705.36, to the environment that whole summer camp was cool.
705.36,708.04, And the dream-scapes were cool.
708.04,710.4," So man, put me in those quickly as possible."
710.4,711.84, Let me stay in those things.
711.84,713.16, So you kind of the kind of person
713.16,716.2, who would never in their lives go into the mass effect
716.2,719.16, like Encyclopedia to start reading all that backstory.
719.16,723.7199999999999," You know, I was talking about my talk yesterday."
723.7199999999999,728.52," And I'll preface this by saying, the people who do people at Bioware,"
728.52,731.3199999999999," if you're going to do that approach, watch out"
731.3199999999999,732.92, because those are the guys to beat.
732.92,737.6, Those are the guys who know how to make just a breath of information
737.6,739.4399999999999, and make the characters believable.
739.4399999999999,741.8399999999999," Listen, the first I love Baldur's Gate 2"
741.8399999999999,745.6, because I love the interaction between the characters.
745.6,748.64, And so I think that it's very hard for me
748.64,750.8, to find a world that I'm interested in enough in
750.8,755.68, to want to read that stuff because I'm nearly the literate
755.68,757.28, for one and two.
757.28,759.4," I just, you know, I'm too old for that shit."
759.4,761.6, Just in terms of getting that deeply into something.
761.6,763.76, I think there are worlds that I have that level of literature
763.76,766.56, but it takes years you're going to get there.
766.56,768.56," You know, I talk about world of the workcraft a lot."
768.56,770.88," And I felt that, I just so, last night I was interested in I go"
770.88,773.84," and I play, you know, I went mad at that award last night"
773.84,775.4399999999999, and I have this experience of going up
775.44,778.8000000000001," to being honored, it was great and it was a thrill."
778.8000000000001,780.0, And it was great.
780.0,782.48, And I got this award and people are clapping.
782.48,786.2, So I go over the home last night and I'm playing my new hunter.
786.2,787.44, My new dronai.
787.44,788.9200000000001, Jonai is it?
788.9200000000001,790.5200000000001," You could say that, but I'm not sure."
790.5200000000001,791.7600000000001," But proprio, you're not."
791.7600000000001,792.6, Did you deny?
792.6,793.6, I could say I'm playing my dronai.
793.6,794.6, I'm sorry.
794.6,798.4000000000001," And I do some quest in the, you know,"
798.4000000000001,800.0, in the sort of the starting area.
800.0,802.0400000000001," And it's a, I always solo."
802.0400000000001,803.44, So I never had done this quest before
803.44,805.6, and then I played through the dronai a little bit before.
805.6,807.8800000000001," Because it was a two person quest that I managed to somehow,"
807.8800000000001,809.8000000000001, it went out even though it was meant to be a two person quest.
809.8000000000001,812.9200000000001," And you get like the reward is like, you go back to this little house"
812.9200000000001,815.7600000000001, and you get this award which is some cool weapon and a tabard.
815.7600000000001,816.7600000000001," I'm like, oh, a tabard cool."
816.7600000000001,818.5600000000001, And I get this little tabard and put on I never had a tabard.
818.5600000000001,821.24," I'm not a geok, I don't want any friends."
821.24,823.8800000000001, And I turn around and I walk outside.
823.8800000000001,826.24, And they're all these fucking wow characters lined up.
826.24,827.08, Oh yeah.
827.08,828.6," I really, I really, oh, that's a great mind."
828.6,829.44, Shearing for me.
829.44,831.7600000000001, And I just have that experience in real life.
831.76,835.2," For I, you know, a few minutes before or a few hours before."
835.2,837.3199999999999, I'm not sure which one I enjoyed more.
837.3199999999999,839.52," You know, do you know why they were cheering for you?"
839.52,840.52, Had you read any of the quest?
840.52,842.52," No, and that's a point is, is that I'm not."
842.52,844.68," You would save the whole, all those people."
844.68,845.88," That whole, I was sure."
845.88,848.8," Okay, I say, I say the dronai people, whatever,"
848.8,850.72," either my point is with wow, I don't fucking care"
850.72,852.36," and they don't, you don't have to care."
852.36,855.2, There's so much narrative just in the visual space
855.2,858.2, that I'd rather come to my own conclusions about it.
858.2,859.36, And they don't force it on you.
859.36,861.08, They don't force you to sit through anything.
861.08,863.44, They have tons of me's on set around the world.
863.44,865.12," That bullshit I was talking about yesterday about,"
865.12,867.32," you know, telling a story in the world, little moments"
867.32,869.96," in the world, you know, apart in, by,"
869.96,871.88," I'm sure, sure, sure, sure, trough or whatever,"
871.88,873.8000000000001," where you free those kids and, you know,"
873.8000000000001,876.5200000000001, from the real prison gets in you one time I'm standing in town.
876.5200000000001,879.2," I say I'm running back in, you know, like all excited."
879.2,880.48," You know, they have all this narrative"
880.48,882.44," when you first go into the dark portal, you know,"
882.44,883.76, they have this big narrative thing.
883.76,885.1600000000001," Do I, and I'm saying, I don't even know what the dark."
885.1600000000001,886.5600000000001, I don't understand what any of that crap is.
886.5600000000001,887.5600000000001, I don't even know what outland is.
887.5600000000001,888.5600000000001, Is it a different planet?
888.5600000000001,889.4000000000001, I don't know.
889.4000000000001,890.24, I don't care.
890.24,893.24, But it's awesome.
893.24,895.52," You know, when I see that, I see that, that, that,"
895.52,897.44," that guard post, you know, have destroyed"
897.44,899.2, with a part of it floating in the air.
899.2,901.28," And I don't need, I don't need to know what happened there."
901.28,902.2, I just think it's great.
902.2,904.2, And I make my own stories in my head.
905.36,906.2, Right.
906.2,908.72," I, I just find it, I find it fascinating"
908.72,910.36, that you won that award and that went bad.
910.36,911.36, That was a great idea.
911.36,914.2," I'm thinking, you're, you're all the kids at home"
914.2,916.44," are thinking like, man, he probably got in the limo"
916.44,918.84," and they're like, like, three playboy bunnies in there."
918.84,921.0400000000001, And then you went home and you played wow.
921.0400000000001,922.44, And you are happy playing wow.
922.44,923.24, Yeah.
923.24,923.6, Yeah.
923.6,924.9200000000001," It's not so glamorous, being you."
924.9200000000001,928.1600000000001," Oh, you know, I remember after yesterday, after my talk,"
928.1600000000001,928.84, because some guys gave a thing.
928.84,930.12, So what's it like to be celebrity?
930.12,932.64," I'm like, that's not exactly being in the fucking Rolling Stones."
932.64,934.48," Because I'm like, I'm looking around."
934.48,936.2800000000001," And it's like, all these are like, you know, really great"
936.2800000000001,939.72," sweet guys, you know, like guys."
939.72,943.0400000000001," Guys, you know, dudes, you know, let's have my married"
943.0400000000001,943.88, guys.
943.88,944.6, So it's not really much of a problem.
944.6,946.0400000000001, But you're getting to this gate
946.0400000000001,948.36," if you're getting into this gig for the, for the ladies."
948.36,949.2, The ladies.
949.2,951.36," And they were like, oh, goodness."
951.36,954.4," So we asked this question before like, how do you're"
954.4,955.4, at this point in your career?
955.4,958.52," Like, how do you, your parents and your extended family"
958.52,961.04," treat you like, do they recognize you as successful?"
961.04,963.64," And, you know, semi celebrity you weren't ever"
963.64,964.6800000000001, you want to call it?
964.6800000000001,966.84," Yeah, I mean, again, I think, you know,"
966.84,970.12, this celebrity term is a strange one because it's very
970.12,971.48, different in the games in the shame where I was.
971.48,975.32," I mean, the best part about being where I'm at is I can do"
975.32,976.4, cool stuff.
976.4,977.76," You know, with some that I'm not,"
977.76,979.92, I don't know the fight to like be in a creative
979.92,981.88, position to do cool stuff anymore.
981.88,983.56," And that's, that's been, and I get to work with"
983.56,984.72, really fucking cool people.
984.72,987.6," And, but do your parents, are they still going like,"
987.6,989.16, can when you get to stop at the game?
989.16,991.76," No, I think until now, it was really until"
991.76,995.4," by a shock that my parents, I think they finally got it."
995.4,997.84," Because I, one is I think the game were, well,"
997.84,999.96, I think they were able to engage in what I was doing
999.96,1000.8, and see the game world.
1000.8,1003.0," And it was realized, you know, because they all"
1003.0,1004.2," games, you know, systems are actually"
1004.2,1004.88, pretty crude.
1004.88,1006.84," And any outside looks at it, you know, visually,"
1006.84,1008.76," they're going to say, well, it's kind of weird looking."
1008.76,1011.36," But if you look at BioShock, even if you're a,"
1011.36,1013.4, we're at the point now where a sort of untrained dog
1013.4,1015.8000000000001," can look at it and say, oh, our deco and, you know,"
1015.8000000000001,1017.2800000000001, I always have patty page.
1017.2800000000001,1018.96," Because you know, I talked to my dad and I worked"
1018.96,1020.2, on this soundtrack a little bit together.
1020.2,1021.1600000000001," You know, I called him up and I said,"
1021.1600000000001,1024.8400000000001, tell me we got the music of the period and we went through it.
1024.8400000000001,1026.8400000000001," And so, you know, they really engaged."
1026.8400000000001,1029.16, And I think they came to some of the parties too.
1029.16,1031.16," And my in-laws came to this, the spike thing."
1031.16,1032.68," And they started to realize this isn't some,"
1032.68,1034.28," we know, re-gating thing we're doing here."
1034.28,1037.0," So, you know, some real money and real people doing this."
1037.0,1039.28," And I just think there was a bit of a halo effect of,"
1039.28,1041.8799999999999," you know, you know, we got rid of it in your times"
1041.8799999999999,1043.16," and the Washington Post and they said,"
1043.16,1046.28, see the press and I guess we're just magazine.
1046.28,1048.52, And the highest honor.
1048.52,1049.68, And I'm afraid of it.
1049.68,1052.3999999999999," And I think they realized all of a sudden,"
1052.3999999999999,1054.36," like this isn't some, you know, this isn't a joke."
1054.36,1057.16," You know, that this is real money and real people"
1057.16,1058.52, and real stuff doing this.
1058.52,1060.96, And people and that people were excited.
1060.96,1063.36," They read stuff online, how you know that people got into it."
1063.36,1065.32, And we had an impact on people.
1065.32,1067.76, And it was great because I think they finally connected
1067.76,1070.7199999999998, to what I was doing because it was less abstract to them.
1070.7199999999998,1073.12, And it's really helped because they're fascinated now by it.
1073.12,1074.7199999999998," And when we talk about it all the time,"
1074.7199999999998,1076.36, now we're genuinely talking about it much before.
1076.36,1078.6," And to me, one of the best things that came out of Bioshok"
1078.6,1081.6, was really being able to talk to my parents about what I'm doing
1081.6,1082.76, and have them understand.
1085.04,1086.6," Which is, we get to get our nose."
1086.6,1088.04, We get to get the clock on.
1088.04,1089.04, That's a quick question.
1089.04,1090.4399999999998," Yeah, this is probably 10."
1090.4399999999998,1091.6, For some reason.
1091.6,1093.48," Did you have much to do with, I mean, clearly"
1093.48,1094.76, had much to do with SWAT 4.
1094.76,1096.24," But with the particular mission,"
1096.24,1099.36, where you're going to the serial killer's basement?
1099.36,1101.56, Let me say that actually I didn't have a lot to do with SWAT 4.
1101.56,1104.28," The team really, that was, I had a couple of minor"
1104.28,1105.28," of things in puts in the interface,"
1105.28,1107.1599999999999, but I was doing tries of engines and free of force
1107.1599999999999,1108.76, to third-ranking business at that time.
1108.76,1111.28, So that was really Paul Halquist and eight wells
1111.28,1115.52, and Steve Komerra and Bill Gardner and all the great guys
1115.52,1117.36, in that team that I had very little to do with that.
1117.36,1120.12," So if you love that game, I'm not the guy to beg."
1120.12,1121.36, That was a pretty level.
1121.3999999999999,1122.1999999999998, Yeah.
1122.1999999999998,1126.76," I think that was a lot of Nate Wells, who's our director now."
1126.76,1130.1599999999999, And Nate's also the guy who's had a big daddy.
1130.1599999999999,1132.36, And he's a great guy's been with me since the system
1132.36,1136.3999999999999," shock two days, great friend and a great colleague."
1136.3999999999999,1139.24," But the vibe of that game, that's sort of very dark vibe."
1139.24,1141.0," I mean, we talked about it, but I had very little"
1141.0,1142.24, to do with the execution.
1142.24,1143.56, It was all those guys.
1143.56,1144.3999999999999, True.
1144.3999999999999,1146.3999999999999, The last word tells something that's shitty in the world.
1146.3999999999999,1148.6799999999998, It's not right with you.
1148.6799999999998,1149.52, Whoa.
1149.52,1150.28, You got to end the first time.
1150.28,1151.12, You got to go out the way.
1151.12,1151.96, I was a Bill.
1151.96,1154.16," I went down there, right?"
1154.16,1154.96, So it came in.
1154.96,1155.72, It's how we're going out.
1155.72,1157.24, The status 15 is in the right.
1157.24,1158.24," Oh, wow."
1158.24,1159.52, I found off for every single year.
1159.52,1161.32," You know, I'm going to answer like a bitch, frankly,"
1161.32,1164.08," because like listen, somebody hears me,"
1164.08,1165.52," like, I've had a good year."
1165.52,1167.32," OK, you know, I'm not."
1167.32,1171.08," I got a little wife who I, who I, I fucking love."
1171.08,1173.36, I've got people I work with who I have nothing
1173.36,1173.96, but respect for.
1173.96,1176.48, I get to hang out and bullshit with guys like you.
1176.48,1178.2, I get to say the W hotel.
1178.2,1180.0," You know, like, what do I have to,"
1180.0,1182.8400000000001, I really don't have anything to complain about.
1182.8400000000001,1186.04," I said, you know, it would be, you know,"
1186.04,1188.88," I think if I'm going to play about anything,"
1188.88,1191.32," it's, you know, let's wear the,"
1191.32,1193.16," we don't have to come battle for Galactic as an on,"
1193.16,1194.16," you know, right now."
1194.16,1194.52, Yeah.
1194.52,1196.8," If I'm just to me out, you know,"
1196.8,1200.68," why, you know, why is the, you know,"
1200.68,1202.04, the wow collectible miniature scheme
1202.04,1203.2, not out to the fall.

1204.04,1205.76," You know, I thought for you to get there."
1205.76,1207.3600000000001, There does be bad taste.
1207.36,1209.4799999999998," If that tastes for me to, for me to bitch,"
1209.4799999999998,1211.28," I've been really, really lucky."
1211.28,1212.12, That's true.
1212.12,1214.28," Battle Star Galactic, I'll break it back, back, back, back,"
1214.28,1215.12, we're out.
