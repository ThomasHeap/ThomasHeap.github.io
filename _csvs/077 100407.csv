86.42,92.82000000000001, Hello and welcome to GFW Radio. This is the podcast for October
93.62,98.9, or as I like to call rocktober fourth 2007.
100.42,102.74000000000001, And I'm here alone in this room.
104.18,105.7," Nobody here. Oh, here you guys are."
106.66,113.78, With all the regular staff plus permanent extra six chair. How many chairs do we have?
113.86,117.46000000000001," Six six chair. Yeah six chairs. Well, I can't even just rub it."
117.46000000000001,122.18, I actually slept his way into the six chair. He's here with us again today. Hello. Hello.
122.82000000000001,125.7, And all the rest of the guys are follows.
125.7,131.46, Brain Scott. Daring glassstone. Sean Elliott. Sean Milo. We got a full crew gentleman. We do.
132.02,134.1, It's awesome. Pretty awesome.
134.9,136.74, Fairly awesome. What we did just in that show.
138.42000000000002,139.86," Oh, wait. That joke again."
140.34,145.54000000000002, As so we're all here. We're just off deadline. So we're a little bit. We're a little bit tired. I apologize in advance
145.54000000000002,149.54000000000002, that we're a couple days late. But fuck you. We have jobs.
152.66000000000003,159.70000000000002," Oh, also that intro that you just heard. I'm supposed to read a disclaimer that those opinions were not"
160.42000000000002,164.5, the opinions of Zif Davis or even though I don't know.
164.5,170.82, Or any members of the staff including Sean. Just in case you're a brand new listener and don't
170.82,175.94," know the legacy of the whiskey or whatever, it's a character and so it's a caricature."
176.66,179.7," So in other words, this is like a spinal tap interview."
181.7,188.18, Tell me about this. I just want more. What does he have a name? The new character?
188.18,192.02," That's the same. It's the whiskey nerd. I've been heard it yet. Oh, it's whiskey nerd is back."
192.02,197.14000000000001," Yeah, it's a little angry or something awesome. Yeah. There's a couple parts that are, you know,"
197.14000000000001,201.38," potentially a fan service. I just want to say that don't don't uh, you can be mad at me."
201.38,205.3, It's a whiskey nerd anymore than then you assume that the bottom of my computer desk is loaded
205.3,208.5, with boogers to like tights and all the other parts of the legacy. Yeah. So.
209.54000000000002,213.78, You're okay. But you got that line from somewhere about the boogers to like tights.
214.82000000000002,219.86, That was funny because it's true. I think. I got it from your visiting your office.
220.82000000000002,221.86, Drop it off folders.
223.70000000000002,228.02," That's from like, you know, Mama, you've ever, if you've ever had a car or something."
228.02,231.86," And you know, what's was had especially in high school and you're driving your friends through the mall."
231.86,235.3, And one of those pieces of shit is always going to wipe a book or somewhere in your car.
235.3,239.38000000000002, And you look over and catch him. What do you do in doing? Or like sunflower seeds?
239.38000000000002,242.5," You know, I have like a friend eating sunflower seeds in the back."
242.5,246.34," And when you stop when we get out and go somewhere, you look in the back and the whole, you know,"
246.42000000000002,250.58, floor is covered in. I don't think I'd let anyone get into my car with sunflower seeds.
251.22,253.38, I guess he can't stop the nose.
253.38,256.1, You can't let Sean in your car then.
256.1,260.74, Like he let Sean around. He's got to spit sunflower seeds out the window for like the entire.
260.74,262.34000000000003," Yeah, you know, he does a lot. Yeah."
262.34000000000003,263.62, He kind of got a addiction.
263.62,264.34000000000003, Got a thing.
264.34000000000003,265.46, It's got a salty.
265.46,266.5, So is it the salt?
266.5,268.82," The I get like, I think he's like,"
268.82,270.74, Dil pickle flavored ones. They're pretty good.
270.74,271.14," Oh,"
271.14,273.38, Jil for a solid pin.
274.34,276.34," Got that on that car, uh,"
276.34,277.38, Sri Lenthin.
277.38,278.02, Yeah.
278.02,282.74," There was, there was one time when I think I had had a cold for a while."
282.74,286.34," And so the entire passenger seat was about knee deep and like dirty,"
286.34,287.38, snott rags.
287.38,290.98, And I took a friend and we went to the Indian reservation casino.
290.98,292.98," And he sat up there and he was like,"
292.98,295.38," you know, pretty much up to his knees in the shit."
295.38,297.14, And then we got out.
297.14,299.38, He opens the door and he just started shoveling it all.
299.38,302.34," You know, and inside there too, there was, you know, all the crap, you know, like, um,"
303.29999999999995,305.94," how it is fountain drink cops and shit, you know,"
305.94,310.34," he just shovels it all out into this massive pile, like the parking lot."
310.34,314.34," And then right there, like one of the reservation cops comes up, goes like,"
314.34,316.02," whoa, what's this?"
316.02,319.38," And uh, we were like, oh, shit."
319.38,322.34," I thought you were, I thought you were, I just said it was there."
322.34,323.14, You got away.
323.14,324.9," I thought you're gonna show like Ironized Cody came up,"
324.9,325.85999999999996," you're like, like, with a like,"
325.85999999999996,327.85999999999996, just jumped to the tears.
327.85999999999996,328.34, Yeah.
328.34,334.58," Oh, no, that leaves a sour flavor."
334.58,339.06," But I asked him why he did that and he was just like,"
339.06,341.06," he was like, what is sitting in the anymore?"
341.06,343.94," Oh, he got in that dude that didn't mean the"
343.94,344.97999999999996, in reservation now.
344.97999999999996,347.14," Yeah, that was, it was mostly."
347.14,348.65999999999997, It's about sacred gambling.
348.65999999999997,349.46, That's right.
349.46,350.82, There's no room for litter.
350.82,351.62, It is.
352.41999999999996,353.38," Well, that's true."
353.38,353.62, Yeah.
353.62,355.78," It's kind of like, yeah, we made you all live here."
355.78,357.53999999999996, And also here's our fucking garbage.
358.5,360.82," Oh, oh, I didn't throw it out."
361.86,364.66, But the highest point is that you shouldn't do that anywhere.
364.66,365.3, Really?
365.3,365.62, Yeah.
365.62,366.26000000000005, Yeah.
366.26000000000005,367.78000000000003," Oh, you with your political current."
367.78000000000003,368.5, Just Sam.
368.5,369.06," Damn, hippie."
369.78000000000003,372.26000000000005," Yeah, like, like a couple weeks, you know,"
372.26000000000005,373.38, or maybe it was couple months ago.
373.38,375.38," Remember Robert, we're driving through Oakland and the"
375.38,377.86," current front of us is throwing out like full,"
377.86,380.1," you know, those jumbo McDonald's bags that you get."
380.1,380.5, Really?
380.5,382.1," When you're feeding your whole fucking family,"
382.1,384.26, like they're throwing those out to the window.
384.26,386.90000000000003," It was like that old ass game, a, a, p, b, you know, the first"
386.9,387.85999999999996, thing.
387.85999999999996,388.65999999999997," Like, stop it."
388.65999999999997,390.5, Stop the 15 litter bugs.
390.5,392.26," Yeah, then like 60 or out."
392.26,395.06," It's cops, it's just like, what the fuck is this?"
395.06,395.53999999999996, Yeah.
395.53999999999996,398.41999999999996," Well, you know, I grew up with don't mess with Texas,"
398.41999999999996,401.38, which is some sort of like thing they drill into your brain.
401.38,404.26," That if you litter, you will be like shot and buried."
404.26,405.29999999999995," And that's like, for real."
405.29999999999995,407.21999999999997," And that's like, yeah, Texas."
407.21999999999997,409.21999999999997," That's like, so I'm not a little threat."
409.21999999999997,411.29999999999995," Yeah, we had these commercials where you know,"
411.29999999999995,413.53999999999996, it would be like a guy driving his truck down the highway.
413.53999999999996,415.14, And he throws something out of the car.
415.14,417.21999999999997, And then the Texas Ranger is the air force.
417.21999999999997,419.78," Like, comes out from the distance and swoops down on them."
419.78,421.62," And it's like, don't mess with Texas."
421.62,425.06," So when it's a, when I see people throw extra food out of their car,"
425.06,427.38," I'm like, oh my god, Texas is coming."
427.38,429.38, Yeah.
429.38,431.14," Yeah, that total last sector that actually,"
431.14,433.06," you just reminded me of, I was, I was on, I was on some press"
433.06,434.65999999999997, junk at years ago down in Texas.
434.65999999999997,436.09999999999997, And the PR guy was driving me around.
436.09999999999997,438.5," Like, we were going to go to like, check some stuff out."
438.5,441.7," So some other guy across the highway, hit some other car and"
441.7,443.14," just like, I hit and run and just,"
443.46,444.74," it tells, it peels out."
444.74,447.78," So the PR guy with like, you know, three or four editors in the back"
447.78,449.94," goes, we're going to get that guy."
449.94,452.02," So it's like, turns into a high speed barge."
452.02,453.86," I just trying to track down the guy who is, uh,"
453.86,455.62," oh, we should try to get the license plate numbers."
455.62,457.21999999999997, So we can like call it into the cops.
457.21999999999997,458.97999999999996, The Atlanta justice.
458.97999999999996,460.65999999999997," Telling you, definitely don't mess you Texas."
460.65999999999997,463.53999999999996," Yeah, I remember, uh, first time I ever went there when I, uh,"
463.53999999999996,466.74," for some pressing and I went, uh, to check into the hotel and"
466.74,469.21999999999997, those assign on the hotel thing.
469.21999999999997,471.86," That was like, I, I guess this is probably common to you, Robert,"
471.86,474.82," but for me, it was like, there was a sign right on the fucking"
474.82,477.78000000000003," Hilton hotel, whatever I was staying at and it was like,"
477.78000000000003,479.94," well, it was probably like a double tree, not a Hilton."
479.94,484.34000000000003," But it said, uh, you know, no firearms allowed in the house."
484.34000000000003,486.18," Like, they have to put a sign out for that."
486.18,489.3," They're like, so many people come in with guns."
489.3,490.26, They had to put a sign out.
490.26,492.1," That actually is sticking point because you know, uh,"
492.1,494.90000000000003, you're allowed to carry a concealed handgun in Texas.
494.90000000000003,497.7, So it's like annoying for a lot of people who do carry a gun around
497.7,500.42," and holster that you got to like, you know, leave it in your car,"
500.42,501.7, if you're going into the mall.
501.7,503.7," Damn, because what if you need your gun in the mall?"
503.7,504.18, That is.
504.18,504.82," Yeah, you might."
504.82,506.02000000000004," Yeah, you know, the art is on the balcony."
506.02000000000004,508.5," Perfectly how tells us, don't bring your bomb in."
508.5,508.98, Yeah.
508.98,512.02," You, uh, I think you can bring your bomb in."
512.02,513.22," No, they just have them there."
513.22,515.0600000000001, Just don't spill the bomb water or a jar of water.
515.0600000000001,515.78, Just do that drink in.
515.78,517.0600000000001," Just, you know, don't blow garbage."
517.0600000000001,517.78, Just do that.
517.78,519.54, That diverted to the story.
519.54,520.82," I mean, I don't know, like, privately,"
520.82,522.66," I told Robert, but the story about, uh,"
522.66,524.9, at least on the podcast about the rainbow six event.
525.62,526.66," No, no, thank you."
526.66,527.14, Back in the van.
527.86,529.86," Oh, no, no, I, I think you did mention the story."
530.02,531.46, This word telling is worth telling.
531.46,532.26, I tell it again.
532.26,533.0600000000001, So it's a fast.
533.0600000000001,535.78," For Rainbow Six event over at the Embarked Daryl, uh,"
535.78,538.42," Ubisoft put together a thing where they brought up some, uh,"
538.42,540.1, SWAT members from Southern California.
540.82,544.66," Um, they suited us all up in SWAT gear, you know,"
544.66,547.86," with mass, uh, vests and everything communication headsets."
547.86,550.5," Gave us, uh, model MP5s, but they were, you know,"
550.5,553.86, the Japanese sort that you get there that are like 100% accurate looking.
553.86,556.26," Um, they just fire pellets instead."
556.26,559.62," And then we're suited up and they gave us some basic training for,"
559.62,562.74," you know, group movement and stuff, how to clear room in this and that."
562.74,567.0600000000001, And then we were to get in this unmarked van with black and windows and drive across the
567.0600000000001,571.86, Embarked Daryl to some of the vacant buildings where they had staged and they had people playing
571.86,573.86, bad guys that we were supposed to shoot there.
573.86,576.66," And we're supposed to, you know, we're asking some hostage or something."
576.66,580.34," But so, and the course of this, as we're driving over and this was,"
581.46,584.1," this was a year after, um, 911."
584.1,588.1," So that, that's important for the environment and I mean, for the, for the context of the story"
588.1,591.0600000000001," in the way that, you know, moods and anxieties were."
591.0600000000001,596.1800000000001, And so as we're driving in this unmarked van across the area of pop pulls us over.
596.1800000000001,596.9, Oh my god.
596.9,597.94," And meanwhile, we're in the back."
597.94,600.98, Here's about six of us in the back and we're all suited up in this.
600.98,604.34, We have the every five over across our chest.
604.34,607.5400000000001," And the guy driving the van is like, you know, in the same outfit as well."
608.5,613.46," So we get pulled over and immediately I ripped the mask off and I put the thing on the,"
613.46,617.78," the gun on the ground, I'm like, everyone, if you have like a brain cell and your fucking head,"
617.86,620.3399999999999, take that shit off and set it on the floor now.
620.3399999999999,623.38," Because if that guy opens the back of this truck,"
623.38,624.02, oh my god.
624.02,627.22, So he does not know what the hell's going on.
627.22,628.5," He's gonna, yeah."
628.5,630.26," Yeah, I'm like, that's not gonna be pretty."
630.26,634.8199999999999," So he was talking to, you know, of course, um, to the guy driving."
634.8199999999999,638.9," And since he was swat, he was, you know, very expert at what he did."
638.9,641.6999999999999," He knew how to speak to, you know, another law enforcement."
641.6999999999999,643.38, The guy driving was actually really a swat.
643.38,644.02, He really was.
644.02,644.5," Oh, yeah."
644.5,645.54, And so bad.
645.86,649.9399999999999," He was saying, yes, but of course, he was fully suited in this assault gear."
649.9399999999999,654.3399999999999," So he's like, you know, to get my ID and to get, you know, the paperwork, you know, this is"
654.3399999999999,656.42," an, a video game industry event."
656.42,660.5," It involves, you know, mock fire arms and all this stuff to get my ID, I'm going to need to"
660.5,661.86, reach out to my stuff.
661.86,664.9," And the guy at the cop was so like, oh, yeah."
666.9,670.18," And so he like, there, you know, he, of course, very slowly pulls, you know,"
670.18,672.42, gets his ID out and shows the paperwork and stuff.
673.06,676.5799999999999," I guess he must have read a note that said, there's a bunch of dipshits in the bag here"
676.5799999999999,678.3399999999999, because he didn't be here.
678.3399999999999,679.78," Oh, don't please."
679.78,680.9799999999999, Don't shoot him with your real gun.
680.9799999999999,685.6999999999999," They should have so fucked with you that the driver and the cop kind of like,"
685.6999999999999,687.54, past some little nut like that's fucked with these.
687.54,690.8199999999999, It was anticlimactic because then we go for the raid in the building.
690.8199999999999,691.78, And we were already keyed up.
691.78,694.5799999999999," And it was like, of course, running around at that point now with the, with the"
694.5799999999999,697.4599999999999, actors and stuff wasn't getting me into the real side of the minute.
697.4599999999999,698.5," And it's like, yeah."
698.58,699.62, Yeah.
699.62,700.58, Yeah.
700.58,704.1, You guys should have gotten out and like surrounded the cop with your gun.
704.1,705.14, That would have read.
705.14,707.78," That would have been a piece of, the pitomized wisdom."
707.78,709.78, Mm-hmm.
709.78,713.62," So in case it's not obvious, we came down here with kind of no agenda."
713.62,714.26, Yeah.
714.26,717.86, We've got to have a lot of games though.
717.86,718.82, But we have.
718.82,721.38, We came down to agenda one because we are on Devine too.
721.38,723.3, Because we've all been playing a lot of stuff.
723.3,726.5, So we didn't have to make any kind of artificial list this time.
726.5,727.7, Mm-hmm.
727.7800000000001,729.7, So like what had we been playing?
729.7,731.38, What do you been playing Mr. Robert Ashley?
732.1800000000001,735.5400000000001," Uh, I was playing some team fortress to with Sean last night actually."
736.1,738.82, And I've been playing a lot of Halo and skate.
739.5400000000001,740.1800000000001, Skate.
740.1800000000001,741.1400000000001, Skate.
741.1400000000001,743.62, Skate the game that has the period in front of it.
744.1800000000001,746.4200000000001, I think it has a period after it.
746.4200000000001,747.7," Oh, skate period?"
747.7,749.1400000000001, See the clarity of something.
749.1400000000001,749.7, Yeah.
749.7,750.4200000000001, Only kind of it.
750.4200000000001,751.1400000000001, It became interesting.
751.1400000000001,752.1800000000001, It was period of skate.
752.1800000000001,752.4200000000001, Yeah.
752.4200000000001,753.46, That's what I thought it was.
753.46,754.6600000000001, It's a period.
754.6600000000001,757.62," It's a, it's a cool game if you ever wanted to be"
757.86,759.0600000000001, a real skateboarder.
759.0600000000001,760.34, I was a terrible skateboarder.
760.9,762.5, But so it's like a skateboarding sim.
763.0600000000001,763.46, Yeah.
763.46,765.86, It's like the Gran Turismo of skateboarding I guess.
765.86,766.66, Yeah.
767.46,767.86, Okay.
769.46,770.9, That's supposed to be off here.
770.9,771.86, It's good.
771.86,772.9, Actually actually it's actually just got a fun.
772.9,775.3, It's not like the 20-hawk games where like do like button
775.3,777.3, mashing and combos and stuff is actually like
777.94,778.18, Yeah.
778.18,781.22," So on the cycle at the street level, the camera."
781.22,782.1, That's the one.
782.1,787.0600000000001," It focuses on your feet and and uh, and you're just sort of let loose on this big city."
788.58,790.5," And yeah, it's it's really cool."
790.5,791.7, It's pretty difficult.
791.7,793.38, Like the people who are really good blow my mind.
793.38,794.9, But like you gotta be alive.
794.9,795.7, I'm not that good.
795.7,797.46," You gotta wonder if Tony Hawk and uh,"
797.46,800.98, in Bamajare and all them are like playing more skate than they're playing fair game.
800.98,801.94, I'm sure.
801.94,802.42, I'm sure.
802.42,804.74, It makes Tony Hawk a prettier day.
804.74,808.5," That's one of those games like if if we if it had come out when we were still kids,"
809.22,812.82," it would have just been the most insane shit ever because I mean how many of us like,"
812.82,814.66, I mean at least you you said you tried skating.
814.66,815.0600000000001, Yeah.
815.38,819.6999999999999, I mean we're all about 720 TNC surf when that came out for Nintendo.
819.6999999999999,820.5, Skate or duh.
820.5,823.6999999999999," And you couldn't get yeah, you couldn't get further away from skating then."
823.6999999999999,827.38," You know, 720 was an arcade was much better than like TNC and Skate or DIF,"
827.38,830.3399999999999," but like yeah, even at that point it was ridiculous."
830.3399999999999,833.54, I mean there was like the game where they sent in the bees to kill you when they want more
833.54,834.02, quarters.
836.02,839.54, I would have played any game with a skateboard and I was a kid like any game.
840.26,842.66, Did you play back to the future on the NES?
842.66,844.66, I did play back to the future on the NES.
845.38,846.02, Okay.
846.02,846.42, Yeah.
846.42,848.0999999999999, Was that a skateboarding in?
848.0999999999999,848.9," Of course, man."
848.9,849.2199999999999, Yeah.
849.2199999999999,850.9, It might even quite skateboarded.
850.9,851.54, You're right.
851.54,853.6999999999999," I know, but it's a very terrible game."
853.6999999999999,855.38, It's so authentic though now.
855.38,860.3399999999999, Like I mean those games the board would look like a popsicle stick with roller skate wheels on it.
860.3399999999999,862.7399999999999," You know, but we still played it because that's all there was."
863.3,865.54, But back then that did seem realistic.
865.54,866.42, But it wasn't though.
866.42,868.5," No, for you, Joe, I'm not I'm talking about like 80s."
868.5,870.5," I'm not talking about the, uh, okay."
870.5,871.3, What?
871.3,872.5799999999999," Like, like, 40s."
872.5799999999999,873.54," No, like the 70s."
874.5,877.6999999999999," The 70s scene, like, you know, around Venice Beach stuff, you know, dark town."
878.74,885.4599999999999," So I mean, it just, it wasn't, it wasn't true to what anyone was doing, but we still wanted it."
885.4599999999999,889.86," Nowadays, it's like, I mean, it's the actual skaters themselves are in the things and stuff."
889.86,893.06," No, but yeah, that's kind of my only problem with that game."
893.06,898.0999999999999," Those, it's like the marketing inside of it is just really annoying."
898.0999999999999,898.3399999999999," Oh, yeah."
898.3399999999999,901.6999999999999," Every time you listen to it, every time you meet a new real skater,"
901.7800000000001,904.98, they like zoom in on his shoes and like really.
904.98,906.1, It's their clothes.
906.1,910.0200000000001," Yeah, and like tell you the brands of every, like, component are like,"
910.0200000000001,912.0200000000001," that's all important for teenagers, though, man."
912.0200000000001,914.34," I mean, because, you know, you want to wear like,"
914.34,916.82," power for all to gear and you wouldn't be caught dead with, uh,"
917.7,921.3000000000001," well, like, a comma, cause you know, your wrong went to Costco or something and brought back a comma,"
921.3000000000001,925.3000000000001," cause you remember, and then the next 10 minutes later, you go skate with your friends and so"
925.3000000000001,926.98," it's like, oh, why don't I be a skater?"
926.98,928.1," Oh, why don't I be a skater?"
928.1,930.9000000000001," You got to come a cause because you can't afford a gator or like,"
932.6600000000001,935.3000000000001," randomly, that's how that should be."
935.3000000000001,936.1, Isn't that area?
936.1,937.7800000000001," I mean, not that area, but that age group."
937.7800000000001,941.0600000000001," It's very much as about, are you signifying what the right,"
941.0600000000001,944.1800000000001, is the triangle on the back of her guest jeans upside down?
944.1800000000001,945.86, Does it mean it's from the swap meet?
945.86,946.26, Yeah.
946.26,948.1800000000001," And then from Mexico or something, you know?"
949.7,953.94," So kids see that and they're like, true, those are those are my, my dogs he's wearing."
954.5,955.86," I'm like, I'm trying to get those pants."
955.86,959.5400000000001, So you think that in skate that the kids playing at our actually think in that school?
959.5400000000001,960.58, I think so.
960.58,964.9000000000001," Yeah, kids imagine you're between eight and say like 16 or something?"
964.9000000000001,965.62, Mm-hmm.
965.62,966.1, Yeah.
966.1,967.5400000000001," Yeah, you're probably right, actually."
967.5400000000001,968.1, Yeah.
968.1,971.22," I mean, to us now, I hope it looks a little crisp, but if it doesn't take full."
971.22,973.22," I mean, I could feel like the color."
973.22,975.38," I think it was like, wow, gear, you'd be all in no it."
976.1800000000001,979.86," If they like it, if they zoomed in on like some, you know,"
979.86,980.98, more like a lot of signals.
980.98,982.58, That is a 25.
984.58,986.26," That's some legendary sneakers, yeah."
986.26,990.4200000000001, I just think it's weird that they zoom in on like the trucks on the skate
990.42,994.8199999999999," board. I mean, I can see like shoes and clothes, but when they, when they're going into like the"
994.8199999999999,999.86," detail of the little bits of hardware that they've all, you know, bought advertising for in the"
999.86,1000.86, bearings.
1000.86,1001.86," Yeah, it's weird."
1001.86,1002.86, Yeah.
1002.86,1005.86," Okay, there aren bearings, but still they're not legit."
1005.86,1007.86, That's for the sequel.
1007.86,1012.5799999999999," Man, I got a no kind of bearings this guy's got actually, that's the 500 point"
1012.5799999999999,1014.42, down little content pack coming down.
1014.42,1015.42, Yeah.
1015.42,1016.42, Yeah.
1016.42,1018.42, So is it all the consoles 360?
1018.42,1019.42, Yeah.
1019.42,1021.9799999999999," It's PS3 and 360, but I've only played it on 360."
1021.9799999999999,1025.26," There's six, you want to play the 360 version for the downloadable content."
1025.26,1026.26," Of course, right?"
1026.26,1027.26, Doesn't use six access.
1027.26,1031.8999999999999," So you can, you know, you can just like get on there and put in like skate around with your friends,"
1031.8999999999999,1032.8999999999999, which is fun.
1032.8999999999999,1036.02," Like I'm way into like co-op stuff right now and I don't play, I don't play that game for"
1036.02,1040.18," points, you know, I just want to skate around like, like I wouldn't real life if I didn't suck."
1040.18,1044.42, So I broke multiple arms that way and that was the end.
1044.42,1045.42, Yeah.
1045.42,1046.42," I for really, really."
1046.42,1047.42, Yeah.
1047.42,1048.42, I do.
1048.42,1054.42," I just do and stupid like piss and stuff just all these and crap and after the second one,"
1054.42,1055.42," I was like, yeah."
1055.42,1058.42," Well, the atmosphere quit, but I'm not going to play it."
1058.42,1059.42, Yeah.
1059.42,1060.42, Right.
1060.42,1061.42, Right.
1061.42,1062.42, I could barely poke a ball.
1062.42,1065.42, I played the first Tony Hawk.
1065.42,1066.42, That was good.
1066.42,1069.42, Tony Hawk was a year of my college experience.
1069.42,1070.42, Really?
1070.42,1071.42, Yeah.
1071.42,1072.42, How's your GPA that year then?
1072.42,1075.42," It was, it was pretty good, but I was an English major."
1075.42,1077.42," It was like, it was a part time job."
1077.42,1079.42, Tony Hawk was my reals.
1079.42,1080.42," You know, cool."
1080.42,1086.42, And me and my roommates just sat in our apartment playing that game for hours and hours.
1086.42,1088.42, It was insanely stupid.
1088.42,1090.42, I would love to go back and reclaim those at that.
1090.42,1095.74," I'm so glad that the one one thing about being older is that, you know, when we"
1095.74,1100.9," wanted to goof off with games, we had to like leave the dorm and go to the pinball arcade"
1100.9,1101.9, to then blow our mind.
1101.9,1103.9, And then it cost a quarter to time.
1103.9,1106.66, And then you had to make effort to lose that much time.
1106.66,1109.5, And then you were confined by how much money you had.
1109.5,1113.9," If I had a frickin' video game system in my room, cheese, I'd still be there."
1113.9,1116.9, I'd like for a year to 20 seconds of my BA.
1116.9,1120.9," I swear, I'm gonna graduate this five more credits."
1120.9,1123.9," I got 10 degrees at this point, but yeah."
1123.9,1124.9, Yeah.
1124.9,1129.9," The willpower, especially at that age, I would think, to like turn the shit off and do your work."
1129.9,1131.9, We got damp with no parents around.
1131.9,1137.9," Luckily, luckily, I had to move into the dorms, my second year in college, and I had the most"
1137.9,1140.9, nightmare remade ever.
1140.9,1141.9, His name was Mike Gresham.
1141.9,1144.9," If he's at it, he's not."
1144.9,1145.9, Why did that make him a laugh?
1145.9,1147.9, Because it was called out to a game.
1147.9,1148.9, When you say about my name.
1148.9,1154.9," But I think, but the reason I say is because I remember certain names from like my youth."
1154.9,1158.9," And sometimes when you just say the name, like that's enough to make it laugh."
1158.9,1160.9, I just laughed that he had no discretion in that.
1160.9,1163.9," I gave it fucking, Sarmiento."
1163.9,1167.9," And it's like, there's like, oh, there's some."
1167.9,1169.9, This guy was amazing though.
1169.9,1176.9," He was a really, really hardcore Christian and would actually pray for me at night like out loud while he was laying in bed."
1176.9,1178.9, Like pray for my salvation.
1178.9,1180.9," Obviously, it didn't know good."
1180.9,1182.9, It did know good.
1182.9,1187.9," And yeah, he was just always in our apartment or in our dorm room."
1187.9,1193.9," And he would always like, you know, blow his nose into clean acts and leave the clean acts on the ground."
1193.9,1194.9, I'll over the place.
1194.9,1197.9," And his like little like, you know, stained underwear."
1197.9,1200.9," Oh, it was disgusting."
1200.9,1201.9, It was disgusting.
1201.9,1203.9, I stayed at the library so much that year.
1203.9,1204.9, It was awesome.
1204.9,1207.9, Like I studied more than I'd ever studied in my entire life.
1207.9,1209.9," So, dude, don't be hit on it."
1209.9,1210.9," Yeah, we could go off."
1210.9,1212.9, We're called a roommate.
1212.9,1213.9, Sorry.
1213.9,1215.9, We just gone through the story.
1215.9,1217.9," And it was something that like, find and dooky drawers in people's houses."
1217.9,1219.9, I got a lot of stories about that.
1219.9,1220.9, I lost the story.
1220.9,1221.9, I got a lot of stories.
1221.9,1222.9," Oh, my god."
1222.9,1223.9, You're trying to go through the people's underwear drawers.
1223.9,1224.9," No, it was your finding."
1224.9,1225.9, I need to get a laugh.
1225.9,1227.9, When they're hanging up on the shower thing to dry or something.
1227.9,1229.9, And then the other time.
1229.9,1233.9," Well, okay, how do you have multiple stories in there to connect it, too?"
1233.9,1234.9," Okay, so one, it's a 10,000."
1234.9,1236.9," And they both involve, they always involve siblings."
1236.9,1240.9," So, these one brothers, Jerry and Larry, their mother's name was Mary."
1240.9,1242.9, That's no joke.
1242.9,1243.9, So we're over there.
1243.9,1246.9," And, being this other kid Jason or there, and he goes to use a bathroom."
1246.9,1249.9," He comes running out holding these, like, underwear."
1249.9,1251.9," And they got like a big, you know, skid mark on them."
1251.9,1253.9, And he's just laughing and screaming.
1253.9,1255.9," And he's like, you should your pants."
1255.9,1258.9," And then Jerry was like, those are my moms."
1258.9,1260.9, Leave my mom's stuff alone.
1260.9,1263.9, But they're very clearly like men's tidy.
1263.9,1266.9," Why do you say, you know, it's like a, the shlong, a hole in the front."
1266.9,1270.9," And, and, and, there's no other vent to cut that story quick."
1270.9,1273.26," Basically, that was like humiliating for him."
1273.26,1276.9," But then the next year, Jason had had two brothers."
1276.9,1280.9, He had to twin brother and have Shane and then his little brother Trevor.
1280.9,1284.9, And they would always have this situation where one of the older brothers would share room with the younger one.
1284.9,1287.9, Or they'd switch to the two older brothers had one.
1287.9,1293.9," And during one of these phases, we went over to help move the furniture from one of their rooms into another."
1293.9,1299.38, And we pull out the dresser to take to the other room and down behind there's like a stack of shit
1299.38,1301.3000000000002, The other way and immediately
1301.3000000000002,1305.5, Just start screaming laughing and he's like dude those are trevers
1306.5,1311.66," And then Trevor the little brother picks one up, but it's all like total like Trevor was like six years younger"
1311.66,1312.66," You know, he's like these are mine"
1315.1000000000001,1317.1000000000001, Those are the guys when
1317.1000000000001,1319.74, When I talked about skin farting where like you do that
1319.74,1321.74, It's uh
1321.74,1329.3, Because actually there's one time we went camping and we had like this big Sun T jar like a wide mouth and we loaded that up with gas and then when when
1329.94,1333.7, When I went to sleep like you could put the whole the mouth was so wide
1333.7,1337.74," My bottle. Oh no, you could put it all straight over his like nose and eyes mouth"
1337.74,1343.58, I just want to have a pain of picture for listeners at 12. It's back there and five of us are like holding our head to
1343.58,1345.58, And this conversation
1350.58,1352.58," Okay, the final two more stories"
1353.58,1361.58, These were good kids they had this shitty Saint Bernard and like their whole yard was nothing but like a Saint Bernard mud pie because of the thing
1361.58,1364.04," But inside their house, I swear there's so much"
1364.3,1369.4199999999998, Shedded Saint Bernard here that if you started in a corner and you started peeling up the layer
1369.42,1376.1000000000001, You could have pulled out the floor plan of their fucking apartment of your house made in Saint Bernard hair and it's laid it out in the street
1376.7,1381.3400000000001," Wow, I know they do house and this is no this is a family that in the dead made dinner one time"
1381.3400000000001,1389.54, We all sat down Jason comes up to the table after it set pulls the sweat pants down and backs his cheeks up onto the table and farts across the meal
1389.94,1392.3400000000001, That the dad had just prepared and set down
1392.94,1398.4," And we're already already sitting there waiting to eat you know, and then just pulls the pants back up sits down and grabs his for"
1400.42,1402.42, I'm not
1406.42,1410.7," I grew up in quite a few places, but this is all in lakesides like east"
1410.7,1412.7, Did it involve a trailer park?
1412.7,1414.7, Definitely
1416.7,1421.44, They definitely did sweet that was just not what my family meals were like
1422.7,1424.7, So games team for the hour
1425.98,1428.6200000000001, Team for justice is I say we talk about that because
1428.78,1430.78, Ryan has got a confession
1431.82,1437.6599999999999, I know you played it Jeff and Sean's play little Darren's played and and Robert was introduced to it last night
1437.6599999999999,1444.26," But really the big news I think here is Ryan that's here Ryan yeah, then playing the hell out of team fortress two for the past"
1445.5,1447.6999999999998," Four or five days yeah, how many hours of your life?"
1447.6999999999998,1450.1399999999999, Let's say it was so little drama man. You need it like yes
1450.1399999999999,1453.9799999999998, The guy who never plays first person shoot right this is this is a dramatic turning point
1453.98,1458.34, Who refused to play bio shock as it's a first person shooter right to give did you play the half-on
1458.34,1459.82, He just made a proof-a
1460.98,1466.54," He just said say yeah, to you play the half-lives now so this is significant. I played doom two"
1466.98,1468.98," Okay, so what what got you to do this?"
1469.6200000000001,1476.14," Well, I just I got curious enough to try it. I've you know watching Sean play for a while and one of our computers here and"
1477.66,1483.18, And it up like what got you curious though. I'm curious you just looked cool. I like the arts like the cartoons
1483.18,1485.18, Yeah
1486.6200000000001,1491.5800000000002, You know Sean was telling me about just how some of the classes worked and you know I don't like the aim and shooters
1492.14,1494.14, Because I saw
1494.14,1498.54, That's why I like Metroid Prime because you have a lock-on and you can lock on an amazing shoot
1498.54,1503.42, And you don't have to be good so there are classes for you and team for there are there's you know
1503.42,1510.22," There's a there's a home for you. You know like the medic, you know you gone in his proton pack totally you don't got to aim with him"
1511.18,1514.9, And then in the age in here you build turrets. They aim for you
1515.9,1521.6200000000001, I wrote heavy weapons guy yet a few more classes were made for people who liked to hold a button down and get points
1523.22,1525.22, He says with no
1525.22,1527.22, So no attitude whatsoever
1528.9,1532.5, Is this step one and you becoming an all together new man?
1533.1000000000001,1538.18," No, I don't think so you're not gonna be like on the pickup artist next season"
1539.14,1541.94, You're not gonna turn it all around beauty in the gig
1542.42,1550.0800000000002," No, all right, so this is this game simple. This isn't like super complex that's like part of the success of this game"
1550.0800000000002,1554.68, I mean everyone wants to play it and I mean before we came in we were just talking about similarities between
1554.94,1557.74, You know when you know Robert when you hear me talk about this game
1557.74,1563.74, How much it sounds like someone talking about fighting games or something and Ryan you've been saying the same but set for MMO
1563.74,1569.94, We're bitching about nerves and buffs and stuff and when we rage quit when we can't handle like a pyrogating too many subsequent
1569.94,1570.94, I mean
1570.94,1573.66," Yeah, I critical hits or something yeah, like you did the other night"
1574.3,1579.16," Yeah, because like what but what they did here though is instead of like you know going for increasing complexity like"
1579.46,1583.54, Which is almost always the trend and at some point that was in the plans for team for it
1583.54,1589.18, You're just putting it from Mandarin all these other things. It's just like make it you know as complicated as you can
1589.18,1592.78, I mean they actually did the opposite and said like let's make it
1592.78,1598.3, You know more simplistic than team for chess class even and it's work and especially for I mean
1598.3,1600.54, I'll talk about mine later. I'll let Ryan continue
1600.54,1607.06, But like apparently right Ryan you don't you feel like you can get in it like you're saying and have a good time and feel like you're still doing something
1607.06,1613.86," Yeah, I think this is an important public service we can provide here by having Ryan talk about you know"
1613.86,1618.42, The fact that you were able to get into it so easily because I think it's still probably a lot of people's big fear
1618.94,1624.24, Is that I can't play this multiplayer shooter because I will go in and get my ass kicked and not have fun
1624.52,1627.3400000000001," Right, right? You think that that's still probably the bias?"
1627.74,1631.46, It's holy is like like if you're gonna play you'll counter strike or something
1631.6200000000001,1636.9, Right and go in there and expect to get shot the head and spend three minutes watching the team members that know how to play right
1636.9,1639.0600000000002, We've been Halo right same deal
1639.0600000000002,1643.26," Go and get your ass kicked on yeah, not to the extent of counter strike"
1643.26,1645.9," No, right because of the right system"
1645.9,1647.5400000000002, But you got like a quick war is coming out
1648.1000000000001,1653.94," That's come out today, right? But yeah, but yeah, but but you're not you didn't feel this even from the start Ryan that"
1655.1000000000001,1657.94, That it was us too overwhelming to get into and you it
1659.3400000000001,1663.98," It doesn't seem like it to me. I mean there's super really really good people on there, but"
1665.5400000000002,1670.26, Doing what you're doing the fact that you're you're not at the bottom of the point later
1670.7,1674.5400000000002," You're not dying every second. I mean, especially when you start off as the medic"
1674.54,1679.22, I'd say that's a great way to learn because you heal yourself when you heal an ally
1679.62,1684.1, I didn't realize that and if you team up with someone who's you know a powerhouse or who's you know
1684.86,1686.86, playing you know very well
1687.02,1695.18, You'll keep you protected for the most part is that your main class right now is medic the one that I've clocked more time with the most time with his engineer
1696.02,1698.26, And in medic is a close second
1699.42,1701.42, Sean show me the engineer tricks
1701.94,1709.0600000000002," Can you see getting into one of the like soldier or scout classes? No, I went through and tried all the other classes and those the dudes"
1709.0600000000002,1711.5800000000002, You know the big twitch classes like the soldier and scouting all that
1712.26,1716.14," Does not for me not for Ryan, but you could do pyro and heavy weapons, though"
1716.14,1719.74," I didn't like the heavy. There is too slow. Yeah, that's the"
1720.54,1724.0600000000002, It's funny because you know for the for the rage quit and like right now
1724.26,1725.74, They just
1725.82,1731.42, Buffed the pyro and that pisses you off because the way the thing works is like okay
1731.42,1734.86, He's he's kind of like the new medic and so far as instead of infection
1735.1,1740.06, That's gonna continue to sap your healthy sets going fire you do have to run the water find a medic or find
1740.22,1745.46," You know a health power up on the ground, which is fine just totally cool makes sense. We're gonna have a pyro right"
1745.66,1748.38, But in addition to that now the
1748.94,1755.74, Deflame direct flame damage does is just massive enough to kill any class and like a second of sustained fire
1756.3000000000002,1760.8600000000001, And I don't know I think maybe they should dial it back a little so he has to be even you know
1760.8600000000001,1764.8600000000001, The range on it because he's got pretty good range for that and just those things together
1764.8600000000001,1768.8600000000001, I mean you just see hold you know when you see half of a team is one class
1769.66,1773.9, This sounds like an MMO nerve kind of thing because that the the first week when it came out
1773.9,1778.3000000000002, I remember being on servers where everybody was complaining about that the pyro's were two
1778.38,1780.94, Week right and then it's gonna go the and that's right
1780.94,1785.98, Just like foot about so right now someone's listening so when you play as pyro and who loves it and he's like oh shut the hell up
1785.98,1787.98, Shut the hell up. He's perfect
1788.3000000000002,1792.6200000000001, It's funny you'll you look at the steam-powered forms and the threads are just full of like one of them is hilarious
1792.6200000000001,1797.5, It's a awesome joke post and it's someone started a thread and it and it seemed as if
1797.98,1801.5," Well actually it reads the whole thing is ironic though, but it's like you know"
1801.5,1807.0200000000002, I can't believe they messed up my pyro. I want to be able to do this and it's like he's saying he expects to have this beat of a scout
1807.18,1810.7, He expects to be able to like instantly and generate people
1811.9,1816.06," From like 20 feet away and all these other things, you know, and then people got in there to say like well"
1816.54,1818.54, I don't know that's a little too much
1819.58,1824.22," Ridiculous, but yeah, it's always like that. I mean, I'm sure they're gonna they're gonna have a hard time"
1825.02,1830.3799999999999," Pleasing everyone and just getting that balance, but then it's something they can continue to tweak those variables all the time"
1830.3799999999999,1832.94, I mean I know a lot of a serpist it scouts
1833.5,1837.5800000000002," Some of it comes from the difference. I mean the experience with team fortress classic too, so like"
1838.06,1842.7, Seeing a scout kill you sometimes they can get a critical hit on you and kill you in a single shotgun blast
1843.1000000000001,1846.22, At close range and it's like that's just wild like that
1846.6200000000001,1849.66, That should not be possible. How is the scout gonna kill a soldier
1850.22,1855.98, That rapidly and so that's kind of hard to deal with but the other thing is I'm really I don't I think the critical
1855.98,1860.54, The notion of a critical hit it's definitely there for like Ryan and stuff in some way. I mean
1860.7,1863.26, Does that what does that mean what it means to them to the game?
1863.8999999999999,1866.7, When you're firing at someone on a di-roll
1867.34,1870.46, You that and they're loaded dice because you know
1871.02,1875.8999999999999, The better you do the more likely you're supposed to get critical. That's the way that I heard it was set up last
1875.98,1881.26, I just didn't even know there were died and it just massively doubles it just multiplies the damage you do
1881.26,1885.42, But it's like in a game of skill and a competitive skill game to just start throwing that kind of like
1886.1399999999999,1890.46, Randomness in there. That's you said anathema to people that take this shit seriously
1890.54,1896.1399999999999, I think you know and it's great when you get one you're like hey I just killed that guy one shot because I got a critical on it
1896.22,1901.42, But then when you're getting hit like a pyro gets a string of critical flame on you and you're just
1901.58,1907.5, Your song it's random it is yeah. I mean there's it's it's random with certain slants on it
1908.1399999999999,1913.02, So that's why I mean like loaded die would be the best analogy to come up in certain ways so
1913.82,1918.86, Originally when you look at the commentary mode what it says is that when you're doing really well it'll
1919.82,1926.62, If it'll favor you you're likelihood of getting critical hits and the reason they do this is because to give everyone a sense of the experience
1926.62,1928.62, What it's like to be on a really good run
1928.9399999999998,1935.1799999999998, That a that a genuinely good player will get on where you just feel untouchable for the moment and then you just continue to get better
1935.1799999999998,1938.78, Because you're not worried you're like okay at this point. I'm not concerned. I'm not stressed
1938.78,1943.82, I'm just like owning this game and so it's like to kind of like artificially generate that kind of moment
1943.82,1949.1, So wait do you have is that one of the criteria for getting a critical hit because you have to already be on a role?
1949.1799999999998,1953.98, Or you can you still have a likely it's all just percentages anyone can get one any time you just start the game
1954.1399999999999,1956.1399999999999, You've always got a chance of hitting one
1956.3799999999999,1961.8999999999999," Okay, but it's just like how frequently because sometimes you can get a bunch in a row and do other variables matter like"
1962.62,1968.06, Your aim or your position or how close they are. I don't I don't know the I haven't seen like you know the
1968.3,1970.3, Some of those things where we need on someone to post the code
1971.02,1974.7, Right a steam-powered forms and we could look it just how but I mean yeah
1975.02,1976.78," Some way what you guys think of it, but I mean"
1976.78,1983.26, I'm sure I would think if it if it did involve any of those things that that would be fair if it was like a hundred percent random
1983.6599999999999,1986.46, That just would strike me as weird like it's
1987.26,1989.58, It's in there like what about what about the sniper?
1989.58,1993.4199999999998, You know with a sniper scope does he he can get critical every clasking it critical
1993.8999999999999,1999.26, With every weapon they have the medic medic can get an critical heal or what how would I?
1999.26,2002.94," I don't know he's got a yeah, hi-padermic gun in a bone saw"
2004.3,2008.62," Yeah, a bone saw yeah, it's like a surgeon's"
2009.74,2011.74, Swings around it's powerful
2012.06,2013.74, Because it's been everybody's main game
2014.78,2021.74," It has been yeah for me the one game on that reviewing so yeah, yeah, it's too a bad extent because"

2095.2599999999998,2098.78, I mean about stuff you've been playing but later I do want to say something about it because it was like
2099.58,2106.78, Really really fun. Shamaloe are you mostly playing TFT? There was a TFT and then well a non PC game so I want to oh I see
2107.7400000000002,2109.7400000000002," Oh, that's that's that's wow of course"

2130.3,2134.7000000000003, This is a guy called show-how and he comes from neo gaming age forums and
2135.18,2142.9399999999996, He was posting in a you know in the halo review thread so you know before the game was launched and you know people are tracking the reviews and building
2143.66,2147.74, Excitement for the game just totally cool. It's fun to do that show-ho though
2148.9399999999996,2150.9399999999996, It's a little special
2153.18,2160.9399999999996, So he he tracks he's kind of keeping a countdown. I think before a certain review went up and we start off at 15 minutes
2161.8199999999997,2163.8199999999997, This is
2163.82,2165.82," Guys, I'm scared"

2167.82,2168.82, I'm cold
2169.1800000000003,2181.7400000000002, It's all over my body the reason why I kind of three 60s come to this day the reason why I started playing the early FPS like quake and doom and wolf and dark forces and golden eye
2181.82,2185.26, It was all because of this day because of this game
2186.1400000000003,2189.98, His game will not only be the last significant game of all time
2190.22,2196.78, We're also in the game that will counter attack and kill world of warcraft and all other oh my god online
2196.78,2199.5, Fun on it. I'm red versus blue on this
2200.14,2206.46, It's going to be I can't write anymore. I can't I have to hide under my desk. I just can't
2207.7400000000002,2211.42, Just can't but so many don't understand
2211.82,2214.06, They don't understand and it's also about
2214.7,2219.5, The chanting monks about me the super soldier on a dying star
2220.06,2227.34, Following from grace with the carmini but we're in a sound track that's when it's about the pink and any palette
2227.66,2235.5, The bright colors in the strange art designs the mixer tactical only two weapon in frantic doom running gun library level
2235.82,2237.82, It all collided together
2238.78,2241.98," Okay, that's a nice pretty inspiration all"
2242.7,2247.5," Let me want to play the game. Yeah, except for the monk's part. What was that about the theme song?"
2247.82,2252.86, I like the fact that when he was playing like doom and whatever it was back when it was just some preparation for this
2252.86,2254.86," Yeah, but I was all building up"
2254.86,2257.1, He knew that he knew that somewhere in the future one day
2257.5,2260.78, When it feels like that the his his peak moment in life has passed
2260.78,2264.38," Yeah, shit that's got a softness and it now, man. There's more to it"
2264.38,2267.02," Oh, this is not right. Yeah, okay, so five minutes in"
2267.74,2269.74, He posted

2281.6600000000003,2282.7000000000003, Guys
2282.7000000000003,2286.3," Guys please don't let them give it less than halo. Two, please don't"
2286.94,2291.1800000000003, Gershman. I love you. Don't do this. I know you thought it was fun

2299.98,2301.98, I beg of you

2368.46,2371.98," Again, you have a case of someone made a joke character used it for a couple years"
2372.22,2375.18, It's continued has the count at team xbox where he was banned
2375.9,2379.9, Because I found the trail there because he was crying about how he can leave you as banned there
2380.46,2384.14," So okay, and here we go investigation the moment of truth"
2384.22,2385.18, All right
2385.18,2391.5," He was yes Gs 9.5 yes, yes, yes, that's what's important"

2402.94,2404.94, I love you Jeffie
2406.7799999999997,2410.62, Best moment in this life. It wasn't the game itself. It's a fact the game spot
2410.62,2418.7799999999997," The game is not had not gone yet, so yeah game spot gave it in as opposed to the 9.4 or which he was going to hasn't games thought shifted to"
2419.5,2421.5," increments of 0.5 by no anyway, yeah, oh"
2422.38,2424.38, Maybe this is Jeff's all to count
2424.38,2426.7," Oh, I don't know that's crazy"
2426.7,2427.66," Yes, yeah"
2427.66,2431.58," We're other people posting in between these rants. Yeah, I didn't read them because I was in a hurry"

2436.7799999999997,2442.8599999999997," Yeah, but I couldn't tell if it was for real or not I wish I could get this passion about something"
2443.74,2446.22, I can't about a game spot review just about anything
2446.62,2448.7," Yeah, nothing that in my life generates that much"
2449.98,2451.98, These shacking scared
2451.98,2454.7799999999997," Yeah, so I'm jealous and hurting all over the community"
2454.7799999999997,2458.9399999999996," Yeah, I feel cool to life this compared to this man that's like what Eccliss was about"
2459.8199999999997,2461.98," Right, that's this is exactly that this is Eccliss"

2717.6,2720.6, Altarshaltows
2720.6,2722.6, The song was made by Michael
2722.6,2724.6, You made this laugh very much
2724.6,2726.6, And we would play it
2726.6,2728.6, You got it
2728.6,2730.6, Robert hasn't heard it
2730.6,2732.6, Actually I heard it
2732.6,2734.6, I saw it on the throw with it
2734.6,2736.6, It was on my space page
2736.6,2738.6, Sorry to use it
2738.6,2740.6, Kind of a theme song
2740.6,2741.6, I didn't actually comment
2741.6,2743.6, So we got it
2743.6,2745.6, And now we're back to Halo Huncho
2745.6,2748.6, We're back to Halo
2748.6,2749.6, We have a single player
2749.6,2752.6, I've played most of the campaign on normal
2752.6,2754.6, And then a good chunk of the campaign
2754.6,2756.6, And co-op on heroic
2756.6,2760.6, I found normal in co-op to be too
2760.6,2762.6, To be close
2762.6,2764.6, I found a white man
2764.6,2768.6, I found a kind out of sync with earth's gravity
2768.6,2772.6, I thought it was like poppin that of his skull
2772.6,2774.6, So it's like an alien
2774.6,2776.6, Like a good leaf's got all
2776.6,2777.6, Here it is
2777.6,2779.6, That's the thing
2779.6,2780.6, That's the thing that's playing to you
2780.6,2781.6, I think we're doing an identity
2781.6,2782.6, Finally coming forward
2782.6,2784.6, I'm gonna have a guy
2784.6,2787.6, I'm gonna have the headphone malfunction
2787.6,2788.6, Yeah
2788.6,2790.6, The heroic in co-op
2790.6,2792.6, I'm finding it to be quite a bit
2792.6,2794.6, And maybe it's just all the way around on heroic
2794.6,2796.6, The fucking snipers around every player
2796.6,2797.6, Play it's a player
2797.6,2798.6, Yeah
2798.6,2799.6, Is it doable?
2799.6,2800.6, Because just to be noticed
2800.6,2801.6, As someone in this building
2801.6,2803.6, Said you know you're not really playing
2803.6,2804.6, The game on
2805.6,2807.6, If you're playing it on anything less in heroic
2807.6,2808.6, Yeah
2808.6,2809.6, Not really playing it
2809.6,2812.6, If you've ever played if you've even touched an FPS before
2812.6,2814.6, Yeah then you have to play it on heroic
2814.6,2815.6, What?
2815.6,2816.6, Or something like that
2816.6,2818.6, That's the animation
2818.6,2819.6, That's the word
2819.6,2820.6, I see how it is
2820.6,2822.6, Every time a Halo game comes out that's the word
2822.6,2824.6, Well now that all the
2824.6,2825.6, Excuse me
2825.6,2827.6, You can delete that up
2827.6,2828.6, Yeah
2828.6,2830.6, That's tasty
2830.6,2832.6, I don't know what to do about that
2833.6,2834.6, It's in there
2834.6,2835.6, Let's stay
2835.6,2836.6, Smells like turkey
2836.6,2837.6, If that's not edited out
2837.6,2840.6, I had two die cooks before we recorded it in it
2840.6,2842.6, That was kind of waiting low sausage
2842.6,2846.6, Sour Crout
2846.6,2848.6, Well this podcast
2848.6,2849.6, Depondgent to a halt
2851.6,2853.6, Yeah heroic mode
2853.6,2854.6, Heroic mode
2854.6,2856.6, Is I'm finding it hard
2856.6,2857.6, I know it's a story
2857.6,2859.6, After all this sort of hype is died
2859.6,2861.6, I'm finding it to be a fun shooter
2862.6,2864.6, I feel very similar to what I felt
2864.6,2865.6, Fun Halo too
2865.6,2866.6, It says Jeff Greer
2866.6,2867.6, Yep

2872.6,2873.6, Yeah that's a cool move
2873.6,2875.6, There's a couple of vehicles that I get in
2875.6,2877.6," And I'm like, well that's just one about"
2877.6,2878.6, Then I get out of it and find one
2878.6,2880.6, That's a little more familiar to me
2880.6,2882.6," They're all very, you know, he men like in appearance"
2882.6,2883.6, Out of total design
2883.6,2886.6, And the way that those levels play is is awesome
2886.6,2888.6, Because it very much
2888.6,2890.6, You might experience encourages risk taking
2890.6,2894.6, It's dynamic and unlike playing the game on her road
2894.6,2897.6, And going around you actually feel like you are heroic
2897.6,2899.6, You feel like a superhero
2899.6,2901.6, You know the master chief that everyone's talking about
2901.6,2905.6, The one that deserves to be on the can of mountain dew
2905.6,2909.6," No, for example, this would be"
2909.6,2911.6, Okay you're in a ghost or something
2911.6,2913.6, You would steal that from someone
2913.6,2914.6, And I love that mechanic
2914.6,2915.6, It's great
2915.6,2917.6, I'm surprised more people have not copied the ability to check vehicles
2917.6,2919.6, It's a great equalizer
2919.6,2921.6, Whenever the question is what happens when you give
2921.6,2923.6, Some people vehicles and others don't
2923.6,2924.6, How do you balance it?
2924.6,2925.6, It's a perfect solution
2925.6,2927.6, They deserve massive credit for that
2927.6,2928.6, Works in single player
2928.6,2930.6, Well so say you get a ghost
2930.6,2931.6, You run it up to a side of a tank
2931.6,2932.6, Jump off yours
2932.6,2933.6, Jump onto the tank
2933.6,2934.6, Stuff a grenade in there
2934.6,2935.6, Hop back off
2935.6,2936.6, Get your thing in a skate
2936.6,2937.6, But when it blows up
2937.6,2939.6, And it's just super fun and dynamic
2939.6,2941.6, And dynamic in the sense that
2941.6,2945.6," It's just characterized by you know, rapid movement"
2945.6,2947.6, And unpredictable doing this
2947.6,2949.6, And that and juicking and stuff
2949.6,2951.6, Whereas I find especially on heroic
2951.6,2954.6, The infantry combat
2954.6,2956.6, To be a grueling slog
2956.6,2958.6, That's based around the game mechanic
2958.6,2960.6, Of the regenerating shield
2960.6,2963.6, And you coming out shooting guys
2963.6,2965.6, Going back waiting for your shield
2965.6,2966.6, Retar should be next one
2966.6,2967.6, Yeah
2967.6,2969.6," And because of that too, you hear"
2969.6,2971.6, So much about the AI is so good
2971.6,2972.6, Or this or that
2972.6,2973.6, And that's another note to make
2973.6,2975.6, The AI does not change on between
2975.6,2976.6, Difficulty levels
2977.6,2979.6, Rather it may not seem more intelligent
2979.6,2980.6, And this is a good thing
2980.6,2981.6, Because it gets to live longer
2981.6,2983.6," And in general, halo"
2983.6,2984.6, Even a normal halo
2984.6,2987.6, Animis live longer than in many other games
2987.6,2988.6, And that's things for the people that really like it
2988.6,2991.6, That's like one of its strengths
2991.6,2992.6, Right
2992.6,2994.6, And I think that was my issue with playing in heroic
2994.6,2996.6, Just to go back to that for just a tangent here
2996.6,2998.6, But the broots for example
2998.6,3000.6, Take like four clips
3000.6,3001.6, I mean like four entire weapons
3001.6,3002.6, You can throw down on the ground
3002.6,3003.6, Just before they go down
3003.6,3005.6, You need to use your carbide
3005.6,3006.6, And shoot them in the head
3006.6,3007.6, Right
3007.6,3008.6, I know something you don't tell me that
3008.6,3010.6, But then the other mechanical courses
3010.6,3012.6, The psychics night being
3012.6,3013.6, Right
3013.6,3014.6, Yeah
3014.6,3016.6, You know I mean because of that
3016.6,3017.6, For back on the AI real quick
3017.6,3020.6, It's like what I mainly see in the game
3020.6,3022.6, Because of it is guys that come out
3022.6,3023.6, They're by cover
3023.6,3024.6, They kind of side step a bit
3024.6,3025.6, They make a noise
3025.6,3027.6, Sides have some more go back to cover
3027.6,3028.6, Maybe make a noise
3028.6,3030.6, And then come out and do that
3030.6,3031.6, And
3031.6,3033.6, Well you know like in
3033.6,3034.6, Some people criticize you know
3034.6,3035.6, And other games where it's like
3035.6,3037.6, Well because guys would never leave cover
3037.6,3038.6, And if they were smart
3038.6,3039.6, If they're truly smart
3039.6,3041.6, But sure but if you want to have a fun
3041.6,3042.6, In my mind
3042.6,3043.6, In this kind of game
3043.6,3044.6, This is a difference
3044.6,3045.6, It was kind of having a message board
3045.6,3046.6, Discussion
3046.6,3047.6, I kind of like came to see this about the way
3047.6,3048.6, I think
3048.6,3049.6, It is interesting you know kind of revealing
3049.6,3051.6, Is that when a playing a brother's
3051.6,3052.6, Norms are called duty
3052.6,3054.6, Like I come to expect that kind of gameplay
3054.6,3056.6, With the exception
3056.6,3057.6, And you know brothers
3057.6,3058.6, Norms of course you're always
3058.6,3060.6, You have a suppressive fire team
3060.6,3062.6, That you can rely on when you order them
3062.6,3064.6, That gives you mobility to flank
3064.6,3066.6, But in a you know in a game
3066.6,3068.6, It's like fantasy or sci-fi or something
3068.6,3070.6, I want to be able to like I want to run
3070.6,3071.6, I like sprint runs
3071.6,3073.6, Jumping around you know
3073.6,3075.6, Just kind of I like to play it in the way
3075.6,3076.6, I would multiplayer
3076.6,3077.6, You know when you play like a really like
3077.6,3079.6, To which doubt unreal or something
3079.6,3080.6, You want to play
3080.6,3082.6, And you're really taking risks
3082.6,3083.6, And sometimes it's paying off
3083.6,3084.6, And like the best possible way
3084.6,3086.6, And it's just like boom snap
3086.6,3088.6, Got this guy with a rocket boom snap
3088.6,3089.6, Got this guy
3089.6,3090.6, Whereas this is very
3090.6,3091.6, Much like you're saying
3091.6,3092.6, You know you don't want to peek your head out
3092.6,3093.6, Because you'll get shot off
3093.6,3094.6, By one of those many snipers
3094.6,3096.6, You might not have access to something
3096.6,3097.6, To counter them
3097.6,3100.6, I assume also like I'm saying single player
3100.6,3101.6, Example didn't co-op
3101.6,3103.6, Because clearly if you had a multiple
3103.6,3105.6, Help it's four player co-op too right
3105.6,3106.6, Yeah
3106.6,3107.6, So if you had quadruple the firepower
3107.6,3108.6, And someone's bound to have something
3108.6,3110.6, That they can counter sniper fire with
3110.6,3111.6, But even with two people
3111.6,3112.6, Right
3112.6,3114.6, Heroic it's tough to get those snipers
3114.6,3115.6, On your own though
3115.6,3117.6, Imagine if you had a battle right
3117.6,3119.6, I can't imagine with one clip left in it
3119.6,3120.6, And that was it
3120.6,3122.6, And everyone would only drop the tank
3122.6,3123.6, Just still
3123.6,3124.6, Yeah
3124.6,3125.6, I won't play it that way
3125.6,3127.6, Yeah I mean I already we beat it on co-op
3127.6,3129.6, And in heroic and I decided
3129.6,3132.6, If I go back to single player it wouldn't be in legendary
3132.6,3133.6, Which is like the normal next step
3133.6,3134.6, I would go back to normal
3134.6,3137.6, And just like I don't want to deal with this by myself
3137.6,3139.6, Because like you count on the ability to
3139.6,3140.6, Respawn
3140.6,3142.6, Because that's another thing that you get
3142.6,3143.6, In the co-op that you do
3143.6,3144.6, Right
3144.6,3145.6, And single player is if you're dead
3145.6,3146.6, Oh you can come back
3146.6,3147.6, Yeah you can come back
3147.6,3148.6, You just just like
3148.6,3150.6, You have to wait till the other players clear the area
3150.6,3152.6, But you do you can come back
3152.6,3153.6, You do have a you come back
3153.6,3155.6, Where your partner is
3155.6,3157.6, After they've cleared out the area a little bit
3157.6,3159.6, It is a cool mechanic
3159.6,3160.6, Did you play it on heroic?
3160.6,3161.6, What's your...
3161.6,3163.6, I played the first couple levels on heroic
3163.6,3165.6, When I first started playing it by myself
3165.6,3166.6, And I went back because of
3166.6,3167.6, Couple and getting stuck
3167.6,3169.6, Most of it the sniper thing
3169.6,3170.6, I would end up in situations where
3170.6,3172.6, I had no long range weapon
3172.6,3175.6, And I felt like I didn't know what the hell I was supposed to do
3176.6,3177.6, But I don't know
3177.6,3179.6, I don't feel like playing Halo for
3179.6,3181.6, You know a validation of my gamer skills
3181.6,3182.6, I feel like I play Halo
3182.6,3185.6, Because I want to like blow a bunch of shit up
3185.6,3186.6, Yeah
3186.6,3188.6, And that's why I want to be a part
3188.6,3189.6, You don't want to be you know
3189.6,3191.6, Have your your alleged
3191.6,3192.6, You know ability to play a game
3192.6,3193.6, But little
3193.6,3195.6, And there's so much of that like
3195.6,3196.6, Very
3196.6,3198.6, Tweenage
3198.6,3199.6, Um
3199.6,3200.6, I don't know what the word for
3200.6,3201.6, Or what he but just
3201.6,3203.6, Proving that you're good
3203.6,3205.6, Not just proving you're good
3205.6,3206.6, But proving that you're worthwhile
3206.6,3207.6, This game
3207.6,3209.6, Like you have to it's not it's kind of like
3209.6,3211.6, Like the techno Viking you know
3211.6,3213.6, He does it
3213.6,3215.6, Music dancing
3215.6,3217.6, Yeah you were the of Halo
3217.6,3218.6, Right
3218.6,3219.6, But the thing there is it's like
3219.6,3220.6, After a while
3220.6,3222.6, I see a lot of people don't counter
3222.6,3223.6, I've never heard anyone say a bad word about
3223.6,3225.6, Heroic and the only reason
3225.6,3227.6, It's not not just because we love to hate on this game
3227.6,3228.6, Whatever
3228.6,3229.6, Um
3229.6,3230.6, And I'm absolutely sincere
3230.6,3231.6, It's not just appeasement
3231.6,3233.6, When I say that those vehicles sections are phenomenal
3233.6,3234.6, Love and fantastic
3234.6,3236.6, Even the level design for the infantry combat
3236.6,3238.6, It's very clearly designed with
3238.6,3241.6, Like to provide a great range of tactical opportunity
3241.6,3242.6," Yep, yep"
3242.6,3243.6," Yep, so much is good about it"
3243.6,3246.6, But just specifically just the heroic thing
3246.6,3248.6, And the badge of honor that it's supposed to imply
3248.6,3250.6, Reminds me of you know in high school
3250.6,3252.6, Not me but you know the kids that did it
3252.6,3253.6, They smoke pot or something
3253.6,3254.6, But one of them
3254.6,3256.6, It's not enough to say you smoked a joint
3256.6,3259.6, Then the kids like well I had like a two-foot bomb
3259.6,3260.6, Then the next guys will
3260.6,3262.6, The fucker I had a six-footer
3262.6,3264.6, And then someone's like well I got this big bucket of ice
3264.6,3265.6, And a two-liter bottle
3265.6,3267.6, And I cut the bottom off of it
3267.6,3269.6, You can imagine from there
3269.6,3271.6, So it's kind of like that you know
3271.6,3273.6, It kind of becomes like you know
3273.6,3274.6, You know what I'm still argue about like
3274.6,3276.6, And we did better on the math test
3276.6,3279.6, I don't know what kind of math can't be
3279.6,3280.6, If you are hanging with it
3280.6,3282.6, Like imagine if someone would play
3282.6,3284.6, And I could see him saying wow like I hear
3284.6,3285.6, So much good about this
3285.6,3287.6, And it's pissing me off and I'm dying a lot
3287.6,3288.6, Maybe I just suck
3288.6,3291.6, People can't tell me I suck at FPS
3291.6,3292.6, It's bullshit
3292.6,3293.6, I know that I'm good
3293.6,3296.6, So it's like you cannot say well you just suck at it
3296.6,3297.6, I mean I could get through it
3297.6,3300.6, But it's not fun to me and you do die over and over again
3300.6,3302.6, And it's very interesting because you know like in the
3302.6,3305.6, Wired story the excellent white halo cover story
3305.6,3307.6, It makes such an excellent
3307.6,3310.6, Examination of the way that the game is designed
3310.6,3312.6, And balance and tested
3312.6,3315.6, Very publicly based on iterating
3315.6,3317.6, Based on feedback and continuing to iterate
3317.6,3320.6, That this is ultimately going to be a game for everyone
3320.6,3322.6, It's not the game that sells six million copies
3322.6,3324.6, Because every teenager in the country has to have it
3324.6,3326.6, To have a proper American teenage adolescents
3326.6,3328.6, You know but because they think that
3328.6,3332.6, People of all walks of life and ages are going to be having it
3332.6,3333.6, But give me a break dude
3333.6,3335.6, If me and as many of these games as I play
3335.6,3337.6, Get to the point of like getting pissed off
3337.6,3338.6, Is hell playing
3338.6,3339.6, Playing that
3339.6,3341.6, There's even a part of normal like the
3341.6,3342.6, It's a spoiler
3342.6,3344.6, But later on in the game there's some things
3344.6,3346.6, Let's just call them the lasers from walls
3346.6,3348.6, And you want to again
3348.6,3351.6, You know you're stuck with you're running around trying to find a weapon
3351.6,3353.6, Where you can actually return fire on them
3353.6,3355.6, I was wondering like
3355.6,3359.6, How the Wired story is like it just wasn't matching to my experience
3359.6,3361.6, It's like you've got to be fucking kidding me
3361.6,3363.6, This is not the game I read about in this thing
3363.6,3364.6, You know
3364.6,3367.6, What is there are parts that are pretty hard
3367.6,3370.6, It's only the only thing I found
3370.6,3373.6, Not offensive but sort of like
3373.6,3375.6, And I give me a breakway this sort of the same attitude
3375.6,3379.6, You're feeling is when you look at the descriptions of the mode of the different modes
3379.6,3382.6, And you start heroic and it says you know the way it was meant to be played
3382.6,3386.6, That to me it was like fuck you it is so not like normal is
3386.6,3389.6, Heroic is for the ones who are looking for some kind of
3389.6,3391.6, Validation and or massacistic
3391.6,3392.6, It's very messy
3392.6,3395.6, We all just suck here on this podcast
3395.6,3396.6, What do you guys be like the more lazy
3396.6,3400.6, Like when you're guiding which would pretty much start you off on like that horribly hard mode
3400.6,3402.6, And then like a little you
3402.6,3403.6, Like yeah
3403.6,3405.6," Oh okay, so it looks like you really fucking suck"
3405.6,3407.6, So I want to go back to the digital
3407.6,3409.6, We'll get another pink rib
3409.6,3410.6, Oh yeah
3410.6,3412.6, It's the way it's the tone makes a big difference
3412.6,3415.6, Even though I knew switching into an injured dog motor
3415.6,3417.6, Whatever would probably make me enjoy it more
3417.6,3418.6, I couldn't
3418.6,3420.6, Of course we even got that like you said at the beginning
3420.6,3423.6, The discussion we even got that here at one up
3423.6,3424.6, We had people saying to us
3424.6,3425.6, You're playing on normal
3425.6,3426.6, Yeah
3426.6,3429.6, Oh it comes up in every conversation you have about the game
3429.6,3430.6, And they did with Halo 2
3430.6,3432.6, If you had a single complaint
3432.6,3434.6," The first thing they would say, oh did you play it on normal"
3434.6,3438.6, As though and they because they really believed the AI became more you know intelligent
3438.6,3441.6, And it was better on higher difficulty
3441.6,3444.6, Which is ridiculous because you want to show if you had excellent AI
3444.6,3446.6, You'd want to show it off to everyone and play the game
3446.6,3448.6, So the what they do
3448.6,3449.6, Yeah
3449.6,3450.6, They quadrupled the number of enemies
3450.6,3452.6, They give them better weapons in the case
3452.6,3454.6, The car blind snipers that we were mentioning
3454.6,3456.6, They make them more accurate
3456.6,3459.6, They give them more hit points
3459.6,3462.6, I mean is that like if you say you're playing multiplayer right
3462.6,3465.6, And if you want to do that you want to handicap yourself against all of your opponents
3465.6,3468.6, That way I don't know I mean hey if you love it that way
3468.6,3469.6, More power to you
3469.6,3471.6, I mean there's nothing wrong about it
3471.6,3472.6, You can't be wrong about what you enjoy
3472.6,3475.6, But for those of us when you come up and you go oh
3475.6,3477.6," Oh, did you play it on heroic?"
3477.6,3478.6, Like not so fast there Boko
3478.6,3480.6, To test off your own challenge
3480.6,3481.6, I mean it's a similar
3481.6,3483.6, Like we're the workcraft has heroic no dungeons
3483.6,3485.6, Where they do the same exact thing
3485.6,3487.6, It's like yeah the mob the mob's have more hit points
3487.6,3490.6, And a couple of your skills for some random reason
3490.6,3492.6, Just don't work anymore that would have been useful in regular mode
3492.6,3494.6, So that they just kind of artificially do it that way
3494.6,3496.6, It's kind of the same situation
3496.6,3498.6, But they actually getting kind of bonus out of doing that
3498.6,3500.6, Like you better something you get better drive
3500.6,3501.6, Yeah you get better stuff
3501.6,3502.6, Better stuff at the end
3502.6,3505.6, I'm just not very much into playing games
3505.6,3508.6, Nowadays for just the straight-up challenge of it
3508.6,3510.6, Although I said I was playing skate
3510.6,3512.6, And that's like a perfectionist kind of game
3512.6,3513.6, I'm gonna be tri-sending over and over again
3513.6,3515.6, But something like Halo and especially with
3515.6,3519.6, You know what should be a story driven campaign mode
3519.6,3522.6, Where you're supposed to be this incredibly badass character
3522.6,3527.6, I'm just not looking to you know get cock blocked every five seconds
3527.6,3528.6, Yeah
3528.6,3531.6, You got those little tiny guys killing you
3531.6,3533.6, I don't feel like a master chief
3533.6,3534.6, Yeah
3534.6,3537.6, There's to pick up on it actually since we're all talking about the same point
3537.6,3540.6, Point in the beginning of the game when you're approaching the dam
3540.6,3542.6, That's because that's when they introduce the snipers
3542.6,3543.6, Yeah
3543.6,3544.6, As you're going through there
3544.6,3546.6, Did you notice the music that they started playing
3546.6,3549.6, Sound like like from like a Walmart training video or something
3549.6,3551.6, We deployed training video
3551.6,3553.6, That was surreal for me
3553.6,3554.6, You know what I got?
3554.6,3556.6, I heard a little bit like guys
3556.6,3558.6, You know making their noises
3558.6,3560.6, And it's funny because you know in the the other
3560.6,3561.6, People love that music
3561.6,3563.6, You just got like so many people pissed
3563.6,3565.6, Not not the Halo theme
3565.6,3566.6, Yeah
3566.6,3567.6, But there's this
3567.6,3568.6, Not the monks
3568.6,3570.6, Just people love the Halo music in general
3570.6,3572.6, Even though they like when it kicks in like at the end
3572.6,3574.6, With like the Irish folk dancing
3574.6,3575.6, Yeah
3575.6,3576.6, Yeah
3576.6,3577.6, Yeah
3577.6,3578.6, Yeah
3578.6,3579.6, Yeah
3579.6,3580.6, So Halo river
3580.6,3581.6, That part was like surreal
3581.6,3585.6, It had the grunts saying like he's just embarrassing things
3585.6,3586.6, I felt like it was like a
3586.6,3588.6, It was like a kitty cartoon
3588.6,3590.6, You know and then it was playing the Walmart and play training music
3590.6,3593.6, And then at the same time I had like one of my A.A. guys
3593.6,3595.6, Was stuck running into a role
3595.6,3597.6, And all these other things that happened in all games
3597.6,3599.6, You know no matter how good they are
3599.6,3601.6, But it was like they all just came together
3601.6,3603.6, Like so perfectly at the Walmart
3603.6,3604.6, That I was like
3604.6,3606.6, You've got to be fucking kidding me
3606.6,3611.6, But we do the only people
3611.6,3612.6, We do the even need to talk about it
3612.6,3613.6, Have you guys stories?
3613.6,3615.6, Or is that something that PC game or just doesn't do
3615.6,3617.6, Like oh no I'm gonna play
3617.6,3619.6, Like I give it a try
3619.6,3620.6, Dude team fortress 2
3620.6,3621.6, Yeah
3621.6,3622.6, Of course came out this week
3622.6,3623.6, So it's like it's hard to answer
3623.6,3625.6, Yeah when I think about multiplayer
3625.6,3626.6, I'm like I'm gonna play team for
3626.6,3627.6, Most of us play the beta
3627.6,3629.6, I played the beta quite a bit
3629.6,3630.6, Yeah but now it's just timing
3630.6,3632.6, It's like I'm to the point that
3632.6,3634.6, Like I would I really want to play a posing
3634.6,3636.6, Fronts more and more
3636.6,3638.6, But it's like I can't I seriously can't draw
3638.6,3640.6, Get myself away from TF2 right now
3640.6,3642.6, Every time even last night
3642.6,3643.6, You know when you got on
3643.6,3646.6, We were like okay we're gonna play a posing front tonight
3646.6,3649.6, And then you're like hey do you want to teach me a little bit about team fortress
3649.6,3651.6, We're like okay we'll just play a game
3651.6,3653.6, I said it that's all we did all night
3653.6,3654.6, Just to test
3654.6,3657.6, Sean will you teach me about team fortress
3657.6,3660.6, Did you like what you heard when you got in team's week?
3660.6,3662.6, Yeah yeah that was great
3662.6,3664.6, I got on team's week and all I heard was Sean going
3664.6,3666.6, Awww
3666.6,3668.6, I was for like five minutes
3668.6,3669.6, I was sorry though
3669.6,3671.6, No it was totally out of place
3671.6,3673.6, It was me that you felt your filthy underwear
3673.6,3675.6, Do not do not
3675.6,3679.6, I'm not trying to point to the guy next to you
3679.6,3681.6, He did it one point
3681.6,3683.6, When you came in we were just doing the thing
3683.6,3688.6, We're we're calling I was doing the the fat pork chop stuck in the larynx voice
3688.6,3692.6, Oh guys come in a few liter
3692.6,3696.6, But I was talking like I started calling the heavy weapons guy
3696.6,3699.6, With followed by a medic the nambla pair
3699.6,3700.6, It's all I was like
3700.6,3703.6, Guys nambla combo coming in
3703.6,3706.6, And then like as soon as we did that then I started laughing in that voice
3706.6,3708.6, But I was trying to do it like so it sounded natural
3708.6,3710.6, And then it created in from what the
3710.6,3713.6, But into my real laugh
3713.6,3716.6, And then that cracked rory up and he was laughing so hard
3716.6,3717.6, Then that made me laugh
3717.6,3719.6, And that's right when you logged in I think
3719.6,3723.6, Yeah and then he was also then after that he was doing like the german accent
3723.6,3728.6, And asking people if they remember like their first chica and asking about like
3728.6,3730.6, You know and meanwhile I couldn't get my mic to work
3730.6,3732.6, So I'm just listening
3732.6,3735.6, Just going off for five minutes
3735.6,3737.6, And then it's going to motherfucker what's wrong with my mic
3737.6,3738.6, Yeah
3738.6,3742.6, Then I was playing that that's the dpc audio is the most jack thing
3742.6,3746.6, There ever ever was it's mainly getting microphones to work
3746.6,3748.6, But everyone I know we try to get you yeah
3748.6,3751.6, Just slide a set up thing and it like it just doesn't work
3751.6,3753.6, Happened to me rory Robert last night
3753.6,3756.6, I was like had him on the phone my head all cramed with that
3756.6,3759.6, And I had my head set talking to rory on it the same time
3759.6,3762.6, And I was still trying to play and to end you tech support for Robert
3762.6,3764.6, And it was my microphone
3765.6,3767.6, Is the same vista thing those killing me to for a while
3767.6,3770.6, Maybe it's not like I couldn't figure it out
3770.6,3772.6, But he doesn't have we had to figure out if you
3772.6,3774.6," Yeah, we'll let's do a triple triple shoot on the camera"
3774.6,3775.6, Trouble shoot on the camera
3775.6,3777.6," Well, it does a trouble shoot"
3777.6,3778.6, We'll get to the bottom of it though
3778.6,3779.6, And you'll be
3779.6,3780.6," Hello, no take calls"
3780.6,3785.6, We had you know this was crazy like we had jumped into a game last week
3785.6,3790.6, And I started looking at the names and it was you know Robin W. as Dalton
3790.6,3792.6, I mean the crap I'm giving away the game or tag
3792.6,3794.6," Well, that actually these weren't them but it was basically"
3794.6,3797.6, Name as I figured out with Rob Walker Scott Dalton
3797.6,3800.6, Eric Johnson basically all the people that made team fortress 2
3800.6,3803.6, And because I then I looked at their pings
3803.6,3805.6, They're all like one or two
3805.6,3806.6, And I was like oh shit
3806.6,3809.6, This is like valve guys in here
3809.6,3812.6, So on my team it was some other ones I didn't recognize them
3812.6,3814.6, And I was like a crap what am I gonna do
3814.6,3817.6, So I just used like the Ralphie voice and it was like
3817.6,3819.6, Are you guys from valve
3820.6,3824.6, And he was so I was just like oh my god
3824.6,3826.6, Oh my god
3826.6,3829.6, And then like right then he's like okay guys you know we're gonna need
3829.6,3832.6, We're going off and now in Dustball we're gonna need to do this
3832.6,3834.6, And I was like oh throw my life away for you
3834.6,3835.6, I'll do it
3835.6,3837.6, You know you know
3837.6,3840.6, I'll do you tell me what you want it I'm gonna do it
3840.6,3844.6, And like just going with that but then like with some random weirdness
3844.6,3847.6, So like now and then someone they're talking to be like
3847.6,3850.6, You're a question you end all transmissions with over please
3850.6,3852.6, Moreover
3852.6,3854.6, They started doing it
3854.6,3857.6, And they were doing it for the whole game and it back yard
3857.6,3860.6, I got so sick of hearing everyone say over after they got them talking
3860.6,3862.6, And I couldn't go around and say I'm sorry guys
3862.6,3864.6, Please don't say over anymore
3864.6,3866.6, But they were good
3866.6,3868.6, They were really good
3868.6,3869.6, As you'd expect
3869.6,3870.6, Well yeah
3870.6,3872.6, You have to start like reporting your conversations
3872.6,3873.6, You were crazy
3873.6,3874.6, They tell me frown
3874.6,3875.6, That wasn't crazy
3875.6,3876.6, That was entertaining
3876.6,3878.6, Like they were if it it was
3878.6,3881.6, If it even seemed like it was pestering or annoying
3881.6,3883.6, And it wasn't making them laugh I wouldn't stop
3883.6,3884.6, Because that's the difference you know
3884.6,3886.6, Like I mean you hear that kind of nonsense
3886.6,3888.6, Like you just just laugh at it
3888.6,3890.6, If you get mad then you did or tell them to shut up
3890.6,3891.6, And no one ever said to shut up
3891.6,3893.6, So I was like babbling the whole time
3893.6,3894.6, Just now and then I'd be like
3894.6,3895.6, You know you hang back
3895.6,3897.6, Let me take care of this for you
3897.6,3898.6, I don't want you getting hurt
3898.6,3899.6, Just like
3899.6,3901.6, Trying basically trying to be this halo guy
3901.6,3902.6, You know
3902.6,3904.6, Like trying to love you Robin
3904.6,3905.6, Yeah
3905.6,3907.6, I really wanted
3907.6,3909.6, I really wanted to watch
3909.6,3910.6, Watch them though
3910.6,3911.6, Especially for their engineer play
3911.6,3912.6, To see where the best
3912.6,3914.6, SG placement is
3914.6,3916.6, Way you know blocked themselves in
3916.6,3917.6, If they're doing you know
3917.6,3920.6, Because a few tricks I found I was expecting
3920.6,3922.6, I finally found out the console bind
3922.6,3924.6, Command to detonate all your engineer builds
3924.6,3925.6, So that's teleport exit
3925.6,3926.6, Teleport entrance
3926.6,3928.6, Dispenser and sensory gun
3928.6,3930.6, Unlike team fortress class
3930.6,3932.6, Though there's no splash damage when you detonate them
3932.6,3934.6, Because of course what I intended to do is
3934.6,3936.6, Use them as claymores
3936.6,3938.6, So when people go to certain areas
3938.6,3940.6, I just stack them up there and blow them up
3940.6,3942.6, But what I did find out you could do
3942.6,3944.6, And I just might spread the spread the meme around
3944.6,3946.6, Enough people so that they ultimately change it
3946.6,3948.6, But or they just won't care
3948.6,3950.6, But it's kind of spiteful
3950.6,3953.6, And if you're an engineer and you get the alert
3953.6,3956.6, That some of your builds are have a spy
3956.6,3957.6, Sapper on them
3957.6,3959.6, And you know you're not going to be able to get there in time
3959.6,3961.6, You could blow them up on your own
3961.6,3963.6, And he won't get the point for taking them out
3963.6,3965.6, So it's not really a lost view
3965.6,3967.6, Because if you can't get there you can't get there
3967.6,3968.6, You're going to lose them
3968.6,3970.6, But just at a spite you keep someone else from him
3970.6,3973.6, You diminish the reward he gets for going after it
3973.6,3975.6, So ultimately hopefully he won't be so
3975.6,3978.6, You know how bent on taking out the pissant stuff
3978.6,3979.6, Like dispensers
3979.6,3980.6, So yeah
3980.6,3982.6, That's a new technique
3982.6,3985.6, So when you've built a dispenser something
3985.6,3987.6, And somebody's taking it out you get a notification
3987.6,3988.6, Yeah
3988.6,3989.6, Yeah
3989.6,3991.6, The guy like the creature really good point
3991.6,3992.6, He comes up and he's like
3992.6,3993.6, Spas
3993.6,3995.6, He's just having much spint
3995.6,3997.6, I love that guy
3997.6,3998.6, That guy is voice is all
3998.6,3999.6, That's the engineer
3999.6,4000.6," Yeah, yeah, yeah"
4000.6,4001.6, All the voices are awesome
4001.6,4002.6, Yeah
4002.6,4003.6, I like how the scouts from Brooklyn
4003.6,4004.6, Yeah
4004.6,4007.6," Yeah, he looks like a bike messenger"
4007.6,4009.6," Yeah, he's a biker"
4009.6,4010.6," Yeah, he's a biker"
4010.6,4012.6," Yeah, I really hate this"
4012.6,4013.6, That's a lot
4013.6,4014.6, Paper Mr
4014.6,4019.6, I really hope that they put in the lip syncing to the voice over
4019.6,4023.6, IP in the way that they originally said they were going to
4023.6,4024.6, Maybe it was a miscommunication
4024.6,4026.6," But yes, I want to tell you that"
4026.6,4028.6, And that I've got to imagine the machine
4028.6,4029.6, Of a possibilities there
4029.6,4031.6, Or even just like making the kind of movies we do
4031.6,4033.6, When because when you look at an engineer
4033.6,4036.6, And you hear that voice or like if I'm a scout
4036.6,4037.6, And you hear
4037.6,4039.6," Guys, I'm rid of these"
4039.6,4041.6, And the person actually coming out of his mouth
4041.6,4043.6, And the lips are moving to match it
4043.6,4046.6, And it's that's when it's fat
4046.6,4047.6, It's all not a level
4047.6,4049.6, You just take a whole match just going
4049.6,4052.6, Just remember the map of the medic and his mouth
4052.6,4053.6, Why don't open it?
4053.6,4056.6, They kind of blows my mind that they're willing to put characters
4056.6,4059.6, Of that caliber into something that's just multi-player
4059.6,4062.6," Like a single player, a single player,"
4062.6,4065.6, Story driven experience with those characters
4065.6,4067.6, That cat because they already have more personality
4067.6,4069.6, That tons of single player games
4069.6,4072.6, Just looking for just legends is coming out from a Bondi
4072.6,4073.6, And you're you
4073.6,4074.6, Yeah
4074.6,4076.6, I was going to put it in a burger
4076.6,4078.6, Like the armyman franchise
4078.6,4080.16, I was going to have like the
4080.16,4081.6, Sergeant's revenge kind of career
4081.6,4083.6, If they modeled after army that would be good
4083.6,4086.6," Oh, so Armyman"
4086.6,4089.6," Yeah, Great game"
4089.6,4090.6, That's so much fun
4090.6,4092.6, You guys gotta learn. I want to preach the message of the spy to you
4092.6,4093.6, Because
4093.6,4097.6, I don't know you feel so good when you get on a good run
4097.6,4099.6, With them because it's all about just timing
4099.6,4100.6, And also
4100.6,4104.6, Just convince a people that you're one of them
4104.6,4108.14," You know, but also timing your invisibility. So if you know there's an engineer"
4108.400000000001,4111.92, You might do play some game where you're like okay as dispensers about 10 feet away
4111.92,4114.160000000001, I'm gonna put something on it and I know he can get to it
4114.8,4119.88, But then I'm gonna do that go invisible again immediately and relocate and then you come back and stab him
4119.88,4125.6," But then you go invisible again, so a century doesn't get you and then once he's gone then you could take the century out and you and your best"
4125.6,4128.88, Run you're just skipping around constantly cloaking changing costumes
4129.08,4134.0, You pass by the battle mitts then you go sniper and kind of like do like you would if you were playing sniper
4134.0,4140.42, Just like slowly peek outside the walls though you were zoomed in to the enemy century guns recognize you as a spy if you're in costume
4140.42,4143.92," No, they know that's the whole nature of the spies to take out those"
4144.48,4146.48, Diploidals yeah
4146.48,4153.12, Engineers however can shoot at you all they want because the game is designed so it friendly fire to so that friendly fire isn't on
4154.44,4156.44, That's that's the danger
4157.44,4162.8," Yeah, but it's fun. I seems pretty complicated. I mean I was watching you play it and I was like, what what?"
4162.8,4167.360000000001," I know you're so fast with that too. Yeah, it's watching you almost discouraged me from playing"
4168.08,4172.12, This is I maybe here in that like last night when we were playing in the game
4172.12,4176.88, I told I was just joking around with Roy though and Robert. This was so weird cuz Robert's Mike didn't work
4176.88,4181.06, But he could hear us so it's like imagine just listening to us idiots babbling and to you speaking
4181.06,4184.72," I was like man, it's just an art form when I'm doing this file like this"
4185.72,4187.72, Shut the fuck up about your finger painting dude
4187.72,4191.8," I was like all right, and then I went to some other class"
4192.400000000001,4194.52, Show what you're what's your maximum or a backstab?
4194.52,4200.320000000001," I don't know I have to look that is even worth using the hand done with the spy. Yeah, it's Brad. It's very powerful"
4200.4800000000005,4204.08," It's a great weapon. Oh, that's a good looking weapon"
4204.08,4209.400000000001, Don't yeah the second the thing is was spy if you know don't if you get caught if you if you screw up
4209.400000000001,4213.56, Say someone turn just as you're going for the back stab and instead you got like a side-shank
4213.56,4214.84, Which doesn't do anything?
4214.84,4219.04, Don't be dumb and just keep running at him with your knife. You're gonna get shot in the face like immediately
4219.320000000001,4223.52, Plan on getting away like if you don't have enough if you have cloak cloak and just try to get away
4223.52,4228.120000000001, Unless it's a heavy then you're pretty much dead because what happens is when you're cloak so-and-hits you
4228.120000000001,4232.52, It'll silhouette you a little bit and because the heavy spits out so much fire
4232.52,4238.280000000001, You really have no choice you're just gonna be like opaque to him anyway and it'll blast you but anyone else
4238.639999999999,4243.28, If you tell your out of cloak and it's someone like an engineer or something you've got every chance of winning just go to your
4243.28,4247.32, Magnum and as you're retreating by yourself time for your next cloak and to get more health
4247.679999999999,4251.759999999999, Shoot them in heads many times as you can if you're a magnet more often than not you'll win
4253.28,4255.28," Thanks to the tips. Yeah, that's pro tips. Yeah"
4256.28,4258.679999999999, I'll put that holding a team for it. Just clean it guys
4259.759999999999,4265.48, I'll put that on the right up hips and tricks for surviving and team fighters by John Elliott
4266.2,4268.919999999999, I wish you guys got to go to that crisis thing. Oh
4269.32,4271.48," Yeah, yeah, I mean, I wanted to hear about that"
4271.599999999999,4275.5199999999995," Well, how many you've played the beta here a little bit? I play a little bit of the beta here"
4275.5199999999995,4279.759999999999, Not in any of the as much as you I got a couple I picked up a couple tricks from playing and then got my ass kicked
4279.759999999999,4285.24," So far yeah, and so far as you can say you play the play the beta that runs at like 14 frames per second"
4285.24,4290.639999999999," On a 800 ultra yeah, let's just say I really is it that well"
4290.639999999999,4295.12," It's hard the optimist just put it that's out. Yeah, they actually I played the multiplayer"
4295.92,4300.76, That this event and it was like a more recent build and they said
4300.76,4304.48, You know I talked to someone there that provide the computers and they said it was the same card that we have here
4304.48,4308.76, Never all the specs were I mean none of them were better and so I take it
4308.76,4315.48, I understood that to mean that the build was just optimized and it ran really well was really smooth so I have faith in that
4316.32,4318.32, But again we're talking about like
4319.12,4323.639999999999," An 8800 yeah, thanks you get the game doesn't rhyme. I mean there's all this talk about you know"
4323.639999999999,4326.04, It's kind of what we were talking to Chava and last week show. It's like well. Yeah
4326.04,4329.88, It's great that you're building for the future but shit if with an 8800
4329.88,4332.38, I can't even play it at reasonable frame rate today
4333.84,4335.36, Not so excited about scary
4335.36,4337.92, Each year just go back to playing team for sure as you know
4337.92,4343.96," Actually, I want to just interrupt to pimped that podcast on our time because it got a little bit lost from the shuffle of"
4344.32,4349.2, Are doing two podcasts last week. So if you haven't heard it if you're listening it didn't know we did this we
4349.84,4351.96, Spent 90 minutes right about the
4353.24,4359.04, interviewing Chava at the the CEO of CryTech and the makers of crisis coming up and it was a
4359.6,4364.44, Pretty great interview. I have to say I mean partly because
4365.2,4366.88," Of our questions, but"
4366.88,4370.44, Mostly because he was just great with his answer absolutely was super forthcoming
4370.44,4375.96, So if you are a knowledge student crisis go to podcast.1up.com and look for the crisis special there
4376.44,4380.639999999999," Okay, so the single so coming out of that you know, we're trying to play"
4380.639999999999,4383.679999999999, I tried to play the multiplayer bait at home and had the same problem
4383.679999999999,4387.599999999999," We tried it here and then I was like yeah, I'm just not gonna do it because from multiplayer like that"
4387.799999999999,4390.48, You want performance more than you want appearance
4390.879999999999,4396.24," You know, I mean especially when it's that bad it was just the motion blur was overdone and they've"
4396.24,4401.88, Sense fixed that so anyway when I go to the event and you know disclosure it was on the US Hornet
4402.599999999999,4404.76, Decommissioned their craft carrier world war two era
4404.76,4407.76, And that was to you know to promote the game and
4408.16,4412.74," It was really cool place, you know, I'm into playing so they had tons of stuff on the inside the hangar"
4413.0,4416.92, Lot of cool stuff to look at but the game well. It was a point at doing it there
4416.92,4421.2, You know because there's some level at they always come up with some random thing but in the game
4421.2,4425.139999999999, There's an aircraft carrier level. It's also a map for death match
4425.780000000001,4431.18, So it was like there is another event. I went there a long time ago over the transformers game there
4431.18,4437.02, And it was because of boss. It was an aircraft carrier that turned to a robot so they're like let's do it. Let's do it there
4438.34,4442.900000000001," Can't complain those a nice nice place to go play with that chair, man. No, okay"
4444.18,4447.84," When I sat down and played the single player thing, you know for my e3 impressions"
4447.84,4454.62, I was already like really convinced that there's some awesome stuff to you know to on tap there at this level just blew my mind
4455.22,4461.46, Because it was you know about three times the size of the the e3 demo and it starts off in the middle of the night
4462.26,4468.820000000001," Very cool scenario where you come in and you're with a bunch of other, you know fellow allied troopers in the way that you would be in call due to you or something like that"
4469.22,4473.660000000001, And they take off and you're like welcome to follow them and play that way and if you stick with them
4473.660000000001,4480.54, It will play out like some of the earlier levels and the call due to game or something where you get the sense of these guys are leading me
4480.82,4484.26," And if as long as I stay with them, I'm not gonna have to worry about getting lost or whatever"
4484.26,4487.34, But you can also immediately ditch them and take a boat
4487.34,4490.38, You can go on the mountains you can go on the roads and the on the car
4490.38,4494.6, I mean and your objectives are marked out on your map and you can you know like in a battlefield or something
4494.6,4496.6, You can hit the map key take a look at those
4496.98,4499.62, Click them so that they do come up in your your HUD and
4501.22,4504.74," As you're out doing this, you know the the sun dynamically rises"
4505.3,4508.3, Time of day changes and all the stuff's going on and
4508.7,4512.5, The size of it at first is impressive because when you look and you're like okay
4512.74,4517.179999999999, You're just like in the same way that a believing in that base level when you're playing a believe in and you see about and you're like
4517.179999999999,4522.74, I'm gonna try to go there and you do go there and you can but in this on a little bit smaller scale
4522.74,4524.58, Of course because this is just one level in the game
4525.219999999999,4529.54, You're like this is like bigger than the 64 player size battlefield to map or something and
4530.1,4536.72, To have that range and there's still stuff going on because it's designed in such a way so that they're their pockets of stuff or like if you know
4536.72,4541.34, I was up in mountains and I just started who's yawning throwing great grenades and
4541.34,4547.2, In the bunch trees palm trees all fall over and then a boat comes up because they saw the palm trees fall over
4547.54,4552.94," They start shooting at you, but of course if you're hiding in the bushes instead of shooting at you through the bushes"
4552.94,4555.74, They shoot where the bushes are moving which is very great
4555.86,4562.94," Fallibility, you know, it's like simulating fallibility in the AI is red because again it ratchet sub attention makes you feel as though there is a threat"
4562.94,4564.94, But without just like you're just dead
4565.62,4567.94, Because they've they got a bottom something and
4569.219999999999,4571.58," Yeah, so just playing this thing was fantastic"
4572.42,4575.42, Objectives in this case were very simple ultimately amounted to destroying
4575.98,4577.98, Certain things such as an antaircraft
4578.3,4582.46," Mobile antaircraft platform, but then of course when you get to it how you destroy it"
4583.42,4587.82, If you have a rocket you can use it if you have grenades or central charges or something and all those
4587.82,4593.38, You use them in the same way you would in any circumstance like battlefield it would be the same as if someone on the other team
4593.86,4601.06, Took a NAA platform and you wanted to take that out and then that failing which did because I ran out of explosives
4601.06,4605.74," I was like okay, well, let's find a pickup truck and drive that very much like grant if dot would drive that up to the thing"
4605.9800000000005,4610.94, Part these bad boys around it and then blow them up and then cause an explosion that way
4611.74,4616.86, But the thing is fun the AI seemed great and it was just again the graphics do matter
4616.86,4621.46, It was so immersive feeling like I'm gonna jump I'm gonna climb this mountain and then
4621.86,4627.419999999999, Jump off into the water and do like this Greg will gain his dive and then you see the coral and the fish and stuff and then
4627.419999999999,4632.74, You know boats combine their shoot at you and you see the bullets coming through the water at you. It's just really I
4632.74,4637.54, Got to say I don't know much about this game and you talking about it reminds me of like conversations
4637.54,4640.06, That we would have in here kids about super Mario brothers
4641.5,4646.66," But it's like what the fuck is this game? Yeah, like we're just gonna like what you climb a mountain"
4646.66,4650.34, You jump off into the water and there's fish in the water
4651.22,4653.22, blowing up a gun with a bunch of trucks
4655.5,4657.5, What the fuck are you talking
4659.5,4661.5," Okay, there's mushrooms"
4662.74,4664.46," No, you just a little conversation"
4664.46,4670.74, Like here's the fish that have wings and they fly up out of the water and if you have a mushroom
4670.74,4672.94, Then you can get hit once and you will die
4673.46,4679.5," But you know, it's like that kind of stuff for him like it doesn't really make sense to me like because throwing a grenade at a tree"
4680.22,4683.5, And having the tree followers very much like having a
4684.18,4685.86, Mushroom make you bigger something
4685.86,4691.78, I have no point of reference for that in my life. It's so very much like Mario that so let me back it up
4691.78,4699.54," Yeah, I haven't had the right mushrooms. No, but okay, so I'm assuming the point of entry is that all of you at least played a single player"
4699.54,4708.0, First person shooter where you're going along what amounts to a path and you shoot guys that appear before you and you continue to move forward
4708.219999999999,4712.58, Sometimes there might be an objective that will be like open the store by blowing it up by putting a
4712.58,4717.78, Satchel charge on it or something or a tank will appear blow up this tank or guys in the truck come out shoot the truck
4717.94,4719.46, So
4719.58,4723.62," Take that as your point of reference, but instead of going down that path it's it's a very big"
4723.82,4728.38," You know, it's a stand-backs very much like you know again like it's like GTA shooter play"
4728.38,4733.34, So it's this very big field and instead of the script saying okay a tank's gonna come out here now or something
4733.62,4736.34, Or boat will appear the boats are already out patrolling
4736.34,4740.82," You know, they're already doing their thing in the same way that you know, please are driving around in Liberty City and"
4741.94,4746.26, They're alerted by your presence when you arrive or when you do things that would you know
4746.26,4751.3, Reasonable alert their presence like create explosions or or if they're like a garden a watch tower
4751.3,4755.56, So they're even more alert where they're looking for any little thing if you're invisible moving through the bushes
4755.72,4760.62, They can't see you that's one of your suit powers now. It's getting now. It's getting the mario land
4762.34,4763.62, I know shoot
4763.62,4769.38," So yeah, let's just switch it to narrow quick because I think you get that point, right? Yeah, I get it you get I just when you say climb a mountain"
4769.38,4770.58, Do you mean like
4770.58,4771.86, I'm a mountain
4771.86,4774.58, Very big mountain and then I don't mean there's like like we're pellop
4774.58,4779.46, There's no mechanic where you know you're in in control of each of your hands and your feet
4779.46,4783.7, You know and you're working your way at that way screw that very much walking and jumping
4784.1,4789.7, But so if you see a big mountain in the distance of a game oftentimes those are are they don't really exist
4789.7,4792.26, So to speak there they exist and what's called the skybox
4792.82,4800.26, So there's like a three a miniature three-dimensional model that exists and and they kind of the game map maker will put that off to the side
4800.26,4803.3," And then that projects around you, but you can never get out there and"
4804.58,4807.54," And sometimes yeah, they'll they'll use you know pictures or something"
4807.54,4810.900000000001, It'll be like a jpeg or something or a high res of a mountain or something
4811.06,4817.54, So of course it's it's actually rendering the geometry and all the bushes and stuff you see on it are very much there and so if you do go up it
4817.54,4819.54, You know their trees their animals
4820.5,4824.62, And stuff like that and you just yeah you find your own path you can't just go anywhere
4824.62,4828.900000000001, But you look and maybe there's enough the rocks are shaped in such a way that there's foothold and stuff like that
4829.379999999999,4834.66, And sure best to right chief trip. So what are these because you said at the beginning that there is this squad
4834.66,4839.86," You could have followed the whole way through yeah, do you know were you gonna make a position to be able to tell like what they were doing?"
4839.86,4842.66, And depending on maybe you want to split off from them like with they progress
4842.66,4846.259999999999," Yeah, they were doing the wrong stuff yeah, but all the time when I was up on the mountain"
4847.0599999999995,4853.78, A helicopter came in some they were starting some shade over on a bridge and then it there was a fight over there and then it blew up some cars
4854.74,4859.139999999999, Plains would fly through now and then and so they're definitely out doing stuff and you can meet up with them again
4859.139999999999,4863.8, I think eventually I just entirely neglected him and I think they all died can they yet?
4864.5199999999995,4866.5199999999995," Yeah, could they finish the mission with that?"
4866.5199999999995,4871.36," No, you could just sit on the mountain and the vernacular we've complete everyone always asked that question"
4871.36,4873.36, But it's like do you really want someone to answer no?
4873.36,4877.16," No, I have to say that in a hail three every once in a while like you know"
4877.16,4882.7, I'd be like fucking like jumping against a wall or doing something horrible and then all of us and the other guys all of a sudden
4882.7,4889.179999999999, It would be checkpoint complete and I'd be like oh cool nice. Thanks guys. Okay. That's like the opposite of my experience
4890.62,4892.62," Yeah, yeah, anyway"
4892.62,4899.179999999999," So we have 10 minutes left. All right eight minutes left. Well, we got a stop a little early"
4899.179999999999,4902.0599999999995, Did you uh you want to talk about the dosent on the ship?
4902.0599999999995,4904.0599999999995, Remember you mentioned in quickly like death?
4905.099999999999,4909.9, Inspired by yeah as we left there was yeah like a an older guy who you know
4909.9,4913.7, was a volunteer dosent for the because the aircraft carriers of museum and
4914.879999999999,4917.94, He had been wandering around and they're looking at the game and it was just kind of weird
4917.94,4922.299999999999, I was with one of the one up show guys and and we're we're talking to him and and
4923.099999999999,4927.0199999999995, He's like you know this is just unbelievable that thing that that's pretty you know
4927.0199999999995,4931.82, Indistinguishable from real life right now and he's like and he immediately switched into the column mind stuff like
4931.82,4934.86, I'm just worried you know what point that's just not enough for you
4934.86,4939.42, And you gotta go and do it in the school or something and it was really strange because of course
4939.42,4945.179999999999," There we were on an aircraft carrier to museum to combat and stuff, you know and"
4946.38,4951.0199999999995, And so you know I asked him like well did you ever play Cowboys and Indian you know when you're kid or did you?
4951.0199999999995,4955.42, I mean because in my era we had plastic guns or something or if you kind of order when you take a sticker something
4955.42,4962.0599999999995, I was like I know even before that all you need was a branch and you you probably spent I'm assuming a large portion of your youth
4962.06,4967.26," Pretending you're shooting people and fighting stuff right and he's like yeah, well that didn't look that real though"
4967.660000000001,4971.740000000001, You know I was like but in your head you're actually imagining you were doing it though
4971.740000000001,4977.02, And I was like but my point is I think male and society you spend your youth growing up
4977.580000000001,4979.820000000001, Pretending you're in war or fighting or wrestling
4979.820000000001,4985.900000000001, And actually I had to see a game that looks as real is how that looked to me even out as a kid as far as in my
4987.900000000001,4991.42," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's the I mean the whole point ultimately is it's not that"
4992.14,4994.54, It's not even comparing those two it's just that will
4995.900000000001,5001.660000000001," Yeah, okay, it's not gonna make you let's say how many million copies of violent games get sold and how many times you have those instances"
5001.660000000001,5006.860000000001, Let's just say you know or something else and we'll say that debate for some time for for another podcast
5006.860000000001,5011.26," Well, let's just say it's not it's not a matter of these guys are gonna play a crisis and"
5011.820000000001,5016.54," And worry about you, but it's not because it was really interesting talking to this guy and it's kind of made you feel awkward too"
5016.54,5021.5, Because you were there all you know in this privileged environment and I was like get the camera rolling
5021.5,5026.14, Let's interview this guy for the one I'm showing this would be like a red segment instead of just you know the usual
5026.14,5028.22, I know if it's to them because it was kind of like
5028.94,5033.5, I'm sure they don't love to you. I just like happened so quick and we didn't want to go at that point after we left
5033.5,5036.06, Let's go hit that guy if you can ask him if you want to be on tape
5036.22,5041.34, But it was just interesting you know you just got sure about beat them up and then proven his point
5041.58,5043.58," Yeah, fuck you they make us violent"
5043.9,5045.9, I
5046.46,5051.42, Think it's also weird that people never talk about the fact that if games ever got to the point of like say
5051.42,5057.74," Okay, you have a game that's is realistically looking as crisis and you've said it in a school or you can go shoot a bunch of people like"
5058.22,5063.0199999999995, Any normally like moral person is gonna be repulsed you would go in shoot somebody and be like
5063.98,5071.66, This is gross. It's as terrible like and that's you know when it's realism as in your a super soldier
5071.82,5076.7, Sneakin around on a mountain shooting people like it's a little different and even you know is funny before
5077.0199999999995,5079.82, We even talked to the guy. I think we're already talking about
5081.099999999999,5085.0199999999995, Some of the random videos out there on YouTube and I don't mean like you know the the beheadings and stuff
5085.0199999999995,5090.139999999999, But even stuck military.net where there will be you know an AC 130 gun ship at night or something
5090.7,5096.62," Or an Apache and they're very much in gun cam black and white, you know taken from like massive distances"
5096.62,5099.42, Sometimes you know to a mile or more and when you see those
5100.38,5106.3, The moment it starts your gut drops and you feel like your adrenaline goes and it puts you in fighter flight mode
5106.46,5107.74, Just watching those
5107.74,5112.7, You never I've never gotten anything even remotely like that playing any game ever and yet here
5112.7,5118.38, I'm watching something that you know very much for all tents and purposes looks like it would be video game content because
5118.38,5122.38," It's a because there's a crosshair, you know the way when you're working the house or in an AC 130 or something"
5123.02,5126.46, And you see it you just know you're like someone died there and it's fucked up
5126.54,5129.18," And you don't want to watch and you put it down and you're like almost shaking, you know"
5129.58,5131.58, There's a very very you know awkward experience
5131.58,5135.58, I think most people have at least seen something like that on the internet some or even a scene of a fight
5135.58,5139.42, Just to be people in the street fighting or something you know like a happy slapper someone
5139.9800000000005,5143.18, You know that's where you run around Europe and you just randomly slap someone up
5143.18,5149.66," Yeah, and you see that and you're like react in a different way and it's like dude people's minds are sophisticated things and they're"
5150.22,5152.62, I think most of us and that's the question. I mean for the
5153.099999999999,5157.66," Okay, this is they're not and then something goes wrong, but I'd say for just about everyone else"
5158.22,5166.94," Well, I think here is that like if these are if they become that real looking that like more impressionable young kids"
5166.94,5172.0599999999995, The rudder and I don't know whatever the theory will see will play these and they won't learn
5172.78,5178.22, That there is a difference between that and real like we play the like combat when we were growing up or whatever
5179.02,5183.58, I could see where maybe someone who doesn't play these could get a little more afraid that like their five-year-old
5183.58,5187.42, I don't think so because in a movie it's even different say the difference between when you're watching
5187.42,5192.22," Save it, Prime and Ryan and again watching one of those videos. It's still there even though that's like perfect"
5192.22,5196.54," That's right, you know it's not interactive. I mean that's like it looks real they look like real gods"
5196.54,5201.18, It looks like real cool. I just think that might be where some of the fear that people yeah
5201.18,5205.26, Extends from right. I am questionable. You like sub deep seated party your brain is like
5205.5,5208.14, Purbly capable of if it wasn't in it
5209.26,5212.22, You know the society wouldn't be functioning right now
5212.22,5216.46," Right, I mean everybody is going millions of copies of these get we would all be dead"
5216.46,5219.900000000001, Just a video game. Everybody is going home every night and watching violent TV
5220.3,5222.54, For whatever I mean obviously there's our brain
5223.02,5227.18, All the different some of the areas of the the the most heinous violence in the world right now
5227.18,5230.780000000001, Barring parts were to avoid the politics where the US is involved sure
5230.94,5235.42, But there are parts in the world right now where there's extreme violence and they're definitely not cultures
5235.42,5239.0199999999995, I have the privilege of having all this access to violent media that we do you know
5239.98,5246.38, It's just even even you know aside from the old argument the people just always back and forth whether
5246.38,5249.98, Not violence causes violence or whatever violent entertainment
5250.139999999999,5253.58, But this weird argument that has popped up in the past few years of like
5253.98,5258.54," Games train people to be killers. Yeah, that's an amazing"
5258.54,5262.5, That one the imagination like Robert found that out when yeah
5263.74,5265.74, I've discovered that the
5266.3,5269.9, coalition is not very very correlated to a real gun
5270.46,5273.1, You were looking for the wasky keys on the guns. Yeah
5273.66,5277.34," Where's the left mouse button on this thing yeah, it's weird"
5277.34,5281.0199999999995, I think it's and it's just people that didn't grow playing games they see it and
5282.14,5287.42, And they think that somehow there's some level of realism there that there isn't just because of the way they look
5287.74,5291.9," Like yeah, it looks pretty real but like play the game. Yeah, you're looking right you're fucking"
5291.9,5293.58, We're obviously
5293.58,5295.1, The choir here on the right
5295.1,5296.78," Yeah, but yeah"
5296.9400000000005,5298.9400000000005," Anyway, yeah anyway"
5299.5,5302.7, We came full circle we did for the intro song
5303.82,5306.72, Now we got to get to the bottom of why kids masturbate to pork you
5309.34,5312.62, I've had the line in my head for like 24 hours. Thank you very much
5313.9,5315.9," Yeah, I don't know if to say that"
5316.86,5317.9, I'll say goodbye
5319.9,5325.0199999999995," Before the break I talk about never went or nights to it didn't happen. Oh, yeah, so I'll do an exam or no"
5325.5,5329.54, Right at time it's good. It's coming in who's kicking us out? Let our audience know who they should hate oh
5330.0599999999995,5334.62, our boss our new boss Simon Cox the this company game group
5335.66,5337.66, Pf content here
5338.46,5340.46, Send angry email
5340.46,5342.46," No, don't please don't he's my boss"
5344.46,5346.46, Please don't
5346.46,5351.02," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, short version of never went or nights to mask of the betrayer"
5351.5,5358.14, I finished it. It comes out in a week. I reviewed it for for the magazine and it is quite good
5358.94,5364.22, And I I say that with great not not surprised but I was a bit
5365.18,5368.54, Actually like I like never went or nights to but it had massive
5369.1,5371.66, Technical problems when a first came out there have been
5372.7,5375.5, 250 megabytes worth of patches and counting
5376.3,5384.62, Since never went or nights too shipped to try to fix all the original camera problems and bugs and everything and they finally got it to where the base game is running pretty good
5385.34,5389.5, And now the expansion is out and I played it. I'm rushing because we have to quit but
5390.22,5394.3, Short version is it's a it's a great campaign. I think it's the best campaign that
5395.02,5398.46, Obsidian has made yet and their output includes what?
5399.26,5401.26, co-tor 2
5402.22,5405.26, I think just that co-tor 2 never went or two and now this
5405.82,5410.38, these guys are the refugees of black aisle studios so these are the guys who made
5411.66,5417.02, Worked with buyer wear on botherscape one and two and then on our own they made the never went or nights games
5417.9800000000005,5420.38, Plainscape torment so their there RPG
5422.22,5427.5, Pedigree is outstanding and I don't feel I can tell now they've sort of hit it out of the park
5428.06,5435.02, To the level that they did back in black aisle but I feel like this expansion is the closest they've come yet to kind of getting that back
5435.820000000001,5437.820000000001, So that's my review
5438.38,5442.780000000001, You know what let's find a way where we can come back and continue this after they use it cuz Robert had
5443.099999999999,5447.98," Oh, he's right there. We are out just Simon we've done Robert had that you just worry about"
5448.3,5450.3, Texas gun shop and oh
5450.94,5455.0199999999995," The Texas gun shop story yeah, we're getting the yeah, we're getting the hell out"
