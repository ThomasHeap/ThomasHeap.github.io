0.0,10.0," Hello and welcome to the CDW Radio podcast. This is the podcast for October 11th, 2006."
10.0,18.0," And I'm joined today by the entire edits staff of computer gaming world magazine, which we still offer a couple more weeks."
18.0,21.0, And that's staff of editors. Includes.
21.0,23.0," Ryan Scott, Darren Gladstone."
23.0,25.0, Oh my goodness.
25.0,29.0, Oh my goodness.
30.0,32.0, A new paradigm has been set.
32.0,34.0, That introduction.
34.0,35.0, Sean Malloy.
39.0,44.0, Good to be back here. We skipped a week last week and we apologize for that.
44.0,47.0," And now so I have to say, Darren, are you dying over there?"
47.0,48.0, Still recover.
48.0,49.0, Still recovering.
49.0,55.0, I appreciate all of the hate mail that we got to people telling us we weren't there last week.
56.0,59.0, It means a lot to us that you actually notice that we're not there.
59.0,62.0," So we are committed now to doing this weekly, right guys?"
62.0,64.0, We always are.
64.0,69.0, Someone has to leave either the country or the city or whatever for for business purposes.
69.0,72.0," Or yeah, and then it just kind of throws a wrench in the city."
72.0,77.0," And part of the problem, we can't get the five of us in the same room on a weekly basis."
77.0,78.0," Well, they have CDW Radio."
78.0,79.0, One of us has gone.
79.0,81.0," Darren, Darren, or Sean will be gone."
81.0,84.0," And it's like, you know, you don't really want to listen to me talk."
84.0,85.0, Good point.
85.0,86.0, You don't have anything.
86.0,87.0, I don't have anything.
87.0,88.0," No, I think he's right."
88.0,89.0, It's just less than me.
89.0,90.0, All right.
90.0,93.0," Do you know, I want to I just want to funky baseline next time."
93.0,96.0, I know that that kind of messed me up.
96.0,98.0, I was trying to set it up so we bring it in for a little hype.
98.0,99.0, Yeah.
99.0,102.0, Some day we'll have a theme song too.
102.0,104.0, I think eventually.
104.0,105.0, All right.
105.0,106.0, But let's get this moving.
106.0,107.0, Shall we.
107.0,109.0, We have a lot to talk about.
109.0,111.0, We've all been playing many new things.
111.0,116.0," Sean, neither Sean or I have played while for a little while now, which is kind of amazing."
116.0,118.0, So we have other games to talk about.
118.0,119.0, All of us.
119.0,121.0, A couple of big things happened.
121.0,125.0, PC gaming had an outstanding week on national TV this week.
125.0,127.0, So we'll talk about that a little.
127.0,130.0, We have usual news bits.
130.0,133.0, We're going to try to get at least one.
133.0,135.0, Reader letter in.
135.0,140.0, But why don't we start with the usual and find out what we've all been playing.
140.0,144.0, Hopefully it's some new stuff and new stuff on the PC would be good.
144.0,146.0, It's a start.
146.0,148.0," Ryan, I'm looking at you."
148.0,150.0, Are you staring at me?
150.0,152.0, But hell you're playing.
152.0,155.0, I've been playing the new salmon next game.
155.0,158.0, I think we've all been waiting for for a while.
158.0,160.0," It's got a funny, as soon as they gave us the codes for that."
160.0,164.0," Like I think like everyone at the end is like, okay, is there a code to what you play it to?"
164.0,165.0, Yeah.
165.0,167.0, It's it's a cool game.
167.0,172.0, I don't really have much I should say about it since it's not out until next week.
172.0,173.0, Okay.
173.0,179.0," But for everybody who's been waiting, you know, 13 years or whatever for a new salmon max game,"
179.0,181.0, you're going to love it.
181.0,183.0, It feels like salmon max too.
183.0,189.0, It totally feels like a good kind of a classic style adventure game.
189.0,193.0, Some people on the forums have been complaining about the character's voices.
193.0,194.0, You know what?
194.0,197.0, I was about to ask if you had if you had checked this out as well because there's a little
197.0,199.0," War, I mean, I'm an audio snob."
199.0,200.0, There's a bit of a warble.
200.0,202.0," Well, like any time you listen, like, they have any word with an estimate."
202.0,206.0," It sounds like it's kind of getting, I don't know, just messed up a little."
206.0,209.0, But you're talking about actually like the voices themselves.
209.0,210.0, The voices of salmon.
210.0,212.0, The character's a sensation.
212.0,213.0," Same guy, right?"
213.0,214.0," Well, no, it's not."
214.0,218.0," I mean, they're the two guys who voiced them for the original game."
218.0,221.0, I know that the dude who did a salmon's voice was Bill Farmer.
221.0,225.0, The guy who does like goofy and a bunch of other Disney characters.
225.0,232.0," And these guys, I guess the rationale that a telltale gave us for why they weren't using those guys"
232.0,236.0," and because they couldn't commit to like a monthly, like a monthly schedule."
236.0,239.0, Just because they're like career voice actors.
239.0,242.0, So they have some very good sound elikes.
242.0,247.0," And some people on the forum are kind of angry at it, but I didn't have a problem with them."
247.0,251.0," If you don't know the old one, so obviously it's not going to matter at all."
251.0,252.0," Right, right."
252.0,255.0, How are the puzzles in the game?
255.0,259.0, It's all good kind of salmon max logic.
259.0,265.0," Yeah, it's a pretty consistent, I mean, it's not like you're going to, I mean, you have to think like that weird logic."
265.0,267.0, But it's on par with how it used to be.
267.0,270.0, And it's nothing that's going to get you stuck for too long.
270.0,272.0, They're all fun puzzles.
272.0,276.0," And the new one, the next episode is, oh, well, the first one doesn't even out yet."
276.0,277.0, The first episode.
277.0,278.0," Yeah, next one, next month."
278.0,281.0, So who are these people talking on the forums of the game is an out yet?
281.0,282.0, How are people bitching on forums?
282.0,286.0," Well, they're going off of the voices from the trailers."
286.0,287.0, Okay.
287.0,289.0," I mean, it's the same voices that are in the game."
289.0,290.0, Okay.
290.0,292.0, That's got to be great.
292.0,293.0, Your game isn't even out yet.
293.0,294.0, You already have people on the forums.
294.0,297.0, That's not the way it's supposed to be.
297.0,298.0, Sheesh.
298.0,299.0, That's a good set.
299.0,300.0, I can't break it.
300.0,301.0, She's already buddy.
301.0,302.0," Thanks, ingrates."
302.0,305.0, But it like all the humor and all the other stuff.
305.0,308.0, The people are hoping they get right.
308.0,310.0, They think they got it right.
310.0,315.0, And but tell people about how long episode one took you to play.
315.0,323.0," Um, well, if you're like me and you take the time to explore every nook and cranny and every dialogue choice takes about."
323.0,327.0," Between three and four hours, which, you know, I mean, we expected that."
327.0,328.0, It's a episodic.
328.0,333.0," You know, and the price structure on that is what how much how much is that going to cost?"
333.0,336.0," You know, I know it's available on game tab."
336.0,338.0, I think game taps like 10 bucks a month.
338.0,339.0, Right.
339.0,340.0, Yeah.
340.0,342.0, I know it's going to be available on telltale site as well.
342.0,345.0, And I actually don't know what the price is.
345.0,349.0," Oh, on a somewhat tangential note, not that I'm pimping for game tab."
349.0,350.0, But I did notice that.
350.0,352.0, But I did notice actually.
352.0,354.0," Excuse me, Lee."
354.0,355.0, This 20 way.
355.0,356.0, All right.
356.0,358.0," They're actually just, I just got a press release."
358.0,362.0, They're re running all the original 7x cartoons from the Fox network on the
362.0,363.0, game tap.
363.0,364.0, Right.
364.0,365.0, They just announced that yesterday.
365.0,366.0, Right.
366.0,367.0, I'm sure that was pretty cool.
367.0,368.0, That's awesome.
368.0,369.0, Yeah.
369.0,370.0, That is cool.
370.0,371.0, I barely remember seeing those shows.
371.0,372.0, I think they just kind of blip.
372.0,377.0," They were, they were on for a season that I believe they won some sort of best new cartoon"
377.0,378.0, awards.
378.0,384.0, And we're taken off the air for what I think our political reasons of some sort.
384.0,387.0," Wait, Fox takes shows off the show off the air prematurely."
387.0,388.0, Ha.
388.0,389.0, That's a little bit show.
389.0,390.0, Yeah.
390.0,392.0," Well, it'll be back up on gamechaps."
392.0,393.0, That's got a cool.
393.0,394.0, That's cool.
394.0,395.0," He playing anything else, Ryan?"
395.0,397.0, Or is that about it these days?
397.0,399.0," That's, that's the big one."
399.0,400.0, Okay.
400.0,404.0, So that was a three hour game and you've played nothing else in two weeks.
404.0,405.0, Why?
405.0,410.0, I also played a fan remake of Kings Quest 3.
410.0,411.0," Oh, yeah."
411.0,415.0, Which we're actually reviewing for the first issue of games for Windows.
415.0,417.0, I'm excited about that precedent.
417.0,422.0," If I may be, if I may tut our own horn for the moment, we reviewed officially."
422.0,425.0, A fan made remake of a game.
425.0,427.0, So I think that's totally good.
427.0,428.0, That's totally good.
428.0,429.0, We like it.
429.0,430.0, Yeah.
430.0,431.0, It's got a good review.
431.0,432.0, Okay.
432.0,435.0," I mean, it's, you know, it's a remake of a 20 year old game that, you know, by today's standards,"
435.0,441.0," isn't terribly complex, but I mean, if you remember that game and you like it,"
441.0,446.0," and you like, you know, the old sea air games, this is a really, really good remake."
446.0,454.0, Is it a true like just like line for line text remake of like the entire game or is it just the dialogue is mostly the same?
454.0,456.0, Is it free?
456.0,457.0, It is.
457.0,458.0, Wow.
458.0,459.0, That's great.
459.0,465.0, It's made by a group of programmers that call themselves infamous adventures.
465.0,470.0," It's a, they website www.inthemist-adventures.com."
470.0,475.0," And they haven't got any heat from a Sierra about this or from what I understand Sierra has kind of like,"
475.0,477.0, blessed these remakes.
477.0,479.0," They've said, like, okay, you guys can do these."
479.0,483.0," I mean, as long as they're not selling them for profit or whatever, I just probably end."
483.0,484.0, That's amazing.
484.0,486.0," What a, what a labor of love that is."
486.0,487.0, Right.
487.0,488.0, They're getting no money for this at all.
488.0,490.0," I mean, who gets the time to do something like that?"
490.0,491.0, Yeah.
491.0,492.0, And they look really good.
492.0,493.0," They're like, classic Sierra games."
493.0,494.0," Well, that's great."
494.0,497.0," I mean, actually, I have you actually, actually, I'm a fake curious one of you checked out the silver"
497.0,498.0, lighting.
498.0,501.0," It's another, it's inspired by all the Kings Quest games and they,"
501.0,504.0," I was looking at the website together and I, but I didn't, I had to naturally download it."
504.0,507.0," I actually just downloaded all the, we should play it check it out for next week."
507.0,509.0," I mean, is it just a baby guy? Is it the full game?"
509.0,512.0," Well, the way that I think they're breaking it out into like a trilogy almost."
512.0,514.0, It's like three episodes or something.
514.0,517.0," And since, you know, they've been kind of sleeping away on this thing for a while."
517.0,518.0, Right.
518.0,521.0, They just have that they would just have to release the first segment.
521.0,524.0, So it's supposed to take place after the last Kings Quest game.
524.0,525.0, Nice.
525.0,527.0," Uh, Darren, how about yourself?"
527.0,532.0," All right. Well, I also've been playing Sam Max and I'm a woman at,"
532.0,533.0," uh, let me see."
533.0,536.0, There was something else. I got my hands on a preview build of Gothic 3.
536.0,537.0," Oh, nice."
537.0,539.0, I'm pretty psyched for that.
539.0,542.0, Although on the machine we have that I have at my desk at work.
542.0,546.0," It's kind of dog ass dog slow and I'm having some, some bug issues."
546.0,548.0," Sean, do you ever get yours? We're figured out."
548.0,551.0," No, I was able to install it, but that's pretty,"
551.0,552.0, I don't know.
552.0,555.0," That's pretty frightening if you're, if you're calling the machine that you have at work,"
555.0,557.0, insufficient for this thing.
557.0,559.0, I think it's probably three times the machine that most are listed.
559.0,560.0, That's probably true.
561.0,564.0," Yeah, you should see the machine. I haven't home. I, I built this like Frankenstein"
564.0,567.0," Monster of like, uh, all the high end like bleeding edge stuff."
567.0,569.0," And at home, it looks great."
569.0,572.0, This actually worries me about all these upcoming games.
572.0,573.0, I don't know though.
573.0,576.0, I was warning Darren that I was trying to set things all the way.
576.0,577.0, There's been okay.
577.0,580.0," Uh, a big stink at certain places is something awful for him."
580.0,583.0, It's about your peanut reviewers who are given because the game is coming out
583.0,586.0, being released in the EU before it is here.
586.0,587.0, Okay.
587.0,591.0, And the initial review code that they were giving was labeled review code was very
591.0,593.0, buggy and had a lot of problems.
593.0,595.0, And it caused all this concern.
595.0,598.0," And then a week later though, they issued, they reissued the review code."
598.0,601.0," And that they came back with completely, you know,"
601.0,602.0, positive things to say about it.
602.0,603.0, Okay.
603.0,605.0," Now it's, this is an issue now."
605.0,607.0," They fixed it. So I was wondering Darren, which one you got?"
607.0,610.0," Well, I mean, I was obviously a preview build."
610.0,611.0," I mean, there's some stuff that needs to work out."
611.0,614.0," I mean, and I hadn't had a chance to get too deep into the game because it's a huge world"
614.0,615.0, to explore.
616.0,621.0," But if the interactions with the world in the initial areas are just, it's pretty cool."
621.0,625.0," It's like the next logical evolution and the very step of like if you play Gothic 2,"
625.0,630.0," where it's this huge open world that exists, whether you're doing something or not."
630.0,635.0," And like there's things in the environment, like you'll have hunters hunting deer and,"
635.0,637.0," you know, it'll be different every time."
637.0,639.0," So ecological, it's sort of a good one."
639.0,642.0," I mean, I have an interest really explore how deep into it it goes."
642.0,646.0," But I mean, because obviously like the quest structure and you know, following the course,"
646.0,647.0, but it's pretty cool.
647.0,650.0," I think it's just, you know, that turns out because that's something that's so high."
650.0,654.0," Like, it's an ambitious, but like how much is it really mattered to your experience?"
654.0,655.0, Yeah.
655.0,658.0," Well, you know, if it's falling into forest and you're not there to hear it,"
658.0,659.0, it gives a crap.
659.0,663.0," Well, I think the idea is to kind of convey that like a world that exists with that sort of like,"
663.0,667.0," you know, kind of, it, it away like massively single player, you know, like like like what"
667.0,668.0," like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like,"
669.0,670.0," a w.'"""
670.0,671.0," Mell, oh, bro."""
671.0,673.0," Mell, won't believe in that music."
673.0,674.0, Exactly.
674.0,676.0," For those, that sounds wonderful."
676.0,678.0," I think that's an attention, cuz that sort of Spiral currency ہو knows where I'm going,"
678.0,679.0, so that's called that experience.
679.0,682.0," But you know, perhaps content of the level of the league play,"
682.0,686.0," and you know how you run into it, before going into lekker emotion's doald,"
686.0,688.0," like are you gonna try it at it, or they're gonna try to block it, or else it confused."
688.0,692.0," And then I have to tell you what to do or if you go through your,"
692.0,693.0," you know, if you going through that spirit of music,"
693.0,695.0, then you're gonna make it clearer to create kind of this that kind of go through
695.0,697.84," Yeah, well, I kind of like put a more to the forefront. That's right."
697.84,699.36, What's one of those every living
699.36,701.08, inspires a potential calthic fire?
701.08,704.28," Yeah, and it actually the combat is not competing at this point."
704.28,705.2, The combat's pretty cool.
705.2,708.28," This, I mean, like the, the, the, the, the, the few observations I do have so far is that"
708.28,711.8," when I was able to get it up and running, it's, it's actually pretty cool."
711.8,714.28," I mean, it's, you know, you can do, you know, play in first person,"
714.28,716.6, a love living in our pullout of the third person.
716.6,719.32," Uh, there are obviously little exploits I found in the world already like, I go"
719.32,723.2, bore hunting or something and you can get them caught on the foliage and just start
723.2,724.88, picking away with an arrow or something.
724.88,725.6, Bulls.
725.6,729.76," Is it, are they, are they, are they could be through the geometry of the tree or, or did you"
729.76,731.1600000000001, set a trap or something though?
731.1600000000001,733.6," Well, it's even a trap. I was just like, I was getting chased by a pack of wild"
733.6,739.36," boars and like, I kind of ran over some stuff and jumped through a corner and"
739.36,742.36," they just got, they couldn't figure out the, or back up and come around as a feature."
742.36,744.4000000000001," Yeah, that's not a bug."
744.4000000000001,745.4000000000001, That's a feature.
745.4000000000001,750.1600000000001," Yeah. So, um, obviously it's not final, but then again, you were saying how they"
750.16,754.1999999999999," really, as a review code in Europe and they did that a lot. I mean, like, maybe"
754.1999999999999,757.16," it's because the reviewers there are a lot more lenient with their, with their"
757.16,763.28," reviewing. I mean, Hall of War has came out a month ago, but it is, it did come out."
763.28,764.8399999999999," I mean, it's, yeah, it's out there."
764.8399999999999,767.76," I know that that's what I'm saying is like, it's out there and here, like a"
767.76,771.6, spires intentionally holding it back to do bug checking and like tweaking on it.
771.6,776.16," I suspect, I don't know for Hall of War is here. I suspect it's more of a market"
776.16,776.9599999999999, and timing thing.
777.76,780.0799999999999," Well, I think they actually said they want to do some more tweaking with the"
780.08,784.32," like, actually, change the voice actor and stuff like that. But I mean, it's just, it"
784.32,789.2," seems to happen a lot though. Right. Oh, and what else are there?"
789.2,792.72," I just a quick, you know, I know, I know we can't go on too far. I mean, again, that"
792.72,796.76," actually, I was kind of surprised by that I don't totally hate until it's a very max"
796.76,798.32," painish, but Elm at a door."
798.32,800.0," Yeah, I'm at the door."
800.0,801.6800000000001, It's just the method door.
801.6800000000001,803.48, That'll make a good box for it.
803.48,805.2800000000001, This is a game I don't totally hate.
806.24,807.28, Dan Gladstone.
809.28,810.48, They'll put a sticker on it.
810.48,811.28, Yeah.
811.68,813.28, Cover up the other sticker on the cover.
813.28,818.9599999999999," Yeah, we don't have enough stickers on our boxes. We got a, I mean, on Game Boxes. We got to work on that."
818.9599999999999,820.24, We got to work on our sound bites.
820.24,824.16," So, okay, so we'll have to hold our skills on these podcasts to come up with a better"
824.16,827.52, right. So you might want to hone it better than a game I don't totally hate.
828.56,830.48, Who's that? Who's that? I'll come up with right now.
830.48,832.16, I won't totally dump on the box.
832.16,833.68, Who's the developer for Metador?
834.2399999999999,836.4, I don't know.
836.4,836.88, Santa.
836.88,837.5999999999999, No.
837.5999999999999,838.4, It's a publish.
838.4,839.12, I don't know.
839.12,842.7199999999999," Okay, we just thought we'll just put the usual let the frame rate quick and then the visual"
842.7199999999999,843.28, slick in.
843.28,846.4799999999999, But then I'm bullish for Metador.
846.4799999999999,848.4799999999999," Oh, man."
848.4799999999999,850.0799999999999, Sorry.
850.0799999999999,850.8," Wow, thanks."
850.8,851.12, Yeah.
851.12,851.92, Wow.
851.92,852.9599999999999, Wow.
852.9599999999999,855.76," So, basically a max managed type."
855.76,863.12, It's max that you're a D.E.A. agent in South America and intrigues kind of like you're running around shooting.
863.2,864.08, Things you can hold.
864.08,866.8, They unrealistic you can hold 20 million weapons at the same time.
866.8,869.2," You know, it's basically check your brain at the door and just shoot stuff."
870.24,871.52, It's it's it's all right.
871.52,874.8, That's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's actually priced okay. I mean if it's like a 20
874.8,875.68, dollar game.
875.68,877.52, I can I can say you know it's worth checking out.
877.52,879.28, W the second game in the past few months.
879.28,880.48, Set in Latin America.
880.48,882.48, I was just thinking that Latin America.
882.48,885.68," Just it's not a turn of the sun or I mean,"
885.68,890.8, is it just a coincidence in the same way that like you've got Armageddon comes out at the same time as
890.88,891.8399999999999, Deep impact.
891.8399999999999,894.3199999999999," Yeah, all the end of the bugs life."
894.3199999999999,897.76," Yeah, and sharks and little finding me."
897.76,901.52," Okay, so it's like a sort of like that that zeitgeist of the area."
901.52,902.56, Everyone's thinking about.
902.56,903.5999999999999, Right.
903.5999999999999,905.1999999999999, America's what just cause.
905.1999999999999,905.92, So see at the ones.
905.92,906.56, Yeah.
906.56,906.8, Yeah.
906.8,912.8, And that's another one of those games that was just like it's it's I doesn't totally suck.
912.8,915.1999999999999," But at the same point, there's so many flaws that keep it from being right."
915.8399999999999,917.1999999999999," Once again, doesn't totally suck."
917.1999999999999,919.1999999999999, Sticker and could be worth 20 bucks.
920.88,922.88, I think this is why we don't show up on Gamebox.
925.28,927.5999999999999," Sean, I know what you're playing, but tell us anyway."
929.28,933.5999999999999," More and more company heroes, but I can make this different because I've been playing"
933.5999999999999,936.4799999999999, well to play early extensively.
936.4799999999999,940.0," And one thing I wish we would all play the same game for once, because I want to be"
940.0,943.5999999999999, coming and talking about specific games we played stuff that happened in
943.5999999999999,944.0, him.
944.0,947.04, It was a massive specific game where island and so among men.
947.04,947.76, We didn't.
947.76,949.04, But I like games together.
949.04,949.4399999999999, Yeah.
949.5200000000001,951.5200000000001, Can I be switch or or even playing it home?
951.5200000000001,953.7600000000001," Everyone here was like, oh, this company heroes is hot."
953.7600000000001,957.5200000000001," You know, I'm like, I want to come in the office in the morning and hear some stories about"
958.1600000000001,961.84, some messed up that happened or Sean and I always have loud stories for you.
961.84,964.48, You do. I know that that's that's that works.
964.48,968.8000000000001, But so I've been playing company here as multiplayer.
969.5200000000001,970.96, More and more games different accounts.
970.96,978.4000000000001," And just sort of since I'm relatively new to RTS, I'm just kind of digging aspects of"
978.48,981.28, multiplayer gaming and that genre that I wasn't accustomed to.
981.28,984.72, Is it really the first RTS that you've gotten like this into?
984.72,986.88, It is since like warcraft 2.
986.88,987.6, Okay. Wow.
987.6,990.9599999999999, So it's been a long time and it's to the point where now I'm excited about like medieval
990.9599999999999,991.84, 2 and whatnot.
991.84,995.52," But um, but some of the things are interesting already now is everyone's"
995.52,998.56, smurfing which is basically making a new account with a different name.
998.56,1002.64," So you basically have a clean stat record because what happens is you know, you have a good stat."
1002.64,1004.24," And I had a pretty good, I have a good on my main."
1005.2,1009.44, Nice ratio. It's like 40 to like 40 wins to like six losses or something.
1009.44,1012.64, But what happens is people come in see that immediately leave your game.
1012.64,1016.88," And the big problem unlike you know an FPS where you jump in, you've got a game going."
1016.88,1019.84, You get these scenarios where you're sitting there and sitting there waiting for someone to
1019.84,1023.2," calm. You go to the chat channel, just begging people, hey, come on join my game, join my"
1023.2,1026.64, game and a million other people are doing it. They all sound like you know carnival
1026.64,1031.2, barkers and stuff there. And then the other people in the chat channel are arguing about like
1031.28,1035.44," what we should do about Iran, what we should do about this whether if the the"
1035.44,1040.64," coatings tiger, the king tiger was the best tank ever made, whether their stupid strategy is"
1040.64,1044.48, completely like you know foolproof and they're always arguing about this net and you're like
1044.48,1049.52, he's already hot just going on shut up and get in this game and play. Come show me how cool you are.
1049.52,1053.8400000000001, And then so you finally get that going and then you make a game called like noobs realm.
1053.8400000000001,1058.8, Yeah. And you start playing and it's clear within the first few seconds that everyone in there
1058.8,1064.0, who had basically a clean stat record. Yeah. And it was called himself a new comes in saying like
1064.0,1068.32," yeah, I just got this game from Best Buy right now and ready for my first game and I play in"
1068.32,1074.08, access because I've never tried it. And then you go and play and it's like like I said two seconds
1074.08,1078.08," in they're doing this stuff that only a veteran will be pulling off on you and you're like hey,"
1078.08,1082.24, you blind stacks is shit. You're not you're not doing it. And they all they turn it around and you
1082.24,1085.68, better get on it. You're the same guy. Yeah. You all just tacked it in the world. If you want to
1085.68,1091.2, be guaranteed a play with like four veterans you start a game on noobs. This is the all the
1091.2,1095.8400000000001, tactic in the book but I'm the newest like player in the RTS fold. So it's still exciting and fun to
1095.8400000000001,1101.3600000000001, me to learn the ropes of all this kind of stuff. Right. Every RTS. Every RTS. Then even take
1101.3600000000001,1106.8, it to ride that pretty casual strategy board game that we've got that kind of stuff going on.
1106.8,1111.76, Totally. And this was a game that's you know that like 60 year old you know housewives are playing.
1111.76,1115.6000000000001, Right. But even they have that tag. So the 60 year old housewives are hustling each other.
1115.6,1120.3999999999999, Yeah. They're doing yeah. Noobs only. And then the psych four people who have like a thousand
1120.3999999999999,1125.9199999999998," games to their credit. You know, but they created a new account. Sadly you will run into a legitimate"
1125.9199999999998,1131.4399999999998, new. And when you do you feel you feel so bad. Well you don't. You laugh and and and you're the
1131.4399999999998,1135.6799999999998, only first as you annihilate them. But then you feel bad. And you can always tell in this game the
1135.6799999999998,1140.7199999999998, way you could tell in this game is because people this behavior will be indicative of habits like
1140.7199999999998,1145.28, acquired in other RTSs that are they're fundamentally different from company heroes in the way they
1145.44,1150.0, play out. So you know we start playing these guys and like I throw us you know surveillance
1150.0,1153.36, playing over the base like what the hell are these guys doing? Like they're supposed to be capturing
1153.36,1157.76, victory points. Meanwhile they've got five bunkers up and they're in the process of putting
1157.76,1162.8, MGs on them just just just just propagate waste of resources for no good whatsoever because our
1162.8,1167.6, our main goal in this case is not to go you know annihilate and rape their base. It's to get these
1167.6,1173.44, victory points first. And so you see that and you're like okay well must be an age player and then you
1173.52,1178.56, see the other thing and you're like okay I must be a rise of nation's player and so on and so forth.
1179.3600000000001,1182.8, But it's cool because you can't tell I mean it just sort of shows it up that this is
1183.52,1189.1200000000001, RTS that's unlike the other ones at least in an excluding you know what Ryan is about to say
1189.1200000000001,1195.92," who are hammer 40,000 also by relic and what you're playing now. Right. Say right if you want to go into that."
1197.2,1197.6000000000001, Yeah.
1198.3999999999999,1200.3999999999999, Um
1200.3999999999999,1206.8, My whole problem with playing online is really what you're talking about you know I used to play RTS is online all the time
1207.1999999999998,1214.6399999999999, and now it's just like to scam any other. Yeah all the time you know like I just like I would play with you guys
1214.6399999999999,1218.3999999999999, because like I would I would play with people I know because there's a reasonable chance we might
1218.3999999999999,1223.52, actually have a good game. But I don't want to play with like you know three guys who are just like
1223.6,1228.32, laughing into their team's pick right while they screw me which is pretty much what I've been up to.
1228.32,1233.04, I mean I've been receiving it a lot of times I've learned the techniques for screwing other people
1233.04,1238.6399999999999, by being screwed myself like one one technique that we start using the other day is basically allied
1238.6399999999999,1243.28, rush as hard you save all of your resources in a victory point mode instead of I mean you go and
1243.28,1247.76, cap the resource spaces that you need but you don't sweat make an engineers and I mean snipers and
1247.76,1253.2, MG guns and stuff to like to to fortify what victory points you get instead you save it get a
1253.28,1258.8, half track out have it so that you can immediately send it to the enemies like HQ and UN
1258.8,1262.72, your teammates are both doing this and by the time it gets there it's upgraded to the quad gun.
1262.72,1266.96, At that point it'll just start mowing down anything that they've got building and then you if you're
1266.96,1271.68, airborne as soon as it moves down a few guys are leveled up enough to drop air uh pair of
1271.68,1275.52, troopers and then you just goes from there and you can end the game in a few seconds and then
1275.52,1279.3600000000001, there's the other thing and I might as well say this at first I thought I'm not going to tell people
1279.4399999999998,1283.36, about this because it's too much fun to do and make people just like throw their arms up and
1283.36,1288.1599999999999, fit and start screaming but it's going to be fixed they have to patch this but basically on the
1288.1599999999999,1295.36, access side if you get your grenadiers and you go the terror doctrine and uh you basically rely on
1295.36,1300.3999999999999, the zeal power and inspire the salt and you get what happens is you get your grenadier you equip
1300.3999999999999,1304.32, them with pans or files or pans or sherex and you get them down to one guy by throwing grenades at
1304.3999999999999,1310.0, your own guys and because zeal makes it makes a squad more powerful the fewer people are in it
1310.0,1314.1599999999999, basically it's just sort of like you know you're all my homies died so I'm going to go aggro and
1314.1599999999999,1318.1599999999999, how so you do that to yourself and you let them sit in the back and then you put them in a half
1318.1599999999999,1323.12, track you run that to the enemy's back base and you let him out or as many of these guys as you
1323.12,1327.4399999999998, can make they have to be in their own squad so you let them out and hit inspire to salt and what
1327.4399999999998,1332.0, he starts doing is firing his rocket at every you know main bunker and headquarters with like
1332.0,1336.72, the speed of like a rocket launcher and unreal or quake or something is supposed to be the like
1336.72,1342.48, god-offly slow reload time of a real life-pans or sherex or panzerfals and we'll destroy everything
1342.48,1347.28, in their backfield in in like 30 seconds and we're going to put actually we we made some videos of
1347.28,1351.92, this and we'll put them up on our forums today so if you listen to this you want to go see
1351.92,1356.88, GW forums you can check out a video of this awesome thing you're playing the game in the spirit of
1357.44,1364.8000000000002, a world war two realism first let's throw grenades in our own guys that's the thing is everyone in the
1364.8000000000002,1370.16, damn channel is having these like pseudo like armchair general you know macho nerd arguments about
1370.16,1374.5600000000002, what's the best piece of armor in this game and stuff but the whole thing is it's so game it's like a
1374.5600000000002,1380.8000000000002, sniper can go it can be like 10 feet from someone and they don't see him and we're talking about
1380.8000000000002,1385.3600000000001, open ground he's just sitting like in a field with no grass or anything you know and it's just
1385.36,1389.36, it operates like a game it's still easy to get into the mood if you hey this is world war two but
1389.9199999999998,1394.56, come on man you don't start bringing like real world like armor stats and it now in this and that to
1394.56,1401.36, it it's it's very much a game mr. Malay I haven't been playing wow which excellent
1401.36,1406.32, having me with drawl pains you get like dcs as you're kind of shaken over there a little bit
1407.36,1412.9599999999998, but uh have been playing some match night apocalypse ah that's right so hand yeah
1413.52,1422.72, once again another box club hey shine my life pretty mediocre uh it's that's the back as it
1422.72,1427.68, look good back when we were yeah it's kind of you know it's easy to call it a day out of the
1427.68,1431.6000000000001, hook loan because it's got like you know five characters that you pick from and then each character
1431.6000000000001,1435.04, is the three different talent trees it kind of has that same structure and you click on stuff
1435.04,1439.04, until they die and you click on something a little more a little more complicated than just spamming
1439.04,1444.48, a fireball spell or whatever because you you I found myself doing a lot more like crowd control
1444.48,1448.8799999999999, stuff you know making sure to fear people and root people and I don't know if that's just my
1448.8799999999999,1454.96, title quest uh no I didn't okay it does actually it does feel a little bit more it feels like a
1454.96,1459.84, hybrid of like a wowish and then like an action game as well I mean the one thing you can tell that they
1459.84,1465.28, wanted to kind of tap into wow because like NPCs have the same exact giant uh exclamation point
1465.28,1469.28, over their head if they're going up quest I guess that's a specific coming like a gaming
1469.28,1475.68, convention though now right I mean there's the equivalent of that in uh in guild wars right right
1476.32,1481.76, and uh like do it it's the same thing it's an exclamation point yeah yeah it's pretty much
1481.76,1486.32, same guard it's actually not using that I don't think people don't play wow for the exclamation
1486.6399999999999,1492.0, no I don't know what you're saying like when you see that these rock thieves
1492.0,1499.84, this is a gold art forever like punctuation thieves the biggest problem with it like the
1500.72,1506.96, allied AI like any any NPCs you pick up to help you out like they're just so stupid yeah like they'll
1506.96,1511.9199999999998, just stand there as you go forward and like I was playing this necromancer so I could animate any
1512.0,1517.28, dead body okay like it'll be my little friend like but most of the time like half the time if you
1517.28,1521.52, animate like the world where will if you just kill those is kind of hang out and not do anything and
1521.52,1526.72, that attack and you can't control him directly yeah you have kind of him and so you have been three
1526.72,1531.8400000000001, little mini commands to attack follow and stay and so it's kind of the same sort of stuff is in
1531.8400000000001,1538.4, well sometimes they want to attack if you tell them to that's annoying yeah you know there's there
1538.4,1542.0800000000002, is a thing you're gonna kill something and bring it back to life to do your bidding for you
1542.0800000000002,1546.16, it better really your bidding you know I'm supposed to be controlling that's what I'm saying that's like
1546.16,1550.8000000000002, a new frustration to these type of games is just yelling at you and why don't you freaking do this like
1550.8000000000002,1555.3600000000001, yeah that's it that you get so mad just blow a gaskey it's kind of like a bad wow group in a way
1557.3600000000001,1561.68, we're just full of great box what's to do yeah I have yet anything another fundamental problem
1561.68,1566.0800000000002, I tried playing me on a mage net as well and I guess one thing I kind of annoyed me was it kind of
1566.1599999999999,1569.1999999999998, of masquerades as an action game because you use what you can use was the controls to the
1569.1999999999998,1575.76, computer character and the commission of it I hate this in every MMO when someone throws a fireball
1575.76,1579.6799999999998, or something throws a fireball at you and you run out of a building or you know you want to dodge
1579.6799999999998,1582.8, that you don't want to sit there a weight for the thing to hit you square in the grill so
1583.76,1588.08, and then somehow that magically follows you around the corner and hits you anyhow right yeah this
1588.08,1592.48, is something this is something and it does that in this game a lot it's like a single player game
1592.56,1598.08, or even like a not massively multiplayer game like this like there's certain things that
1598.08,1603.28, massively multiplayer online role-playing is due because of like at work latency issues so right
1603.28,1606.88, you can't dodge other the fireballs way and they do it that way where it's like an auto attack
1606.88,1611.2, like it automatically follows you wherever just because like the logistics of networks right now
1611.2,1615.1200000000001, just don't let it happen and that's completely fair right but like when you're doing the single
1615.1200000000001,1619.28, player game like you should this really know you should be able to dodge yeah and there's so
1619.28,1625.28, a lot of this legacy right because in real life when fireballs are coming at us we don't have
1625.28,1630.96, latency issues right well like I can dodge out of the way of fireball right in just like just roll
1630.96,1635.28, your wife just rolls over and bed and avoids it
1636.24,1637.68, out
1639.92,1642.24, holy macro I was talking about the Dutch of admit
1642.32,1652.32, oh listen we so I've been playing I've been playing dodge or a dark crusade so
1652.32,1658.64, which is kind of amazing I mean so relic put out put out both these games in 2006 the
1659.1200000000001,1664.8, company of heroes clearly an awesome game probably in our shortlist for game of the year so far
1664.8,1670.08, I would say definitely that shortlist and but now they also put out this expansion to dawn of war
1670.1599999999999,1676.0, the second one and it's sort of like the first one winner assault in that it's like you know
1676.0,1681.04, huge and generous and you know pretty great of them to do I think you know because they're not just
1681.04,1686.24, throwing like you do get each race existing rates gets a couple more units kind of the typical
1686.24,1691.1999999999998, thing there's more maps but they added a whole new mega game like a risk style
1692.32,1698.72, meta game of conquering the planet and they added two new whole races and you don't need the original
1698.72,1704.64, of a plan so I do hope that that tendency to expand on things that that frequently carries over
1704.64,1709.84, the company here is yeah I think really explore is pretty consistent about that they are
1709.84,1714.24, on an amazing role right now I mean the only bad thing about uh darker say that would say is
1714.24,1720.0, it's just in comparison to company of heroes now it feels kind of like company of heroes point five
1720.0,1726.72, right company of heroes is such a refined uh and expanded version of what dawn of war was right
1726.8,1730.88, it's a little hard to go back and it's also in terms of the appearance of stuff too I mean like
1730.88,1736.24, looking over your shoulder when you're playing this game it looks good but it looks like it has
1736.24,1740.56, almost the exact same interface as company heroes pretty much the whole the whole set up on it
1740.56,1744.88, but then you look at the stuff on screen and it's just lacking like right you know some of the normal
1744.88,1750.32, mapping and the physics there's no physics really and all the explosions and stuff yeah but still a lot
1750.32,1756.08, of fun and I'm also on the Vanguard beta now I went down to see it last week at Sony for the
1756.3999999999999,1763.84, press event and they they gave us all beta accounts and you know it's it's pretty good so far
1763.84,1769.28, I think I actually my off NDA now my life is saying anything I think so I don't know what let me see
1769.28,1772.96, what's today it's today it's today it's today's the 11th so NDA lifted yesterday so
1773.76,1781.1999999999998, awesome there you go uh yeah so they're an interesting position if you don't know this game this is uh
1782.0,1790.0800000000002, uh the two guys who uh made Everquest originally Everquest one it's Brad McWade and uh Jeff Butler
1790.0800000000002,1796.24, with the two original developers and designers of Everquest and uh this game Vanguard has been
1796.24,1803.1200000000001, in in development for oh my god five years now I think so when we first started singing and it was originally
1803.1200000000001,1810.8, a Microsoft in a Microsoft first party game and now it is being published by Sony so they're kind of
1810.8,1818.0, back home the prodigal sons have returned to Sony online with with with you know a next gen MMO
1819.12,1823.84, and they're you know they're they're currently dealing with the fact that they've got the
1824.3999999999999,1828.8," 8,000 pound gorilla in the room now I mean they essentially they're just even like a name like like"
1828.8,1832.48, Vanguard or something like what is it like what is it conjure like I mean to me like I
1832.48,1836.3999999999999, maybe it's not the case but I mean just what what comes to mind when I hear that as like a box with the
1837.3600000000001,1842.4, hold in the sword on it totally high fantasy like yeah well that's what you're getting it is
1842.4,1847.8400000000001, that's what you're getting um and and but it's not like these aren't dumb guys they're very smart
1847.8400000000001,1853.0400000000002, game designers and they they have a good awareness of their place in the universe and and the
1853.0400000000002,1858.5600000000002, fact that wow exists so watching them develop this game now is pretty interesting because um
1859.1200000000001,1863.3600000000001, they're trying to take those lessons from wow of the things that wow did write
1863.84,1873.28, and they're also trying to make it they're trying to gear it towards a more hard core player but
1873.28,1877.6799999999998, but they're also trying to send the message out that like don't be scared of it if you know
1877.6799999999998,1882.32, they're worried now that that original message like this is a more hardcore MMO it's going to frighten
1882.32,1886.4799999999998, off the or they're worried about that or the PR people worried about that no they're they're worried
1886.4799999999998,1891.04, about it too you know they are they're worried that this perception has kind of gotten a hand because I've
1891.12,1896.1599999999999, seen those kind of weird flips flip flops like say with the splinter cell that's coming out that's
1896.1599999999999,1900.32, on the way um they've sort of done that as like at one point they're talking about how they've made
1900.32,1904.24, it far more accessible and then they start getting worried and you know you see MMO's about how
1904.24,1908.32, no it's deeper than ever and it's like well you gotta make up your mind I mean yeah right going for the
1908.32,1911.92, barnav barnav principle on that yeah that's a better I still have still looking forward to that
1911.92,1915.84, either way I don't care what oh yeah totally complete I just referencing it in terms of like just that
1915.84,1920.32, whole like who is it I mean it's always a cake you need a two thing yeah it is a cake you need
1920.3999999999999,1925.76, to think well what's interesting is that you know the the later game higher game stuff that they've
1925.76,1931.4399999999998, shown and that I saw last week looks really great I mean they have great ideas one thing about
1931.4399999999998,1936.96, coming after wow so you can take wow's what wow did right and wrong and of course learn from that
1936.96,1943.4399999999998, so like one thing they've done wow in in burning crusade the upcoming expansion you are going
1943.4399999999998,1948.3999999999999, to be able to have flying mounts and so you can fly around on your mount in the new areas because
1948.48,1953.3600000000001, in the existing world of orcraft world it would break the game to have been a fly around so
1953.3600000000001,1958.8000000000002, van guard learned from that so the entire world is being built so that you could fly around in it
1958.8000000000002,1964.72, so they can create like whole continents like way up in the air that you can see when you're a
1964.72,1969.0400000000002, lobby or a newbie but you won't be able to get to until you're like 40 levels higher so stuff like
1969.0400000000002,1974.4, that's just kind of neat the dude game worlds play the game it'll I did yeah did you now so aside from
1974.4,1978.3200000000002, talking about you know like the quality of the ideas and this and that your gut reaction or
1978.3200000000002,1984.24, or rather the hairs on the back of your neck did you tell you it's likely that I'm going to like
1984.24,1990.4, A you this will become my replacement for World Warcraft B this is cool enough that I'm going to
1990.4,1994.64, like sit down with it when it comes out I'm going to buy it and I'm going to see if it can become
1994.64,2000.0, either a compliment or replacement for World Warcraft or C like there's some cool ideas here but
2000.08,2005.2, who really knows I mean like what is what is your instinct telling you that that's a good question and
2005.92,2011.36, really I I what happened was we they let us play it all day long on last Friday
2011.92,2017.28, down there so I got my initial character who was a no-musorcerer up to level eight or so
2017.28,2020.88, those now you're just gonna be playing no-musorcerer I like no-musorcerer yeah that's some
2020.88,2024.56, I don't know I'll talk to my therapist or something gone you're starting to hear all your characters
2024.6399999999999,2031.36, the fetishist and my experience and I talked to the developers about it after I played all day
2031.9199999999998,2038.72, my my initial gut reaction was well that that higher game stuff that they're talking about is
2038.72,2045.12, really need I do want to have a flying mount I I would like to have a house where I can do certain
2045.12,2049.6, things on that that would be would be cool that you can't do it well but it's that minute to minute
2050.48,2056.72, those first-rate levels they they're so painstakingly trying to get that ease of use that
2056.72,2062.88, wow has in that friendliness that you know I did ask them like well if I don't know if I bought
2062.88,2067.2799999999997, this game and I don't know about all that higher higher level stuff how am I gonna not think that
2067.2799999999997,2072.7999999999997, this is just a wow clone right honestly that is how that first those first few levels felt
2073.7599999999998,2077.44, in just when you're going around beating on stuff to level up right you're basically beating on
2077.52,2082.32, little spiders that's just like every other look at it this way safe like if some fool can get
2082.32,2086.48, you know whatever and escalate with like 20s or whatever but he's got to work at Taco Bell
2087.36,2091.52, I mean that's that's the sort of scenario we got you got you got to fly mount but what is it
2091.52,2096.96, matter when like the game in this case is like you know working at the 7 famous ingredients at Taco
2096.96,2102.8, Bell right I think it's a the trick is having the game that starts off with giving you a make
2102.8,2106.16, you feel powerful from the beginning to some degree I guess I mean like city of heroes tried doing
2106.7999999999997,2109.68, that you started off with this series of powers and yeah you were just beating up
2109.68,2113.04, guys but you're beating up crooks down the street as opposed to like killing a rat.
2113.8399999999997,2119.3599999999997, Well it's tough I mean you got to capture people within the first whatever half hour 15 minutes
2119.3599999999997,2126.48, even you know and so if your game is about grander ideas and big ideas you know it's hard to
2127.2,2131.52, you know I think they're in a like tweaking were fine midfays and they're the first ones who are
2131.52,2135.92, who will tell you that that I think they're working on this early game experience one thing I know
2135.92,2141.12, this different than wow is you're gonna get your first mount at level 10 which is very early
2141.12,2145.92, compared to a game like wow right you know the mount in wow was like the big thing to aspire to
2145.92,2151.2000000000003, that takes quite a while to get to you're not to level 42 get it so you'll have a mount in
2151.2000000000003,2155.76, Vanguard at least the way it's currently designed at level 10 which you can get in just you know a
2155.76,2160.88, few hours of playing basically it's just like a shrewen bowback horse or something though exactly
2160.88,2165.52, but that's an innovation that wow does it have there's gonna be levels of mounts you know
2165.52,2169.84, your your mount will be able to wear armor they're also talking about combat on mounts which
2169.84,2174.24, why doesn't have either when you say combat it's just like you know you're you're usual combat
2174.24,2180.16, of just like push the one key to your hot key fight and then we'll show that's how yeah that's how
2180.16,2182.16, I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I didn't have combat on
2182.16,2187.28, mounts no just if you get attacked on your back that's how I say those are automatically
2187.28,2190.32, bumped off your ears you know it's long I had combat on mounts
2190.96,2201.76, always see you will stop it was way better back and out the my online yeah I'll keep talking
2201.76,2209.1200000000003, about a Vanguard over the coming week there's a keep playing it is that like in my like wow
2209.1200000000003,2214.1600000000003, guild for example or even among my little friend group like the level of interest is like well
2214.1600000000003,2220.0, I might try it and then the chance of all the people who might try it in your guild or whatever
2220.48,2224.88, actually getting hooked based on what I'm hearing here like within the first 10 levels sounds
2224.88,2229.84, like it can be pretty low then like they'll just go back to about and the like the timing
2229.84,2236.0, is going to be tough because like Burning Crusade is still going to be like is what you can't
2236.7200000000003,2240.88, you can't quote me on it but I believe that they're probably going to wait out
2240.88,2246.96, without Burning Crusade they're not dumb that would be wise yeah yeah we'll see
2247.04,2252.48, exactly as you can quote me on it since I said it public consumption yeah I think they're waiting
2252.48,2256.48, out but I'm really interested in those high level ideas like it's like I've heard about like
2256.48,2261.44, the diplomacy stuff like oh that's kind of an interesting extra sphere of uh game play that I haven't
2261.44,2268.32, seen in a memo to be an in-game politician as opposed to a in-game goal and slayer plus 10 yeah
2268.32,2272.16, no these guys you know they're smart guys and they have good ideas but they definitely have the
2272.16,2278.24, work cut out for them I think it's like a question that that every MMO designers facing you know
2278.24,2283.2, how do you convince people not to play what just turned out to be one of the best PC games ever
2283.2,2288.08, made you know it just comes up in the context every time and it's just that mutual exclusivity
2288.08,2293.3599999999997, of playing MMOs it's not there for other genres you know even genres that you invest large amounts
2293.3599999999997,2298.7999999999997, time in like battlefield or something it's like forcibly when when Quake Wars is out it'll be awesome
2298.88,2303.6000000000004, because I could play I play that for an hour then I can switch over to crisis multiplayer for an hour
2303.6000000000004,2308.7200000000003, I could switch to you know dark mcimult player for an hour where mMOs it's really like if you're going
2308.7200000000003,2313.52, through all that slogging and grinding and low level mounts and whatnot and it's also the money and
2313.52,2318.2400000000002, monthly fee it's the money price I mean it's like a service it's like having cable TV if you're
2318.2400000000002,2324.48, paying $15 a month for this one game what and and you're still into it are you really gonna want to
2324.56,2329.6, pay another $15 a month it's like having you know comcast and then adding
2330.56,2335.84, another cable service because yeah so say ABC came through your comcast account and then you had to use
2335.84,2341.28, like I don't know what AT&T or something to get you know NBC and right at some point you're just
2341.28,2347.04, going to make that choice I just I'm just going to pay the one right stuff that's the problem
2347.04,2352.72, excuse me like it would be like a similar should have helped out for any mMO like not just van guard
2352.7999999999997,2356.8799999999997, right yeah yeah yeah yeah same conversation well I know I'm going to like give them a
2356.8799999999997,2360.8799999999997, name and no comes up it's not world of workcraft the people in your galeer like hon
2361.8399999999997,2367.2, sort of interested well galeer was was able to be confronted by nominally fee right right that's how they
2367.2,2373.2, got away with it yeah how many people can do that you know like that's kind of a fluke
2373.7599999999998,2379.2, yeah it's tough so speaking of world of warcraft though we mentioned the top of the podcast this
2379.2,2388.08, was a huge week for PC gaming on TV there was uh let's see we all know we'll talk about it
2388.08,2394.8799999999997, south park the season premiere that's the highest rated show on comedy central devoted their whole
2395.68,2401.2799999999997, tenth season season premiere to world of warcraft and I think we all saw it right yeah pretty funny episode
2401.2799999999997,2408.48, and then just a few days later on the office on on NBC it wasn't the whole episode but
2408.48,2415.68, it's a significant scene in the episode had the folks in the office playing call of duty on the PC
2415.68,2422.32, so you know I don't like to do too much like the PC rules tough stuff or you know the PC is not dead
2422.32,2428.72, but but that was pretty amazing I thought you had two pretty high profile shows on national TV
2428.72,2435.04, in both pimping PC games and it's good to see someone playing a game on TV that's not controlled
2435.2,2441.2799999999997, through this like pseudo Xbox my drink as controller hybrid yeah and with that you know so we're
2441.2799999999997,2446.88, talking about early with the audio effects coming from a eight-bit era you know yeah I can
2446.88,2449.7599999999998, when you guys do that imitation muckl muckl muckl muckl muckl muckl muckl muckl muckl muckl muckl muckl muckl
2450.72,2454.64, yeah you see a car on my screen you see so playing like some next gen driving
2455.2,2460.72, screen they're holding a controller that doesn't exist in here
2460.72,2465.9199999999996, actually I remember I was watching it was like CSI or something and I'm watching the show and
2465.9199999999996,2470.7999999999997, they actually had sound effects I was picking out as a giorgio revenge from the 2600 and yeah crazy
2470.7999999999997,2476.8799999999997, yeah they're always holding like Atari era joysticks yeah really annoying so so this was actually
2476.8799999999997,2481.9199999999996, two real games that really existed that the well we'll talk about the south park one but the
2481.9199999999996,2486.24, the call of duty one really actually kind of impressed me I mean somebody at active shouldn't
2486.3199999999997,2491.04, did some like amazing product placement there because they're you know they're really playing
2491.04,2495.8399999999997, that game you see it on the screen yeah I saw that clip at a context on youtube and it did
2495.8399999999997,2500.56, lots of I saw and it didn't make me laugh it didn't seem like total product placement it was
2500.56,2506.3199999999997, a laugh that was funny you see the guy you know you can't get around the wall the guy
2506.3199999999997,2510.64, just like wall walking and then the female coworker just shoots him in the head
2510.64,2517.44, how can you not like that but yeah in both cases I don't know the story behind the scenes
2517.44,2522.7999999999997, of either one of these whether you know whose idea was first was it did activism go to
2522.7999999999997,2528.16, NBC and say hey you should put call duty in your show or did the guy to make the office
2528.16,2532.56, really love call of duty and want to put that scene in right and the same thing goes for wow
2532.56,2538.56, and south park you know I don't know who started it but in either case there were huge
2538.64,2544.64, advertisements for these games right well the thing is a lot of people like where I kind of felt
2544.64,2548.48, that that was the case for the office one a lot of people are accusing the south park episode is
2548.48,2553.2799999999997, being a glorified hour long advertisement for for World Warcraft and Blizzard but the thing I was saying
2553.2799999999997,2558.4, is that I see it more as fan service because if you don't already play that game sit back and look
2558.4,2564.48, at that episode and ask yourself does this make is this a good advertisement for playing you got
2564.48,2568.88, lettering I mean you've got them when they sink into the to the end to take out the their
2568.88,2575.6, nemesis or whatever I mean they're just like faces are covered in shakers and boy STD source and then
2575.6,2579.6, I mean the guy is like to crap his mom comes down with the bedpan all that was so nasty
2579.6,2584.8, less than over you know it's like you look at these guys over the guy that the big like
2584.8,2589.92, evil that like barely moves he's got like a risk card on and the only time like he moves
2589.92,2595.84, other than like a risk of his life is a flash or a brush Dorito from his shirt and that's a little
2595.84,2601.04, time for the for it's like you're watching this and you're like hot damn I got to get up in this
2601.04,2606.96, game not an advertisement you know where the worst part is like I started watching the episode
2606.96,2611.2000000000003, my fiance Amy and she's watching and she's like she's like watching south park and she's kind of
2611.2000000000003,2615.2000000000003, getting into it she's she actually pauses it and says can you explain this whole thing to me
2615.2,2619.2799999999997, and I'm like you know and then as you see like the south park getting like start getting like
2619.2799999999997,2625.8399999999997, fatter and like really getting into like the game just like oh that's just funny you don't even
2625.8399999999997,2630.16, you know what they're saying it's like when in the same way that pretty much anyone can listen to
2630.16,2634.56, you know us play this stuff and laugh or whatever I mean they're you know when when
2634.56,2638.3199999999997, apartment is like rallying the troops and it's just like all right I need you to put a
2638.3199999999997,2642.8799999999997, plus for you know man in cap on this it's like it doesn't it could just be sheer knots in the same
2642.88,2647.6800000000003, way that like I'd never and this is an all this is being truthful I'd never got into Dungeons and
2647.6800000000003,2652.1600000000003, Dragons but I could go around and mimic and make fun of the people doing it because it becomes like
2653.2000000000003,2657.92, it's widely circulated enough is this sort of like you know me or stereotype that you pick up right
2657.92,2662.2400000000002, you know you know I know I know I know they're going to plus something with like some kind of like
2662.2400000000002,2667.84, our art item of clothing or a weapon and you're good you know they did you know they did
2667.84,2671.44, you're right they don't make like a good case for like here's something you should really go
2671.44,2675.36, do because look at these guys yeah but on the other hand I thought what was good though is that
2675.36,2681.12, they don't it doesn't have that also didn't have that condescending you know total these guys
2681.12,2684.7200000000003, are loose like they clearly there was a love of the game in there right like they knew what they
2684.7200000000003,2691.36, wasn't into the world scenario I mean it was like a warcraft it was some serious business
2691.36,2696.4, their self park targets are usually pretty like lambasted exactly but they didn't do like a
2696.4,2702.0, Tom Cruise on oh no our craft here you know they were there was clearly a love of the game going on
2702.0,2707.92, you know it wasn't just screw these guys this is the end of society as we know it in fact and these
2707.92,2712.48, guys must place well to warcraft right considering all this stuff they threw in there I mean yeah I mean
2712.48,2719.84, they wrote that and using the in-game footage like for significant fouls or trouble show works
2719.84,2724.4, so well because look at the it would be difficult in another game but it made per I mean in another show
2724.48,2728.56, it made perfect sense in South Park there's the animation so like crap y'all in that anyway
2728.56,2734.56, that like it's not much of a jump between one and the other right it's not like going from you
2734.56,2738.56, know Tom Cruise sitting at a computer terminal saying he needs more ram to hack this computer or
2738.56,2742.96, something but just well that's not Tom Cruise that's a it was a Steven Seagall movie or something
2742.96,2748.48, anyway so like to do what it's about the game footage you know it's just like okay well here's one you
2748.48,2754.32, know like our our full construction and here's another I forget it was it like
2754.32,2757.92, the South Park guys that actually coordinated those in-game scenes there was that all done like on
2757.92,2762.2400000000002, that's been on blizzard there had to be some blizzard involvement because they worked the characters
2762.2400000000002,2768.56, were the in-game wow characters were doing movements that wow currently can't do right so they were
2768.56,2773.04, tweaking with their on and it all the dialogue was lip synced and right well yeah well that was yeah
2774.0,2779.52, right anyway I thought it was pretty amazing just you know I think we can sort of take a little bit
2779.52,2787.7599999999998, of like pride here that like the two games featured were not Xbox 360 games or whatever yeah so
2787.7599999999998,2794.48, oh okay there's like yeah the fact that there was some artistic license taken to make it
2794.48,2799.12, make the show like work well you know such as lips that actually move in construction with dialogue
2799.12,2803.68, being spoken actually pissed off quite a few people it's gonna read a few complaints from
2804.56,2808.56, people that that saw it can before you read this can we note the irony okay
2809.2,2812.8799999999997, these complaints so these are yeah there these are there hopefully ironic complaints
2812.8799999999997,2817.6, and uh factual inaccuracies in the portrayal world of workcraft in the South Park episode you got
2817.6,2821.44, you got to read them in character yeah did do them in so one one person comments that
2821.9199999999996,2826.72, contrary to the implications in the episode character death is it best the minor in convene to
2826.72,2832.3999999999996, world of workcraft overcome with time effort and or in-game money one implication of this is at the
2832.4,2837.52, points accomplished nothing and that the renegade would be back at full strength less than five
2837.52,2844.32, minutes after the end of the freaking episode and then another yeah no character names big
2844.32,2851.92, bones for cartmen and loves to spook for stand with never ever ever be allowed and then uh
2851.92,2858.08, find some other random okay here's the good one uh excuse me but there's no spell that summons
2858.08,2863.44, for scorpions is renegade does the renegade is possibly a hacker modern since he surpassed
2863.44,2868.88, level limits and is able to fight and kill others even outside of duels well the problem is for
2868.88,2872.56, that buddy is that how I mean how did you even get by the fact that he's just player killing
2872.56,2877.04, people at random or that he was supposedly playing the game every single second since it went
2877.04,2881.84, live but no that's not the issue it's the fact that he's something what is this sport for scorpions
2881.84,2886.7999999999997, which part of it tells me more than enough about order about world of workcraft and it confirms
2886.8,2892.48, why don't play it you fight more scorpions in that damn game there's more of our scorpions
2892.48,2896.88, in the lord there's a little bit proud there's a lot if I say that I pretty much read myself out of all
2896.88,2903.04, our pg's and our in whatever you'd call the thing though is a play tight and quest they're called
2903.04,2908.8, scorpions there's a lot of our so it's not exactly killing a scorpion right okay so back okay
2908.8,2913.6000000000004, yeah you don't know what you're talking about yeah you don't understand man you're in there
2914.56,2917.8399999999997, okay so we're gonna take a a slight break and be back with more nonsense
2919.68,2925.6, listen to eGM live to hear electronic gaming monthly editors take you beyond the pages of the magazine
2926.3199999999997,2928.48, extended impressions of the hottest games
2932.7999999999997,2934.3199999999997, shocking celebrity guest stars
2934.96,2940.4, and the newest video game soundtracks
2942.96,2948.96, that's eGM live available at eGM live dot one-up dot com or the iTunes music store
2950.48,2955.6800000000003, and we're back we didn't even really go anywhere did we no but we're back don't break the illusion
2955.6800000000003,2962.48, oh right um so yeah so we're done with the TV stuff are we done with wild
2962.48,2965.04, things we're done with that but it would be cool to see more of that kind of stuff in the
2965.04,2971.76, future so it's well product placement yeah good like i don't like the south park had a good
2971.76,2976.88, handle on it and it didn't feel like probably because ironic enough and it wasn't it didn't strike
2976.88,2981.04, me as being product placement i'll tell you what i liked about both those things so too it's it seemed
2981.04,2986.64, like a very kind of um cultural shift in a way a little bit i don't want to make too big a deal
2986.64,2991.12, out of it but the fact that like all these like grown-up office people were playing this game
2991.6,2996.4, seemed like okay we're allowed to actually say now that this is a past-time people do
2996.4,3002.64, right isn't just like 18-year-old potential you know column buying killers exactly it's just
3002.64,3008.56, like yeah going going beyond that like illusion that you know perception rather that right
3008.56,3012.3199999999997, the media likes putting out there that we're all just one should dumbass well we are a bunch of dumbasses
3012.3199999999997,3019.68, but just to this basically a comment american and and increasingly world pastime that's just
3019.7599999999998,3023.68, comparable to you know reading what you tell motion going movies and stuff and quick aside on that
3023.68,3028.16, uh jack Thompson hate mentioning the guy he's such an odd entity a lot of story but i just
3028.16,3032.48, this isn't really about him but but just this like this this funny forward in this book
3032.48,3036.16, that's floating around the office and uh actually i just floating around the office because someone's
3036.16,3039.68, taking a doing a story on it i'm like come on don't don't get this guy anymore every time
3039.68,3043.04, and here i am doing it but anyway it's a this book is dedicated so and so
3043.04,3048.3199999999997, who was killed and column buying by a video gamer and that was uh and that's pretty much what it said
3048.32,3052.4, but it's like i mean it's like saying so and so who was killed by a television viewer who
3052.4,3056.8, was killed such and such by a food eater who was killed by a person who slept the label so
3056.8,3060.8, you know you know at the one that's actually but it's sort of a tandem at the one that's bothering
3060.8,3066.48, me all these years is you cannot read an article about Rodney King even all these years later
3066.48,3072.6400000000003, without you know what he's called black motorist what black motorist Rodney King
3072.6400000000003,3076.96, black motors Rodney King was killed that goes all the way back to the day it happened it's like
3077.04,3083.6, what is that what he was he was a motorist what is that what is that what is this guy
3083.6,3088.08, i'm sorry google Rodney King and he was black motorist Rodney King
3088.08,3093.36, i'll do that all full see you have to do so anyway just bringing that off just in terms of
3093.36,3098.96, like getting to the point where it would seem as absurd to use video gamer as a pre-fix it's
3098.96,3102.64, supposed to give you any kind of you know serious descriptive information about something
3102.64,3106.64, and then saying that there are a person who reads a newspaper reader such and such or you know
3106.64,3115.3599999999997, like i said car driver jeff green yeah yeah yeah whatever yeah with no more words for that
3116.0,3122.08, that so speaking of a product placement and advertisement and all that we have an interesting
3122.08,3129.12, story from mr. Gladstone we've received our copies of battlefield 2142 yesterday in the mail
3129.68,3135.2799999999997, uh the servers aren't up yet so we haven't played yet and we'll talk about that in a moment
3135.2799999999997,3139.8399999999997, well i i've played but just not the well we haven't played the retail play the retail box coming
3139.8399999999997,3144.56, but the other thing about the retail box copy tell tell what happened when you opened the retail box
3144.56,3149.7599999999998, of 2142 there and actually i'm gonna do it right now on the air okay there he is he's
3149.7599999999998,3154.16, well but i just opened the box you hear that sand effect wow that was wrong yet we need we
3154.16,3158.96, needed to hear you ripping off something and teeling off to you right here here's top of autumn
3158.96,3163.2, i was actually thinking of rumbling paper to say you're a theater of the mind but anyway so
3163.7599999999998,3169.04, as you open up the package this is one like white car or a disclaimer car that you stare right
3169.04,3174.56, at before you like right across from the disc so it says all this kind of paraphrase here the software
3174.56,3180.08, may incorporate technology developed by iGA worldwide the advertising technology the purpose of
3180.08,3184.88, the advertising technology is to deliver in-game advertisements to when you use the software while connected
3184.88,3189.2799999999997, to the internet when you use the software while connected to the internet the advertising technology
3189.2799999999997,3194.24, may record your internet protocol address and other anonymous information that advertising data is
3194.24,3198.56, temporarily used by iGA to enable the presentation and measurement of in-game advertisements and
3198.56,3203.2799999999997, other in-game objects which are uploaded temporarily to your personal computer or game console
3203.2799999999997,3207.36, and change during online gameplay the advertising technology does not collect any personally
3207.36,3212.08, identifiable information about you and EA will not provide okay so basically they're saying
3212.08,3218.88, oh god let me translate attention spyware enclosed yes the short version is you have spot ad wear
3218.88,3223.28, on your computer that's gonna pop pollin pop poll personal information although and on i wonder if
3223.28,3227.44, like the usual stuff like the we do is an ad wear will pick it up when you run a scan that's a good
3227.44,3232.08, question not to try it's i just installed that version the other day so so let's take note of this people
3232.08,3235.52, with the beta contest for themselves as well which has it running i mean you can already see the
3235.52,3242.48, ads for uh in the purple future of 2042 you can see uh ads for dodge uh rams and stuff like that
3242.48,3250.08, as you're fighting in 2142 you can get yourself a 2006 uh 2006 dodge we had a break the illusion guys
3250.08,3255.2, well okay i just i can imagine cruising around like the neo future landscape and my dodge neon
3255.2,3260.4, does that but let's let's break this down i mean because that doesn't particularly bother me i don't think
3260.4,3264.56, i mean i mean that's really bother advertising you know what the only the only um we always
3265.04,3270.0, disdubate and it's it seems like on the average it's pretty tired so maybe we shouldn't like completely
3270.0,3275.68, reworking here but what it seems to come back to is that a lot of safe we don't mind when it fits
3275.68,3280.16, the context yes say for example if you're in saints row a mountain dew billboard is really not going to
3280.16,3284.96, be that offensive because sure enough if you're watching it that's how i feel city right now but in
3284.96,3291.7599999999998, in the in the future in in the frozen i stage neo i stage future of 2142 and the very much purple
3291.84,3297.28, future of 2142 uh that's my character nick too now for this game i don't know how belong all
3297.28,3303.6800000000003, play but but my name is purple future and it it just really pulls you out it just shows you how
3303.6800000000003,3308.7200000000003, completely ridiculous i don't play this game i don't know if i have this like in wow say if you're
3308.7200000000003,3312.7200000000003, fighting against the an all of a sudden like when you kill the ad for depends like undergarments popped
3312.7200000000003,3320.0, up that was not a good idea then it's really absurdly what what what what but yeah it's that but it's
3320.08,3325.52, less the ads themselves and the fact that it's recording my IP it's got the good swear on it too
3325.52,3330.16, yeah i'm not i'm not i'm not too happy with the IP recording i'm not pleased with the like
3330.16,3333.76, to pulling it out of the game play i mean if they actually it made some fake ads like dodge
3334.64,3339.52, silver i would it was going to fake dodge in the future that with a hovercar i could dig that even
3339.52,3344.72, right but this technology bothers me too because in in game advertisement in a game like
3344.72,3349.6, saints row or whatever it is where it's like a one time thing that's sitting on the disk obviously they
3349.6,3354.0, don't have to put a card in your box warning you right because it's just an ad that they paid for
3354.0,3358.3199999999997, but this card is telling me they if they made this card they're scared enough to know
3358.88,3363.36, that they've put something in the software or there's something on their server that's going to
3363.36,3367.68, mess with you in some way or mess with your machine right and it's how it feels to me right and yeah
3367.68,3371.52, I mean clearly they're making it's their scared of something and if they're scared why do it in the first place
3371.52,3377.2799999999997, to save money on costs for you can see from their point of view what they're able to say to
3377.28,3382.96, their advertisers is hey you know you come up with a new ad six months from now and we could throw
3382.96,3388.7200000000003, that get that ad in dynamic into your game that's a great revenue. The difficult thing is that
3388.7200000000003,3395.76, this game does require post release maintenance not anywhere along the lines of an MMO and I mean
3395.76,3400.48, all they do run a number of EA runs a number of its own servers players also pay for and run their
3400.48,3404.5600000000004, own but they also continue to patch it but this is pretty normal stuff you know it's not like
3404.56,3409.2, they're going you know really far out of their way where they say hey if this is going to continue
3409.6,3416.32, we absolutely have to find some way to generate money for this for sure and it's either charging
3416.32,3420.4, you a monthly fee to play or it's putting this stuff in I don't think it's really to that point
3420.4,3425.7599999999998, yet I think it's like I mean it's like an excellent prudent ground for them to test this this
3425.7599999999998,3430.48, whole you know thing out I mean if this is a generally helping keep cost down because they are
3430.48,3435.04, maintaining servers and stuff I can understand to a degree doing something the IP logging
3435.04,3438.88, scares the hell out of me and I just can't really fit I'm not really a fan of that. I mean it's of course
3438.88,3443.92, the EA has been getting your IP for years and years. Well of course they said that this company
3443.92,3447.92, the number of third parties now that's what I'm talking about. I have no idea what they're doing
3447.92,3452.08, right. I know that EA has my IP I know that blows right is my IP. I don't care. What if it's
3452.08,3456.72, some Russian company or something and the facts we this becomes our next big story six months from
3456.72,3461.52, now and like you're saying it has been it's data mining it's doing all these other sorts of things
3461.52,3467.2, in addition to the service that it led just to do through EA right yeah yeah I don't think we have
3467.2,3471.3599999999997, started how far is it. It's like do I trust EA yeah do I do I know the first thing about IGA
3471.3599999999997,3475.52, world what no yeah we don't know anything about these guys other than that they are at a main
3475.52,3483.9199999999996, legacy model technology. We know same guys we just mafia again oh geez drive it end so funded by my
3483.92,3489.6800000000003, I'm sorry I'm sorry it's a weird it's a weird person but but what you were saying to
3489.6800000000003,3495.12, the context when a bother if I'm playing online or something a racing game and I'm zipping by
3495.12,3500.64, McDonald's billboards well whatever or sports game remember and when crazy taxi came out for
3500.64,3505.6, Dreamcast it was actually tried to the KFC drive because you're like that that's like very
3505.6,3510.2400000000002, similar to you know I get to go to Taco Bell like I get to go to KFC or whatever I get to drop the
3510.24,3518.3999999999996, chelupa yeah it's like around for the board but not on other tangent I don't you know I don't
3518.3999999999996,3524.24, like to disother gaming media on you know in public and I don't really want to do that here but
3524.24,3531.8399999999997, I do find it a tad interesting that there's some battlefield 2142 reviews. Yeah very
3531.8399999999997,3538.7999999999997, old righty and even a game hasn't even gone live yet and as we know a print review I mean just for
3538.8,3544.48, the listeners you sweet basically when we finish it it gets put into the magazine and then we
3544.48,3548.4, ship the magazine to you know we do all these things it goes to the printer and there's basically
3548.4,3553.36, a big lag time anywhere between on the low end what two weeks between the time it's finished
3553.36,3560.8, in the tar no member the November CGW the last CGW is not on news stands for one more week and we'll
3560.8,3566.4, be on the news stand we finished it two three weeks we don't want three weeks so so right so lag time
3566.4,3569.92, so basically what it means is that when you're reading print reviews this now is that they
3570.32,3576.56, they came playing that that the reviews is sort of you know found it on occurred at least at least two
3576.56,3581.12, east to go assuming other you know published for the faster so if there's if you see a print
3581.12,3587.36, review battlefield 2142 in a magazine right now that means that they reviewed it about at least two
3587.36,3592.96, weeks ago well no what is this the issue that you that I bought that you borrowed from me no
3592.96,3596.4, us another one okay this is the it's one that's coming out but anyway so the question is you know
3596.4,3601.04, what was reviewed and in this case we just received like it said the box copies yesterday
3601.04,3606.64, all however mid middle of last week we did get a downloadable version of what was called review code
3606.64,3611.92, however no and this is happening the past however no and basically only very few people have access
3611.92,3617.6, to it he is people and then and then you know some people in the press and usually in these circumstances
3617.6,3622.16, and in the past he is said okay we're gonna hold these sessions at the specified times where we'll
3622.16,3628.48, populate servers with our own testers and I didn't receive any notice for anything like that this time
3628.48,3635.12, and even actually you're on vacation okay in the past so going back you know most recently to the
3635.12,3640.16, armored fury play session they held them on three days and they're an hour long and I tended
3640.16,3646.08, all three for that and was there both you know for hours before and after the session and in no case
3646.08,3650.48, was the server ever entirely populated yeah could muster no more than eight or so players to join
3650.56,3656.16, in with us and then the press presence was limited to four which would be CGW game spot in two
3656.16,3662.08, fan sites so just judging from experience I mean I could be wrong there's there definitely could be
3662.08,3665.2, information we don't have and you don't want to make too many assumptions but I'm very curious
3665.2,3670.4, is to what and how like someone could say that they've reviewed it and understand it because even
3670.4,3674.2400000000002, playing single player which of course is not indicative of multiplayer experience you only have
3674.2400000000002,3679.12, access to the 16 player maps in this which are are highly infantry based most of them have
3679.2,3683.8399999999997, no vehicles at all they definitely don't allow for tight mode and single player and it's just
3683.8399999999997,3689.44, this is just a kind of game that it really needs before you can comment on any of the key stuff
3689.44,3694.48, you know is it bouncing and this and that and does it work well you need to play in a natural environment
3694.48,3701.6, you know so anyway that's just the are a little bit rant on yeah I you know not trying to throw
3701.6,3705.7599999999998, stones here just really kind of I just don't even know what it's just interesting what they're
3705.76,3712.48, reviewing right I mean you can't get on now it's like like eight people populating a 32 player map
3712.48,3716.4, I mean that it just seems like a little I mean I'm sure they're hopefully more people in that but
3716.4,3719.76, it's even the version we have now there's no one there because there are no servers all
3719.76,3722.8, it's just really sure I mean I felt like with all the battlefield games you kind of have to wait
3722.8,3726.4, to like go live on the public so you could actually like get that real world experience with it
3726.4,3730.2400000000002, but you have to because I mean within the course of a week people are going to find all this stuff out
3730.2400000000002,3735.36, and I mean and if you go in and say hey guess what this is all all great and well and good and then
3735.6,3740.0, one week later one it takes one player to figure something out and say hey guess what is actually
3740.0,3745.92, completely broken or something and you know I am just sitting playing it I will play especially
3745.92,3750.6400000000003, because you know we haven't been overly kind to this game so far no you've got to I mean yeah
3750.6400000000003,3755.2000000000003, that's been all based on pre release for it has been and the same thing as I mean I can't wait I
3755.2000000000003,3759.28, it's stalled it a lot I got the game yesterday and stalled it the moment I got home and it was
3759.28,3764.6400000000003, hoping to play and see who is online and and their base they're just no servers period so
3764.72,3769.7599999999998, it will be what will hopefully will all be playing it to to give it a shot and I want to get you
3769.7599999999998,3773.12, guys in there let's keep it in another shot now that it's live is anyone going to play
3773.8399999999997,3777.2799999999997, desperate housewives the game that's on my list of stuff that happened this week
3778.8799999999997,3783.7599999999998, this is a game came out for the PC who wants to review it I think it's a give it to Sean
3784.16,3789.7599999999998, Elliott oh god I'm guessing it's a game is it I mean I've got like I have no idea he clips of the
3789.76,3797.36, ladies I'm guessing it's a sim style I think so yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I think I
3797.36,3800.7200000000003, say I want to report that as I think I still watch as a show so I'll see if she wants to check it out
3801.5200000000004,3806.0800000000004, how are we doing on time here we're a little over an hour holy back when he
3806.0800000000004,3811.76, get through half the stuff I want to read a quick reader we'll do a quick reader to do that letter
3811.76,3816.48, and then we need to go finish the first issue of games for one does magazine yeah which is coming out
3816.96,3823.36, well I think yeah it's turning out well we haven't seen one page yet which is a little scary
3823.36,3828.72, since we're shipping in like three scenes and pages well members we have we've seen plenty of pages
3828.72,3832.64, Ryan we're just looking at the reviews open your section I've got a I guess maybe they're nice
3832.64,3837.12, pretty for a game I'm not gonna mention yet but actually I can mention a nice uh and everyone but
3837.12,3839.36, anyway some cool stuff I think I'm a cool stuff I'm a cool stuff I'm a cool stuff I'm a cool stuff
3839.36,3843.6, fantastic I got some good shit we got some good stuff lined up for the future I'm very excited about
3844.4,3849.52, so we're still computer gaming world for those who care for another for those who don't
3849.52,3854.48, weaker too yeah even if you don't care that's a way to cool um then but then we're gonna have to switch and
3854.48,3862.24, we got a switch to spotcast name I'm still like in podcast for windows oh and direct x-men
3862.7999999999997,3867.92, that show wow that show that was these are users a minute yeah if you guys got any more we'll
3868.56,3874.7200000000003, the best one we're gonna use yeah we might just be gfw radio I know who knows we'll say you know
3874.7200000000003,3880.88, after all the the crap that we got for that acronym I'm already you it's like any name I
3880.88,3885.36, am just like words and language it's just like arbitrary it's like the right age just start using it
3885.36,3890.08, but now the we as flipped it's where like I despise it just because I'm sick of the bad jokes for
3890.08,3894.2400000000002, it read them especially from the print and then thus is you know here we are you know like
3894.24,3898.7999999999997, right but don't get over that too right and remember all the shit that the 360 got too
3898.7999999999997,3905.52, no one even think no it's not like CGW or gfw or there's nothing inherently different about
3905.52,3910.0, I mean just in and yeah so it was for the long now so it really bothered me it was like you know
3910.0,3914.4799999999996, how could you go from something as cool as computer gaming world to games like why are gaming world
3914.4799999999996,3920.56, is cool yeah and and the three letter ctw are not cooler than the three letters gfw have it will
3920.56,3925.92, make anything so normal the one the one thing I keep meaning a blog about this the one thing that
3925.92,3931.44, I do understand that people are saying is it like saying you are carrying around the magazine that
3931.44,3937.52, like says windows on it is somehow less cool than carrying around a magazine that says computer
3937.52,3944.88, gaming on it that like the wind the windows you know logo and the windows brand is not as cool
3944.88,3949.68, right I I guess I kind of get that I don't know to say about that though
3949.7599999999998,3954.56, are you gonna be carrying it around you just carry it around with those don't you
3954.56,3959.44, don't you show that you roll that info up you look at the back add and then you judge it
3959.44,3963.04, against the cover and see which is the less humiliating to be seen in public with
3964.56,3970.48, roll it up that's a rush you know I do the magazine flip all the time just like look at this
3970.48,3974.64, add like okay we've got curries like certain touch on the back and then when we got the front
3974.64,3978.96, some dude pointing at you it's like then you open it up and do the weird flip where it's like
3978.96,3983.04, rolled up from the inside I do that with every magazine I'm actually having to do that with
3983.04,3988.16, the book I'm meaning now too I've been reading a lot of a lot of novels I once that I'm proud to
3988.16,3994.4, say I read like the donkey hotel day translation but a noun reading yeah I'm reading some crappy
3994.4,3998.64, sci-fi that has a utterly embarrassing cover and you don't have to go to the assumptions
3998.64,4002.7200000000003, people are making because you make them yourself you're on the part on a train oh yeah no I usually
4002.7200000000003,4006.88, have to book turned over to the other way so because on the back it's just black with white writing
4006.96,4011.92, but I was down home in Los Angeles this weekend and I had the the book on the coffee table
4011.92,4015.92, on my own mother made fun of it she's like like Jeff why are you reading a romance novel
4016.6400000000003,4022.6400000000003, it's not romance mom it's sci-fi it's based off it's cool you could put a really long
4022.6400000000003,4028.8, each other but five years of stress and it's still still a romance novel I can't believe it's like
4028.8,4033.92, but it's constantly walking around with those kind of stuff so wait we can do a real lighter and then
4034.2400000000002,4040.96, we'll go right here all right here's a question from snugs on our forum how good are snugs
4041.84,4046.7200000000003, I want to know what is the worst game you have ever had to wait through all time was the game
4046.7200000000003,4051.92, that was so miserable it made you question your career choice we've had a version of this before
4051.92,4055.6800000000003, I think I think we have had a version of this before we didn't know we had to play for review right
4056.88,4060.08, well I guess that would kind of be the case because it's a good one is that it's a good one is that
4061.04,4065.92, did we answer that once I did because I remember specifically I had to take a take a detour
4065.92,4071.2, in a consoleville and talk about evil day for school booms yeah yeah yeah and sorry snugs so
4071.2,4077.7599999999998, I'm so forth I know I can't tension next time okay just kidding yeah and then it led to the
4077.7599999999998,4082.24, it led to the fun side conversation we just I just know we're totally talking in the time of
4082.24,4086.88, farland game right about that stuff yeah yeah general principle that a bad game is bad enough
4086.88,4090.8, but a difficult bad games is bad as it gets and a difficult bad game is the play for review
4090.8,4095.52, I have an iris right and I will say that you know there's absolutely zero reason whatsoever to
4095.52,4101.04, feel sorry for anybody who has jobs like us right we have very easy lives and very easy jobs however
4101.92,4108.24, reviewing bad games does really suck you know because they do take a long it's like some games can
4108.24,4113.2, take a long time that'll be like 40 hours or whatever in front of your PC just like hating your
4113.2,4117.2, exist it's like that clockwork orange moment when somebody like you know someone's trapped you into a chair
4117.2,4122.4, and you're you know forcing your eyes open it's not really a thing and volume of PC games that
4122.4,4126.72, that come out you know both low it's not what you don't have it so bad is safe you work for an
4126.72,4130.8, online website where you cover multiple platforms and there definitely some people in that
4130.8,4137.2, that sector freelancers that end up reviewing many games in a single week and that's when you
4137.2,4141.5199999999995, can get to the point where you could probably legitimately like start weighing it against other
4141.6,4147.120000000001, career options that might not on the face of it be a sexier attractive and still you know
4147.120000000001,4152.320000000001, and it would still be worth the comparison. I'm definitely not I mean completely spoiled that's a
4152.320000000001,4159.360000000001, hundred percent. Yeah I do enjoy writing about bad games. Well that's a confirming part of it.
4159.360000000001,4166.080000000001, Yeah. I think my favorite review that I've ever read about a bad game was Jason Babler's.
4166.080000000001,4168.56, I knew we were going to say that. Yeah. Well it's a great. It is.
4169.4400000000005,4173.76, He basically former art director of the magazine like six years ago.
4173.76,4177.92, Something like that. Yeah it's about right. He review I remember the game I just remember
4177.92,4183.84, he very descriptive story about how he had to like kill and clean was it for badgers. Yeah.
4183.84,4189.200000000001, And basically said this game in real life. Yeah. And how the game was worse than that.
4189.200000000001,4195.120000000001, Right. He never even mentioned the game at all to just said yeah. Axie right now if you want to see a
