148.68,149.96, Just answer yourself
149.96,151.24, I have a question
151.24,152.51999999999998," It's rather routine, no"
152.51999999999998,155.4," Well, we always go through a very elaborate"
157.4,160.28, Email thread where we better ideas back and forth
160.28,163.16," You know, it's usually we end up with like two pages of topics"
163.16,165.07999999999998, That we have to whittle down to just three or four
165.96,168.2," Before we see that, that's exactly that"
169.16,170.2, Big assell
170.2,175.07999999999998," Yeah, parent and shit. Yeah, usually you have to like three word just like, ah, well, okay"

177.07999999999998,178.76, We've got some magic
178.76,181.56, We're going to we have two games for Windows live
182.76,184.76, Games to talk about or we just talked about one of them
185.39999999999998,187.48," Well, the couple is talking about a little bit more"
187.48,190.51999999999998, A couple of folks a couple of use played a shadow on this weekend
190.51999999999998,193.23999999999998, We've talked to hell out of both shadow run and hailed with two vests
193.23999999999998,197.48, We have so we don't want to beat the thing is that now like we have
198.51999999999998,203.32, Like much more hands on experience with the retail the versions that are you know available in stores
204.04,207.79999999999998, So some of the commentaries changed a little bit a few different things to say about it
207.79999999999998,211.95999999999998," You know, we're not just going to come on here and say Microsoft sucks ass again, but also you know"
211.95999999999998,213.72, We're going to be doing more creatively now
215.0,220.6," Yeah, we'll concentrate what I'm going to go to Resident Evil 4 for PC. I've been playing Resident Evil 4 in the PC"
221.48,222.67999999999998, What else have we got?
222.67999999999998,224.67999999999998, Ryan you got anything at all this week
225.32,227.32, I got nothing
227.32,232.2, He's always trying to force Ryan to unlock I'm level 25 in city of villains go me
233.95999999999998,236.68, Go you we did rebuild the you right out of this room
238.35999999999999,240.35999999999999," Oh, we're going to take the bang zoom"
242.76,244.76, I guess I guess I'll just go
245.4,247.4, Can't leave
247.4,249.79999999999998," Oh, certainly on the Harry Potter this ability cloak"
253.56,255.56, Wow Sean Elliott made a Harry Potter out
256.2,258.2, I only watched the movies
258.2,260.2," Yeah, that's a point of pride"
260.2,265.8, Is so when people try to push that book on me. I am not a muggle. I swear it's a good book. They're good books
265.8,267.88, You've tried to push that book on me. I've read them all
268.36,273.48," All the way from EGM yeah, he wait to push that say he's got good taste and he read them"
273.48,278.68," They're entertaining. Well, well not in literature all he's ever reading and trying to push out me is like alternative history where it's like"
279.24,281.4, What if like an aircraft carrier
281.56,286.59999999999997, Did appear off the fucking coast of Britain in the first world war actually that's bad because they did actually have their
286.59999999999997,287.88, Crack areas at that point time
287.88,293.71999999999997," But whatever so he's trying to pop it up in my encost you know, so he's trying to pop on off the Philip Roth looks on you basically"
293.71999999999997,295.0," Yeah, basically"
295.0,297.0, That was just one Philip Roth book
297.0,301.0, The Harry Potter books are good. But we're off topic. We have a variety of options
301.08,304.2, But then the other topic is we're going to take take some time and
304.84,310.91999999999996, And look into the stuff that we're anticipating most right that's the big the big question posed to the staff
311.47999999999996,316.52, By the staff what games are we looking forward to most in 2017 2008 also
316.84,320.59999999999997," We're gonna take an interlude with geek hierarchy factoids. Yeah, that's not"
322.2,326.2, So let's so we just let's get right into which jelly
326.2,328.2," Who's yeah, we're starting with"
328.2,331.96, Why you guys talk about shadow run Darren and Shawnee were both playing this weekend?
332.91999999999996,337.0," Yeah, we tried to play for a little bit. I enjoyed getting kicked off a lot of servers for deafening people"
337.96,342.52, There was some problems with some there are some sound card issues around and Shaw I first Sean started report
343.08,345.08, He was sending me messages over
345.8,348.28," Was it over a member was it yeah, whatever?"
348.28,350.28," No, I was sending you text messages through"
351.0,356.44, That's right. That's why it games ruined those live right so he's gonna even message over live about how he's having problems with the sound card in this new computer
356.84,359.24, It's not because it has a create a labs card
359.8,362.76, I finally got that new computer in vista and
363.08,368.28, Xfi card do not like one another that and I was fighting the same I was finding the same exact thing this weekend
368.28,371.88, When I was trying to play a shadow run was like the first time to be chatting with people over live and
372.76,377.0, The thing Darren is we were we were having this because what I got this new computer
377.0,379.71999999999997, I took one home that was a test rig in the office Darren got a new one
380.03999999999996,383.24, But we were never aware of it because on your end you would never know
383.24,387.71999999999997, It's not until you interact with someone else exactly. We'd have never gauges as soon as I got in Tina speak
387.71999999999997,388.36, Everyone was like
388.92,395.64, Turn that shit off and then I started playing you know and and before I heard of that I was playing shadow run that everyone's like
396.68,399.72, You need to turn that fucking shit off before we fuck you up
400.84000000000003,401.88, Every single time
401.88,405.36, You made their like hit the mini gun and stuff and they're like do we got a fuck this
405.36,409.56, We got we got a rectus dude and I was like what's going on like it will of course
409.56,416.68," I knew that I was playing Xbox people from from you know those lines rather than PC-plate people, but I guess it was just sending out a horrible"
417.24,424.12, Screaming and hissing to every other player basically all audio that comes out of my headphones is projected back through to them
424.2,428.84000000000003, So if they're commenting they're also hearing themselves through the echo chamber coming back. It was just weird feedback
428.84000000000003,432.04," Lou, but because I had the same problem and I actually was getting so bad"
432.04,433.64, I actually like as I kept yelling about it
433.64,436.28000000000003," I'm saying fine, so I turned it off and was still coming back"
436.28000000000003,439.88, I actually physically yanked the mic out of my computer while I was playing and
440.44,445.34000000000003, That won't do it. You have to shut off microphone and maybe that was a feature on the PC bot
446.29999999999995,451.58, That don't even though like we have to be kind of don't don't a treat me that that's nothing to do with shadow run as far as
451.58,453.82, That's far so interested in my troubleshooting
453.82,460.06, It's definitely whether you want to blame this or whether you want to most people online because I had to do a lot of like searching
460.06,464.38, You know and help forms the stuff are blaming on on creative well the probably yeah
464.38,471.02," Yeah, I won't get into the nuts and both the short version is like creative didn't have drivers up until like basically after"
471.02,474.06, Vista was released and it was just kind of like oh playing a lot of catch fairs
474.06,478.85999999999996, Still good like I guess some people are saying that that might not be told July or August that they get them
478.85999999999996,483.41999999999996, So one actually had something that they say was a leaf version and there was like a CD and mid-Jove it
483.41999999999996,489.65999999999997, So I got that and mounted it on you know an alcohol and that gave me some features that I that I should have already had
489.97999999999996,491.97999999999996," Having the next by card, but it didn't fix the problem"
492.14,496.85999999999996," But that's a whole other you know can't work so yeah, so how was the game part when we were getting kicked"
497.42,501.42," Um, right off the bat as I as I went into it"
501.42,505.98, It was just amazed at how I mean I've said this before that it's basically a console game
505.98,508.46000000000004, It just still happens to play on Vista
509.58000000000004,512.3000000000001, emphasis on Vista because of course you know as we talked about before here
512.3000000000001,519.02, That's the only way the only OS that will play shadow on and we kind of right on that you know just get that out of the way because
519.42,524.22," The game it looks okay, but it's nowhere near is graphically intensive as to to require"
524.7,528.62, This darky x 10 right it's obviously working on 360 which is the x 9 based
529.74,531.74, But so
531.74,534.38, Some of these examples are you know when you go into joint a game
535.1800000000001,542.14, You don't have the ability to browse servers or anything you have a list of preferences that you can click which range from it's very raw skill matching and
543.02,547.5, I generally want a game that has this many players 18 or 16 players or so
548.3000000000001,552.0600000000001, Maybe I like these maps and I can kind of hope for them. I could I can list them as it's you know
552.06,555.42, Like sending letters to Santa Santa I hope I get a game with no
557.0999999999999,562.2199999999999, Too tough you know maybe we can play on one of my trips and you send that and then you wait
562.78,565.5799999999999, Five to ten minutes and of course those numbers
566.78,568.78, Extreme they five to ten minutes really
569.9799999999999,573.5799999999999, I went and started timing it again because people were calm bullshit on it
573.5799999999999,576.6199999999999, I was like maybe I am just exaggerating without being aware
576.6199999999999,579.9, And the first time I time it I got night if I had perhaps on that machine
579.9,582.14, I would have made a YouTube video put it up there for the world
583.1,586.78, Some commentary. Can you tell it like how long to wait for those exact
588.3,589.8199999999999, You see a loading screen
589.8199999999999,596.4599999999999, I know and that in the ten minute wait is searching with no preferences whatsoever throw me whatever the fuck you got and I'll play
596.4599999999999,598.4599999999999," Yeah, that's because there were no games up"
599.02,600.6999999999999, There were games up. I think it's a matter of
601.1,602.6999999999999, 360 players that have got it
602.6999999999999,604.6999999999999, Is running to somebody
604.6999999999999,608.9399999999999, True skill system we kind of say that's a trademark name so apparently trying to look play matching
609.5,613.1800000000001, I don't know what to deal about it's not even that much of a disparity between anyone skill level
613.1800000000001,615.1800000000001, I know that's exactly it
615.1800000000001,617.1800000000001, I mean she's like fire about
618.3000000000001,624.7800000000001, Can you so can you do it all that works works well that works as your custom to on live?
625.58,629.5, Now the problem for me is that you know when you play the game you can't you know you can't
629.5,632.3000000000001, Feel there are select servers and say you know exactly here's an on-play
632.3000000000001,636.1400000000001," I could look there. Oh, it looks like they got a couple bots it looks like so and so's in here"
636.3,642.46, I'll go in here can't do that can access your console you know if it's till the key or whatever to to look at your frame right
642.46,645.9, So to do the usual type of manipulation that PC gamers are custom to
646.38,651.98," While you could argue that oh well, that's the whole point of games for Windows and the mission and stuff is to take away all that stuff"
651.98,657.98, It's at least at least I mean you can give the easy option and the accessibility option for people who want that
657.98,664.86, But for the rest of us that don't think it's a burden that think it's actually like a great tool to be able to filter the way we want to be able to
664.86,669.66, Tap text chat in the game because both of our mics weren't working. That was exactly because we can't
670.22,673.66, No hit T or whatever key we you know we you know we bind so there's not
673.66,678.62, I just chat there's no text chat at all. I was so hoping to just communicate with somebody let them know and the only the only option you have
679.26,685.26, If you can't if you can't get voice working which we couldn't is like I guess it's map to the ZX and C keys is like
686.22,689.74, Status update for yourself like you know if you if you do the resin somewhere or like
690.46,692.0600000000001, You know need it need backup at this location
692.0600000000001,692.86, You're a medic
692.86,694.86, Exactly
702.86,707.5," Sound bite oh my god, I'm so gonna hack it and put that in now"
707.74,714.22, The thing about what I've heard you've seen I mean message board wise shadow on is the big topic this week
714.22,718.54, You know it just keeps appearing and we're actually locking through right on it in our forms because we have an official
719.18,724.6999999999999," We have both in the official thread for general discussion and a PC specific, you know trouble shooting and one on thread and then that's cover"
724.6999999999999,730.62, But everyone this talking about it and their reviews are going up and everyone is quick to to comment on the usual stuff
730.62,733.66," Which it doesn't have enough maps doesn't have enough modes, but when I'm playing"
734.54,739.0999999999999, At that point when I first play the game none of that stuff matters to me because if I'm having fun
739.0999999999999,743.98," I'm like well, that's fine. I'm trying to learn what maps there are in one mode right I'm not worried"
743.98,745.98, I'm not looking out that far into the future
745.98,751.02, It's still I have to start having like a genuinely amazing time and I'm like damn this is great
751.02,754.78, And I want to make sure there's like a big stack of this drug to last me for how long
754.78,759.4200000000001, But the thing is it's not even it's not like you know people are calling a fun and intense and you know
759.66,766.38," Hey, you know, I can't I can't argue with them for whatever their their level of enjoyment is that's great. I wish I would enjoy the same"
766.86,768.54, but
768.54,770.54, Playing on the PC site. It's it's neither
771.26,773.82, It's not very fun. It's definitely not intense and
774.22,780.3000000000001," Some of the stuff has to do with just the the nature of the game, you know being ultimately I think design for console"
780.3000000000001,782.3000000000001, And they found a way to balance it with
783.2600000000001,787.98, You know where they're people with keyboards and mice playing against people with controllers and some of the stuff
787.98,792.7, They've done to do that is really annoying. It's like you know when you mouse looked too much you get a
793.74,795.98, A handy cap in the form of reduced accuracy
795.98,802.46," Your targeting cross hairs will expand out and of course, you know your shot will fire somewhere random within that like expanded circle"
803.1,808.7, That's if he's mouse looked too much if you if you rapid move say if you do a quick snap 180 because you know
808.7,812.22," So it's come up behind you the usual stuff, but obviously, but if you spent your whole if you"
812.7800000000001,816.5400000000001, Played PC shooters for any like the time you're gonna do that. You're gonna do that right
817.1,818.5400000000001, General
818.5400000000001,822.38, Accuracy stuff you get you get like reduced accuracy in general
823.58,826.86, And because of it like otherwise you would you would just
826.94,829.34, Descimate people with headshots over and over in the game
829.34,833.1800000000001," That is a fundamental difference between two, but but what happens is when I'm playing it"
833.1800000000001,838.22," I can't tell that I'm hurting someone it looks like I'm hating them, but I can't they're not nothing's registering"
838.22,840.22, It takes so much ammo to hurt anyone
841.26,846.62, The guns don't feel like hey all all and all it just feels so squishy that I'm like I don't feel that
846.62,851.26, Empowerment of like you know when you hit someone it gears a war they're leaking blood and they're like
851.58,856.46," And you're like okay, I'm doing something even in quick three you get the thing thing thing thing thing thing"
856.46,858.7, You know when you're like him someone like okay
858.7800000000001,862.0600000000001, At least I know like I'm actually shooting both this thing
862.3000000000001,866.94, But you know I don't get and I don't pick up any of that even using the the act even using the like the rifle
866.94,871.6600000000001, You figure that you have some sort of accuracy or like you try to pull off a headshot and you still can like we yet
871.6600000000001,876.0600000000001," Yeah, even with the rifle it's okay, but it gives you you basically have to like"
877.1800000000001,881.82, Click pause click pause otherwise you're gonna get even a burst is too much right you're acting your shots
881.82,884.62, You actually one thing I was curious about I didn't get a chance to try this
884.7,888.7800000000001, Did you actually try playing with a game pad on the PC version to see if that actually changed the accuracy
888.7800000000001,893.9000000000001," I just plugged that in and restarted it, but I couldn't I could get it to works like it's like man"
893.9000000000001,896.5400000000001," You didn't stop with it, but it wouldn't take control you shouldn't be gimp"
896.5400000000001,902.46, And right on the game pad on the PC right no it should it would be fall back to the right way
902.46,905.58, That's what I mean like that's the only work right I get think of but still it's kind of pathetic
905.58,910.3000000000001, You have to like switch over to a game pad on your but you see it on it like this stuff is very
911.18,913.42, You know I'm looking at it and it's like okay great you play a game
913.42,915.8199999999999, You don't like it so much big deal you say that you don't like it
915.8199999999999,919.8199999999999," But here I was getting really upset you know, it's like why am I getting so angry at this you know?"
919.8199999999999,921.8199999999999, It was like offensive to me and it's like because
923.18,929.9, Of the position of the game they say okay this is going to epitomize this brave new step into both cross platform play
929.9,935.0999999999999, It's the thing is that we're gonna be doing with windows and your PC is a gaming platform and you look at it
935.0999999999999,936.6999999999999, And it's supposed to be this you know this
937.26,941.98," Wedding of two worlds of PC and console, but they don't even meet us halfway in the middle"
941.98,945.0200000000001," It's like a big like thought you know, it's like a big middle finger to us"
945.34,947.0200000000001, It's like hey
947.0200000000001,950.7800000000001, Here's this brave new future you're basically playing a fucking console game on your like
951.4200000000001,955.82," 2,000 r pc and you can't even access the console or do any of the things that you want to do"
956.1400000000001,961.5400000000001, Right the wedding should have actually have PC gamers play the way PC gamers play it was more like a shock
961.62,968.02, The very fact that you mentioned that on one up. There's two threads one the gameplay through and the others the PC trouble shooting thread
968.3399999999999,974.66, Like well great once again great advertisement for PC gaming. I find very few pieces
974.66,978.8199999999999, I mean come to some of it's gonna be because of the inability of people to play the donor
978.8199999999999,980.3399999999999, You know that don't have this stuff
980.5799999999999,985.2199999999999, But everyone was so excited because they're cross platform achievements say they revive a PC player
985.2199999999999,987.38, Certain amount of times or something like you know whatever
987.46,993.46, Kill one and everyone's like oh crap. There's someone on a computer in here. There's someone on a computer
994.02,997.54, That's like I'm was like where are they from like an article or something?
998.26,1002.5, They talking about a computer and like they I thought this was supposed to be cross platform
1002.5,1006.66, Everyone's like oh shit. Who's doing that and then they figured out that it was me with the mic problems
1007.86,1010.26, And then they all like just started to hear computer boy
1011.86,1014.1, Can they tell when you're playing if you're on a PC
1014.1,1019.0600000000001," I know that there's actually a little marker next to your yeah, miss that you think really"
1019.3000000000001,1022.82, We have cast lepare I knew that they were on Xbox because of odd
1022.98,1027.22, They were talking through their mics and had that very distinct diva. It's like a yellow triangle
1027.22,1031.3, If you go up on live usually like it'll have a little marker now if like you're on a console
1031.3,1035.22, I mean if you're playing a lot of PC and someone else is on a console is a little like gamepad marker next to
1035.46,1040.1, Is that when you're some kind of tab out and look at scores or is that just over their head when you're playing them?
1040.1,1042.9," Oh, no, it's not it's not like when you're playing in game, but if you check out the scores and things"
1042.98,1045.7800000000002, You should be able to see it like why did they have to do that the other
1046.3400000000001,1049.22, It's like the dragon right the sneakers and the starbell eats niches
1049.5400000000002,1051.5400000000002, How do we have to do what though?
1051.5400000000002,1053.3000000000002, How to do what though kind of glad that
1053.7800000000002,1055.94, Because if you're going to have achievements for it. You're going to like
1056.18,1062.26, I got to know who they are the other thing is like what about the ability to choose a server that's all of like that's PC pure
1062.26,1064.26, What's so you're or that's like strictly mouse
1064.74,1068.26," So since we talked about it's not necessarily the it's controller, you know like"
1069.22,1075.06, And this is sad too the fact that you're like here I am with the mouse keyboard worrying about like avoiding control
1075.06,1078.02, You know it should be it should be ducks in a fucking barrel
1078.02,1082.82, It should be this is great like let's find a bunch of controller servers going there and just like annihilate them
1082.98,1084.98, But then it's a so-so in a barrel
1088.58,1091.62, I never mind that's also easy to hear so
1092.02,1094.02, Equally easy to shoot so
1094.82,1096.98, The other thing that was knowing as well is looking on their website
1096.98,1101.1399999999999, You know there are community manager whenever's talking about the ways in which they they balance the game
1101.78,1103.78, And he's just so excited to say that like
1104.42,1108.66," You know, yeah the the mouse players and our in our QAT we're finding and even you know"
1108.66,1113.3, They're not they don't have that much of an advantage but then he goes on to explain all the things I did that
1113.3,1118.42, They've got you know accuracy handicaps and all these other things based on movement and it's like any still
1118.42,1125.54, Gloding like what the fuck well and then you post this publicly like thinking that your PC potential PC audience is not gonna look at that
1125.54,1129.7," Right, oh this is supposed to be a sales pitch right all right. I'm gimped and"
1130.9,1136.18, And then it's such a like they so want to say that like oh this is just this this perfect ideal solution
1136.18,1141.14," We have and and we found that you know while PC pit player, you know people who using a mouse do better at long-rage"
1141.54,1147.38, The controller-based players have just this this huge advantage up close because they're able to work the button combos faster
1147.46,1152.3400000000001, And this isn't a game about headshots. It's a game about you know combining at tech go actions and stuff
1152.3400000000001,1155.7, But I'm like even that dude had you ever watched people play any
1156.3400000000001,1162.1000000000001, I mean even world of warcraft if you're if you're in high level plan that with your hotkeys or basically any PC game
1162.18,1167.38, Where your your fingers are working like 10 buttons at a time in combination and all this stuff
1167.7,1174.3400000000001," It's yeah, I know less world of warcraft than like a fast base art. It's not it's not necessarily you're but like I've got five buttons on my fucking mouse"
1174.34,1177.62, Like if you wanted instead of just having three slots for superpowers
1177.62,1181.62," I could have five and I could access them all with with one hand, you know"
1181.62,1185.3, I mean so that's stuff's just a bunch of nonsense and it totally pissed me off. Well
1185.3,1191.3799999999999, I totally brought out like the the whole like PC versus console with me that I tried to avoid because I play both
1191.3799999999999,1193.06, I was like this is just annoying
1193.06,1196.34," Yeah, you're totally hitting on something there because I was thinking the same thing as I was trying to like"
1196.8999999999999,1199.86, Remap that it was like that damn it I had this fucking mouse that I you know
1200.5,1202.02, You know cost 70 bucks
1202.26,1206.42, And I should be able to like put that up is maximize for the three available sold from it
1206.42,1210.82, That's exactly it xbox 360 so that's when you're basically saying okay screw it
1210.82,1217.1399999999999, I'm gonna just don't want to gamepad because right and then that was saying like they didn't really try that hard to make it work on the PC
1217.3,1219.3, Now they kind of did
1219.86,1226.18, Maybe not the minimum right but they didn't go out of their way to say let's make this a PC experience for the PC game
1226.18,1228.98, They brought it down to the console and it's and it's far too making it a multi-
1228.98,1234.34," Well, it's not it's not even just doubt it's just they're different you know, and you have to acknowledge those differences and"
1235.14,1237.14, And there's more to it than just like
1238.82,1240.82, Just that that that that that's
1240.82,1245.14, I think just like something of like all the server browsing crap that you had that we had to we had to put up with this weekend
1245.14,1247.6200000000001, And just the way it was laid out I keep thinking back I
1248.18,1252.18, Know that they're trying to make this like the ultimate multiplayer game that I can't help but think the original
1252.42,1255.6200000000001, UT in 99 right when I came out I did everything so much better
1256.1799999999998,1257.54, I mean you know
1257.54,1260.26, And you're paying for this with gold membership
1260.26,1265.6999999999998, That's right. I mean like I mean that game had bots that game had multiple modes that had like I mean a salt mode
1265.6999999999998,1267.6999999999998, Which was fantastic and
1268.7399999999998,1270.5, I'm just I'm saying a team fortress
1270.5,1276.26," Right, right if you compare to any basic multiplayer PC shooter the team fly with a PC player one"
1277.62,1280.1, Exactly how would I've met interface?
1280.5,1282.5, Yeah
1282.5,1288.34, I think it was to just play against like I'm friend you have we just has a 360 like you really want to play something together
1288.34,1289.86, So that's it yeah
1289.86,1294.1, Here's you know at the part that early pissing me off this game was in development for what four freaking years
1295.2199999999998,1296.74, This is what they came up with
1296.74,1299.4599999999998," Well, I'm guessing it had an underwent some radical change exactly"
1299.4599999999998,1302.26, Remember time so you're not looking at a cumulative four years of work
1302.26,1308.1, But that's exactly it reboot date some point in between remember last week when I was kind of I had that crack pot theory about how
1308.74,1312.74, It's gonna be a it's you know it must have been a single player game at some point. I actually
1313.3,1314.8999999999999, Talk to somebody recently who was actually
1315.62,1319.82, Going to work there and they actually did have a full single player game like basically got ripped out
1320.1799999999998,1322.1799999999998, We're
1322.1799999999998,1324.1799999999998, Is it all your other details about it?
1324.4199999999998,1329.9399999999998, Without incrementing them I don't want to like say anything else but that was in there at some point and basically they just in one point
1329.9399999999998,1332.8999999999999, It's not an incrementing though because I mean they didn't I but they don't advertise
1332.8999999999999,1336.98, I bet it's pretty obvious the game feels like half of what it could have been
1338.1799999999998,1342.8999999999999," Again, I'm just taking my my my position on that because like even you know when I walk around the halls early"
1342.8999999999999,1346.98, I went over by EGM to get a red bull and one of the game videos in turns was talking me about it
1347.54,1351.86, First thing that came up was like not enough maps of modes and I'm like again if this was an amazing game
1352.1,1356.34, You can give me the maps of modes later like you give me a rad-in-of game like right now
1356.34,1360.08, I have way more fun playing the Halo 3 beta. That's got three maps. You know
1360.58,1365.78, That's very true and that's enough to know like this is cool. I want to keep playing but I play that and I don't even want to keep playing
1365.78,1370.42, So like wait I'm not even gonna get to the point where I'm like wishing there was some single player
1370.42,1376.48," All I know is like I agree. Yeah, that's kind of a weird argument. Yeah, that there need to be more when it's like that"
1376.48,1380.44, I'm not even saying more but like the fact that had all this time and all they wound up with was
1380.44,1383.3799999999999, I don't even talk about levels. I'm not even talking about like the number of levels
1383.3799999999999,1390.5, I'm talking about the design of said levels and the character you know and the race and the race is in the weapons and right and stuff like that
1390.5,1393.62," To be fair a lot of people are posting that they love it, you know"
1393.62,1397.3," They're a bunch of people. Yeah, exactly so don't don't take you know"
1397.3,1402.7399999999998, I don't know I would say take my word for it if you're PC player and you're used to games like that are
1403.3,1407.84," You know, I mean you're just to playing the sort of multiple player PC shooters that we all know and love then"
1407.84,1409.56, I would say maybe wait my words more heavily
1409.56,1411.86, But if you just like if you're thinking of three six year whatever
1411.86,1414.7399999999998, Hey listen to these guys they out they a lot of them seem to love it and
1414.7399999999998,1420.7399999999998," Well, this is not my gaming podcast. Yeah, we're given the PC gaming perspective right and maybe there's people that love it on that"
1420.74,1423.6200000000001," You I just haven't run into them. Yeah, yeah, actually I mean I found it"
1423.6200000000001,1428.06, I mean I actually played both this weekend on the console and the PC and I did find the console experience a little better
1428.06,1432.06, But because I you have a certain set of expectations for a first person shooter there right right
1432.06,1434.6200000000001," So I mean like in that respect. Yeah, it's kind of a success"
1434.6200000000001,1441.22, But for anyone who's you know grown up on UT and stuff like that and this definitely doesn't feel like the melee is like
1441.22,1445.22," Jank to mean to yeah, that's like it's for one when you have a mouse"
1445.22,1448.18, It's really senseless that you go into third person with that sword
1448.74,1452.82, Because I can turn fast enough to turn around and engage people and then you're like
1452.82,1458.06, I think it's just this big weird swing and you get hit with it or commercially like the hit detection
1458.06,1462.82, You'll do damage to people and you're looking at your screen. I'm like I'm not physically even hitting that person
1462.82,1466.98, I know I was saying it's the same choppin them down and I don't know
1466.98,1469.5, I thought that was pretty like that was definitely one of my
1470.46,1472.46, Least favorite melee
1472.46,1475.1," Oh, I know as I kept getting a cheap in points"
1475.1,1477.42, I kept hanging my head lower and lower my dude. I don't want
1477.42,1482.62, I want people to know so how many PC players did you run into while you were playing we were like alone in the crowd?
1483.34,1487.74," Couple yeah, I ran it I ran it I ran it's I ran it's a scooter online in one game"
1489.22,1493.18, But you know it's a few and far between and I hope you gained them good. Oh
1493.18,1496.46," Actually, that was one of the games like I kicked from in five seconds because I couldn't talk"
1497.42,1499.42, I have no mic and I have my screen
1501.5,1504.3," Yeah, I think I burned out on the shadow around him"
1504.3,1508.42," Yeah, yeah, they're they were why can't say going to an even worse port"
1511.26,1513.26, While we're complaining
1513.66,1520.06, Resident Evil 4 for the PC I started playing it this weekend at home and I was having all sorts of
1521.02,1526.7, Interesting problems with so I came in here today to see if that was just me at home and in fact
1526.7,1529.1799999999998," No, it's the game the port does suck right"
1530.06,1535.74," Looks great. Yeah, the graphics though were when I came in they look nice. Yeah, and you have to say that because the idea"
1535.74,1538.06, Euro version their release didn't look so hot and then
1538.22,1541.4199999999998, Word is that the we the we version they just released doesn't look so hot
1541.74,1545.1799999999998, But the textures look great even at that on the resolution of your monitor
1545.34,1549.8999999999999," Yeah, the PC the US version of this PC port which just shipped"
1550.1399999999999,1553.34, Which I have they did up the the graphics
1554.3799999999999,1559.98, I guess it was the textures that they that they improved on and it actually looks pretty sharp and that's about is
1560.3799999999999,1562.3799999999999, All the good you can say
1562.3799999999999,1565.4199999999998, About this part that the main one being no mouse support
1566.46,1568.46, Hi welcome to 2007
1569.1799999999998,1575.4199999999998, For mouse support in a PC game and by no mouse support. You mean not even like in the menu? I mean no mouse support zero
1575.42,1580.0600000000002," Yeah, you can't even you can't even pick new game on the on the loading"
1580.0600000000002,1587.02, So how is this a play the game of just keep word only if you didn't have a game of any you don't have your controller with a mouse right right
1587.02,1589.42, You have to like know you can't do anything with the mouse
1590.46,1594.46, Zero mouse support whatsoever even though actually on the box it says requirements
1594.6200000000001,1596.6200000000001, Mouses on there
1596.6200000000001,1601.1000000000001," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got double from windows double click on the install"
1602.06,1608.3799999999999, So right if you don't have a gamepad you're stuck using the keyboard entirely
1609.4199999999998,1616.86, Holy crap so to fire you you press shift to raise the weapon and then enter to shoot it
1617.4199999999998,1619.6599999999999, The other way
1619.6599999999999,1621.6599999999999, Was the
1621.6599999999999,1625.58," Yeah, it's to move around while carpal tunnel doctors around the country are celebrating"
1625.58,1628.9399999999998," It's horrible. Yeah, it's it's gimped beyond believe"
1629.26,1634.38, I mean you would just assume that because when you when the PC version was here like I think that might be cool because
1634.8600000000001,1641.98," You can use the mouse to shoot and that would be red, but that would be red. It's not gonna hurt it if you're if you're getting those dudes"
1642.06,1645.42, Right pin point where you want that that game will just become like all the more fat
1645.42,1646.7," Totally, right"
1646.7,1650.14, What it's like what I hear about the Wii version is right. I mean I played the
1651.26,1656.6200000000001," Gamecube right you came in on game first, right? Yeah, okay, so I played that when it came out and I had trouble playing it"
1657.58,1659.9799999999998, Because I wasn't used to that style of game
1660.62,1666.1399999999999, Being more with PC guy and so I didn't I never finished it on the game cube and when I heard they were porting it
1666.1399999999999,1673.5, I was kind of like wow cool now it'll finally be on a machine where with a controller a control scheme that I'm used to
1674.3799999999999,1675.58, But no
1675.58,1680.86, What so what about the real extent what's the the the absolute extent of
1681.26,1684.2199999999998," The lack of oh yeah, thank you for prompting"
1684.7,1689.42," Yeah, there's the note there's so there's no mouse support which is a problem in and of itself"
1689.42,1696.22," And I did play it after that with the 360 controller plugged into my PC and that's fine, but then of course"
1696.6200000000001,1701.26," Why not just play it on the console, but the other great problem is there is no"
1701.98,1703.98, Way to quit this game
1703.98,1706.22, You they forgot to put in a
1707.02,1712.22, Quit button it's even completely right. I mean you can't quit well. There's a way all tab
1712.22,1716.94," Well, that's what you have to do you have to alt tab and go to task manager or"
1717.5,1719.5," Yeah, you told me you can"
1720.38,1722.38, You can
1722.38,1724.38, You can
1724.38,1728.78, You can close it from the tray or or do what I did and go to task manager either way
1729.02,1734.3, Should have to leave the game and go to windows to quit your freaking game because the start button is all different
1734.3,1740.6200000000001, That's nice. They just do this right up code trans point. Are you positive though? Do you have the equivalent of a select button bound or whatever?
1740.9399999999998,1742.9399999999998," I've got it. Yes, okay"
1743.34,1752.2199999999998," If anybody wants to correct me on this, you know find it if it's from whether you're just a random person listening or if you're from Ubisoft if there's a quit button"
1752.2199999999998,1755.9799999999998, You show me because I spent you know the bulk of the day looking for it
1755.9799999999998,1761.8999999999999, So that I wouldn't come on this podcast and say something inflammatory. I couldn't find it and so even if it is there
1763.1,1765.1, I want to put some looking for it that like
1765.9799999999998,1767.9799999999998, What about the hack?
1767.98,1775.18, So there is so I did search online to see if I was smoking crack about the lack of mouse support and I discovered that that in fact
1775.18,1781.9," There is no mouse support, but that some other annoyed PC gamers wrote a mouse hack that you can download"
1782.38,1785.98, So I am gonna die that if it works because I really want to play that again
1785.98,1787.58," Yeah, let me know I'm gonna check it out"
1787.58,1789.58," Yeah, the second disc"
1789.58,1793.98," I mean I know there's not gonna be bad on this, but the the second disc in the game Q pose really awesome to"
1794.3,1800.54," And there's so much stuff you don't want to miss it. Well, I know that the game has a great reputation at one most game of the year awards that year, right?"
1800.54,1802.78, I mean did I think it did from EGM
1803.18,1810.54, Says so on the box from one up to yep controlling that with the was the scheme must be worse than a console because it's totally digital
1810.54,1811.82, You even have this
1811.82,1813.82, benefit as like slight analogness
1813.82,1818.06, You can take that shit back to how I how I learned to use a mouse and keyboard
1818.38,1823.42, Which was on the dreamcast playing quake and I first bought the mouse so I'd have the the D pad
1824.3,1829.5, An analog stick in the controller in my left hand in the mouse in my right hand and I'd use the two
1829.5,1833.5, That's some savanchid right now and I went and when I moved over to computer
1833.74,1837.26, I got a controller so I could do the same thing because I was like God
1837.26,1840.3, I don't know how I'm gonna do because I still hunt peck type at the time
1840.3,1846.06, I like was absolutely useless on it and so I did that for a while until eventually I hit a game that wouldn't let me do that
1846.14,1849.5, And then that's when I like force myself to get the left hand on the keyboard
1849.98,1851.98, So what was the game I converted you?
1852.06,1854.06, I think it's team forchers that I
1854.38,1856.38, think makes sense
1856.38,1858.38, So I guess like you what I'm saying is
1859.58,1864.46, If you're if you for some reason haven't played rets in a people four yet on any of the platforms
1864.46,1867.74, So it's on game two ps2 and we know right
1869.5,1874.06, And you're a PC gamer and you're just wondering what the fuss was how long ago that was two years ago
1874.06,1877.58," Yeah, it's still I think it was still hold up. I don't know. Yeah, I got all like"
1877.58,1883.8999999999999, But I don't play it on the console don't play the speedy version because if you got a controller
1883.8999999999999,1888.1799999999998, Or it looks better it looked better on your monitor than I've seen for we or game keyboard
1888.1799999999998,1890.86," Right, yes, too. Okay, if you have a gun in 360 controller"
1890.86,1895.8999999999999, Why do you have a 360 controller if you have I guess any decent gamepad controller then maybe so
1896.06,1898.86, But the question is who who is that person that hasn't played it yet?
1899.82,1904.78," Right, maybe there's quite a few I don't know but but I would say I recommend if all you have to keep on in mouse"
1904.78,1907.82, Don't bother especially because that mouse that isn't getting used
1909.34,1913.02, That mouse is gonna be sitting there all lonely. You know I haven't seen I haven't seen it on your computer
1913.02,1918.18," But is it look markedly different from the other versions or it looks pretty sharp. Yeah, I would check it"
1918.18,1920.18, It looks like good
1920.18,1925.26, Except that the cutscenes are like the old you know TV quality
1927.26,1929.26," Also, what's with the way that got looks?"
1929.26,1932.46, Can I just say he's got this voice kind of like this?
1932.54,1935.66, I'm gonna kill some zombies then you look at the guy and he's like this like
1937.5,1943.3600000000001, See look in the guy he's got this like poofy hair and these sort of like game was main Japan girly lips
1943.7,1946.3400000000001, Just like I don't know it's got to be super Metro
1946.98,1953.06," Yeah, he didn't look like the toughest guy like in a Japanese game would always be able to like go to you know"
1953.06,1957.3," To a gay club here and not stand out or stand out as being attracted, you know"
1957.9,1959.26," Right, I mean there's nothing"
1959.26,1963.64," It's all looking worried like oh, it's Sean troubles Sean about the kid who's not"
1963.64,1966.94, That's the thing I mean no like like even like devil may cry the guy Dante
1967.54,1971.34, You know like if you're the he's not heterosexual badass in the way that like
1972.1,1975.9, The pizza face dudes on Giaza war are right you're right
1976.42,1981.5, He's like he's like he's a guy that the wrongs materials right this guy this guy is very
1981.5,1983.02, Affeminate you know he
1983.02,1984.02, You know
1984.02,1987.9, I don't know I'm a masculine but he's like it is very he's like swad
1987.9,1993.7," It's a different culture. Yeah, he's like he swath he's very fiddle fantasy. Do you want you're watching anger?"
1993.7,1998.26, I mean he clips his toenails and he plugs the hair off of his toe right on the end one of those
1998.26,2002.26," Pockmark gears a war guys with the with the barrel chest, but you know"
2002.9,2006.02," Well, maybe I do that enough. This is a whole other topic really"
2007.5400000000002,2009.5400000000002, Are you a fan of bears?
2009.5400000000002,2011.5400000000002, Let's move on all right
2012.18,2016.8200000000002," What else we got anything a little bit a world of conflict, but if you want to hear me talk to work"
2017.06,2019.78, Sean Sean the lie about there's your answer. Oh
2020.02,2023.1," Yeah, that's what we want to hear now welcome welcome back to one"
2023.1,2027.9399999999998," I'll leave you those playing some halo to the depot you wear yeah, that's a go back to PC gaming"
2028.34,2033.7," But yeah, it sounds like my experience with at least a lot smoother than your shadow one one"
2034.02,2038.3799999999999, Because I went to a quick match like on one and like three seconds and they're like cool
2038.3799999999999,2041.02, Said there are 42 games going online. That's pretty healthy for it
2041.6599999999999,2045.26, Just PC also this is just PC players. Yep. Yeah
2045.26,2051.42," There's no mess. I was playing with this one. Well, at least it's good to see the live service up and running when I was playing it was just like a freaking mess"
2051.82,2059.8," Yeah, and I like I said I play like three matches, so I'm not sure maybe I go back after this and it'll be a big mess after the only weird thing that was going on was"
2061.54,2066.82, It took me a while to realize that these were people talking but all I heard whenever I because in that game when you get near someone
2066.82,2071.38, You can kind of hear if you're talking into the mic you can hear them like the ambient sounds that all I heard was
2071.38,2073.38, Oh
2074.58,2077.2200000000003," Actually, I was saying yeah, I"
2077.94,2083.3, Took me like talking in tongues to you took me like 10 minutes to go is that people on their mics trying to talk?
2083.78,2087.2400000000002, That's all I heard I didn't have a mic. I was one of the like bad. She's like in a
2087.94,2089.94, Override mode about to explode
2092.94,2098.7400000000002," Did you try talking back? No, I didn't have a mic and I don't know maybe it wasn't maybe it was a strange sound effect"
2098.74,2102.1, I don't know what it was actually there is a mic on that heads up stairs. Is there yeah?
2102.1,2107.5," Oh, I didn't see it. This is a good time. I don't like talking to ask them to beg listeners if you got this done"
2107.5,2113.1, X-Fi and you found some way or you have some solution to help me get my fucking T-S-V working
2113.8199999999997,2118.54," Actually, I will but the obvious thing would be this to disable it and go to the other"
2118.54,2122.06," The other tech but for some reason, it's not registering that there is on board. Well, that's good"
2122.06,2126.3799999999997, I was having a problem with that computer with that a while ago
2126.38,2129.9," I don't know what I thought I fixed it, but obviously not I will contact guys"
2129.9,2134.96," It creative and we'll get that thing liked. Yeah, yeah, so when the show when you were playing it was"
2134.96,2137.4, Interesting at least on one of those things because I was like
2137.9,2142.38, Backseat playing and they had to get on and actually I begged to play Halo 2 this time
2143.54,2148.7000000000003, But they had it said so that there were no over shields and then you spawned with the battle rifle
2148.7000000000003,2154.1, Which was interesting because that basically speed movement speed aside makes the game very PC like you know
2154.5,2155.5, Where it was like
2155.86,2159.06, You know because with the over shields and everything and when you play Halo 2
2159.86,2165.42, Unless someone has like an excellent combo like a plasma pistol on the regular pistol or something where they kill you really quickly
2165.42,2168.94, Strip you kill you you have the chance to turn around and see who's shooting you
2168.94,2171.7, This was crazy because it was like they could take you down so fast
2171.7,2175.14, You would have the time to turn around and so it would be going down in like a split second
2175.14,2180.46, Which you don't get those little like arrows that some game give you like being shot from the left because there's a big red
2180.46,2184.58," Oh, yeah, the screen this is just like whole screen flashes red and then you're dead"
2185.3,2192.7," So I think that was kind of fun. Yeah, I didn't I didn't particularly find that I just I was just turning from laying to like map what I knew of the"
2193.14,2194.82, Console game to the PC
2194.82,2196.82," Okay, how does this working in front of my doing well?"
2196.82,2199.66, How does this wire all these people doing uppercuts with their sword?
2200.94,2203.1, What about the uh the spawn system?
2204.1,2206.1," Oh, there's that one map"
2206.3399999999997,2209.98," Yeah, was that one the new maps no, there was the one that you unlock"
2210.58,2213.14, And Halo two by beating the campaign
2213.98,2218.86," Okay, I'm what it's called. Yeah, it's like it's like a little map yeah for little beige rooms"
2219.86,2223.74, With with with great and the in multiple people spawn at the same time
2223.74,2230.06," Yeah, everyone spawns in the walk for the door you're fucked because you're getting it by if you you know by the time that you got halfway to the exit"
2230.06,2235.58," Someone will spawn behind you and we'll be shooting you. Yeah, but then if you turn around and prepare to face them and they will spawn"
2236.1,2240.48, You could be fucked because someone could come to the door from behind you. It was comedic. It's like yeah over and over again
2240.48,2245.6, I'd be like chat and I'll tell them what I can keep watching this sit here and throw grenades over here because people are gonna spawn
2245.6,2247.6, There enough someone spawns in
2249.06,2251.06," Right, that's a good idea"
2251.06,2256.74," Shooters, I mean fear right player was so bad when when that was released at the point when I reviewed it"
2256.74,2261.98, It was just ridiculous and that I would just basically sit there on full lot of shooting and letting the body pile up
2261.98,2264.64, It that goes all the way back to the first I mean
2264.64,2269.92," Which I mean that can make one we fuck its spawn problems. Yeah, I know way back in quick one"
2269.92,2273.2, We would you know be sitting there with our shotguns aimed at the spawn point
2275.68,2277.68," Hi, bye"
2278.2,2285.1," Yep, yeah play a little I think the first level of campaign to it was really easy. I don't know if it gets harder"
2285.1,2288.3599999999997, I played it on the Xbox so maybe that part of one
2288.36,2293.1200000000003," Oh, you're just that damn good. Well, I think it's just like it's easy at the beginning too"
2293.1200000000003,2296.88, It's easy at the beginning. I think like with the mouse and QR
2296.88,2300.84," You just have no problem hitting these big muppity things just like oh, here's some work"
2300.84,2304.04, But they do still have like just the enormous crosshairs
2304.48,2309.6," Yes, like for the submachine guns and crap like they're still just giant quarter sized things on there"
2309.6,2313.52," Yeah, they are like so you have kind of like you know your zone of shooting rather than"
2314.04,2316.6800000000003," Yeah, pixel of shooting so that's probably another part of why it's"
2316.9199999999996,2320.48, Seems so easy. I don't know there's level one so I can't really but at my
2320.48,2324.3599999999997, It doesn't it doesn't seem to be a shit block because we got a post on our blog forum
2324.3599999999997,2327.64, There's that picture of any you guys seen it like we're so I did the diagram of
2328.3199999999997,2332.3199999999997, Shadowrunner from the console players point of view in Shadowrunner from the PC players point of view
2332.3199999999997,2336.98, And there's a console player with like a cone a fire coming out
2336.98,2341.3199999999997, So I'm immediately like spreading out so that it's probably about 10 feet high by the time
2341.32,2345.8, Five feet away from them and then he's like got someone he's got a PC player standing in there
2345.8,2349.0800000000004," And he's like screaming like headshot headshot, you know, I don't know"
2352.48,2357.82, That's a good diagram. You should pop that up on the you give them your radio blog. Yeah. That was a funny picture
2357.82,2359.82," Okay, yeah, we'll put it up there"
2360.34,2363.34," Or will we yeah, no, what's your say how good you are"
2363.34,2365.34, The
2366.54,2368.54, Pet shot
2368.54,2374.42, It doesn't seem like they changed a whole lot of the campaign to compensate for the pinpoint accuracy of the Nelson keyboard
2376.54,2381.42," There's like a set of ridiculous difficulty mode. Yeah, I haven't tried it under ridiculous"
2381.42,2383.06," Yeah, whatever. I don't know what they call it"
2383.06,2391.54," Yeah, they don't like yeah, I'm played it. Let's see played on legendary. Oh, yeah, I'm just a play on legendary. Yeah, with Dinger kill once"
2391.54,2393.54, You're an unloved jury
2396.02,2399.14," All right, where are we? All right, everybody else"
2400.1,2403.86," Ryan, we know you bottle up at the city of balance I have"
2404.82,2407.34, How are you gonna get you to pull off that visibility cloak?
2408.42,2409.7799999999997, I don't know
2409.7799999999997,2415.36," Talks to the villains. No, no, I'm talking to the best of you those last two weeks. Nobody wants to hear about that"
2415.7799999999997,2417.7799999999997, You're right. You're a good point
2418.1000000000004,2422.98," We take one of them break it. Yeah, we'll take a what? You okay world the conflict no one"
2422.98,2423.94," Oh, that's right"
2423.94,2427.6200000000003," We're busy on the on the games that are born on console. Okay, right"
2427.6200000000003,2432.02, I'm just talking about a PC based game. It's entirely unique. You're right
2433.0600000000004,2435.0600000000004, It does look like a PC only
2435.0600000000004,2437.0600000000004, Ryan give me that fucking cloak
2437.0600000000004,2439.0600000000004, I don't know we want to hear
2439.0600000000004,2444.1000000000004, So first a PC on the RTS from Sierra right
2444.3399999999997,2447.54," We're a few of us are on the no, actually they've got Sierra"
2448.1,2450.42, And I think you should cut with a
2451.7,2454.9, Thinner slice called like an RTT or whatever like real-time tactics
2455.62,2457.62," Yeah, all right resources"
2458.18,2465.14, I mean you have basically an allotment of points that that tick down and say you know you can get more of them by having some of your units destroyed or whatever
2465.46,2467.46, But you have a finite amount of
2468.02,2470.8199999999997, Points that you can spend or invest how you choose
2471.06,2475.94, Who's the developer for the master of entertainment if guys you need ground control
2475.94,2479.06, Where is right another Eastern European group right
2481.06,2483.06," Sweden Sweden Sweden okay, so it's no"
2484.34,2490.34, The base premise is like late 80s but a Soviet invasion of North America
2490.82,2493.46," So fun red on stuff, you know, but"
2494.5,2499.3, You know when you play you play it's like 16 people online and it works in the way that they kind of want it
2499.6200000000003,2503.7000000000003, It's not a hybrid of an FES and an RTS like literally
2504.02,2508.5, But in some loose terms it is and that the game is so keep going and you can leave and join as it's going
2508.5,2510.1000000000004, You don't have to sit there and wait
2510.1000000000004,2514.1000000000004, You know sometimes it's really hard to get a match like you want to play an eight player company here
2514.1000000000004,2517.3, Those games if you could be sitting there for like you know 30 minutes or something while
2517.7000000000003,2521.7000000000003, The right people come in and then look at your stats and then decide that I don't want to play you and stuff
2521.94,2525.38, So you can just jump in and just basically you can play infantry
2525.94,2527.78, Ground I mean infantry you know
2527.78,2530.6600000000003, I forget it is like an armor roll that's basically tanks and stuff
2531.54,2534.98, Support which would be artillery and to aircraft platforms and such
2535.46,2538.1, repair vehicles or air force
2538.5,2545.3, You basically specialize those you can still draw on units from the other pools if you want but I'm thinking it in the best scenarios
2545.3,2547.3, You have teams where people are
2548.1800000000003,2552.1, Taking on those different roles and then combining arms for protecting working together
2553.06,2557.94, But I have wait a minute so you're actually playing as a character no you have a collection
2557.94,2560.3399999999997, It's a role as a general say it's a safer example
2560.3399999999997,2565.7, You're in charge of the air force or something and you can create attack helicopters or you know heavy
2566.2599999999998,2572.3399999999997, heavy assault choppers and all this you know stuff like that or scout helicopters that basically do the same
2572.3399999999997,2576.8199999999997, Of you know pierce the fire go warped stuff and you have a call of tanks going in but you know
2577.38,2583.6200000000003, They might be vulnerable to you know artillery you know that that's deeper back in the trees so he's like hey
2583.6200000000003,2588.5, Send your scout out forward find there there artillery S yet coming in. I'm gonna go in there with my you know
2588.98,2592.98, Air to ground missiles and you know blast them then
2593.46,2601.38, Because I'm gonna be vulnerable to AA I'm gonna want you to send a couple tanks for a two to fight the AA and then you start mixing it up like the best
2601.38,2606.34, Combinations like I think if you're not cooperating it's kind of still did in that you're like okay
2606.9,2613.2200000000003, I'm a bunch of you know covers or something and I run up against AA that's bad for me or I run up against a bunch
2613.7000000000003,2616.5, A bunch against a tank it's great for me. I get to blast them all the hell
2616.5,2620.5, But if you're if you're mixing your unit types up well with your team and saying like okay
2620.5,2624.42, We want to go capture this point. We want to go capture like city hall or something
2625.38,2631.3, And we're gonna like combine these units and the infantry you can get some buildings and stuff and and it seems like they do some cool
2631.38,2634.1, Things one one concern and a long of those lines is that
2635.62,2640.02, Because infantry because tanks and support vehicles can capture points
2640.58,2643.78, It seems to me to make the infantry less like valuable
2644.34,2647.1400000000003, I mean I looked at the forum as people think it's balanced perfectly
2647.1400000000003,2651.86, But I was just getting I mean just from playing for a couple days guessing that like we're wondering what would happen
2651.86,2654.9, If I'm in the infantry could cap because that way everyone if you're like all right
2654.9,2657.86, I'm gonna be air force. I don't have to just worry about going to get points for myself
2657.86,2660.26, I have to go and actually support my infantry
2660.5800000000004,2662.5800000000004, Are they're gonna get like destroyed?
2663.46,2666.9, But so I haven't played enough to get to get to critical of it
2666.9,2671.1400000000003, But it's just a lot of I mean and it's also a multiplayer on the right you're jet right
2671.1400000000003,2674.1800000000003, In your general experience when you go in a game always says so much
2674.1800000000003,2678.98, You know you're playing it for an hour and you're like am I thinking about how this frustrating a sucks or this is cool
2678.98,2682.5," I want to learn more and it's like it's just totally it's so far my. Hey, this is cool"
2682.5,2686.0200000000004, I haven't played anything like this. I want to learn more it looks great
2686.2599999999998,2692.98, I mean you can zoom down to like FPS like scale and everything still looks fantastic moving through the grass
2693.38,2696.74, The special effects you know that you call it in like an eight ten which is a
2697.54,2699.14, An air to ground attack lane
2699.14,2703.86, You know and it will just rip through with its gatling gun and you know to I mean it just looks so red flying through
2703.86,2705.86," Terren, you know knocking tanks over and stuff"
2706.1,2711.86, You have nukes that you can use as support which is crazy some spiteful asshole dropped a like a technical nuke
2711.94,2716.58, Just on I had three like repair vehicles cap in a point and he was like well that's worth it
2716.58,2718.58, That's worth the damage
2719.2200000000003,2720.82, But
2720.82,2725.06, Some even with the system I got which has got an 8800 GTS hard a
2725.78,2729.6200000000003, Whole lot of you know like the best dual core chip right you know
2729.6200000000003,2735.6200000000003, It's got a decent set of it's not screaming but right but but it's it would chug at times especially during
2736.26,2740.1800000000003, heavy heavy off map artillery rogers and the special stuff like nukes
2740.2599999999998,2745.22," But it's a beta so it's a beta yeah, might not be I might see it. Yeah, that's it that's that"
2745.22,2748.8199999999997, You know just talking about it makes me want you know hopefully next week I'll have a lot more detailed now
2748.8199999999997,2750.8199999999997, So that you've been talking about it makes me want to go
2752.02,2754.02," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
2754.02,2756.02, From from what I'm hearing like on the tech to our side
2756.02,2762.1, I'm gonna think of turning that one into a DX 10 game as well so there's another game actually you know to look forward to seeing what they can do with it
2762.58,2765.94, Maybe we'll let it push mr. I don't know and that I mean that's cool
2765.94,2770.82," I mean just plain is like it this is definitely a peace game and it's it's it's it's just unique, you know"
2772.82,2776.9, Well those guys have got a great track record night anything they do I pretty much like I'm gonna play yeah
2778.26,2779.62, Matter of fact actually if you go online
2779.62,2783.78, I think they still have the like the first two games or the first game that they've ever made ground control
2783.78,2789.06, You can play I think you look at a lot you can find five games for free really well there was a long period of time up on
2789.06,2794.26," I think was file plan that they offered the first game wow, so I don't know if that deal still going but those were good games"
2794.26,2797.7000000000003," If you look from it's out there. Yeah, they were good underrated or definitely underrated"
2797.7000000000003,2802.96," We can't get score. No, we game good scores underrated not the right word. They were just overlooked overloaf. Yes"
2802.96,2804.96, There we go little little darling's
2805.86,2811.46, I think that came at a time when RTS is where either I was actually probably post glott
2812.3,2818.6400000000003," You know, I think it was already we'd already kind of burned out on the genre and those came around. It was definitely winding down. That's for sure"
2820.78,2822.78," Okay, so"
2824.26,2829.3, Break we'll be back with more GFW radio after these words from our sponsors
2830.5600000000004,2831.36, Day

2874.5400000000004,2875.5400000000004, So we've got a
2875.5400000000004,2879.3, In a little bit here. Those are the web we've got we've got a
2879.86,2882.6600000000003, Geek hierarchy that one of you somebody printed that here
2883.1400000000003,2887.5," Well, it's not we've talked a lot about geek them here on this blood guest version"
2887.94,2893.2400000000002, So we found the perfect thing like basically this is all this is better
2893.2400000000002,2898.46," So where was this front? Yeah, it's been floating around for a while this comes from branching dot com oh"
2898.46,2901.26," Oh branching shuttlecock. Yeah, geek chart big"
2901.5,2903.5, That gift
2905.1800000000003,2907.1800000000003, Brunching shuttlecox
2907.1800000000003,2910.82," Yeah, so anyway, they've got this geek hierarchy. It's basically this chart of"
2912.9,2917.6000000000004, Various like species of geek so this is ideal for us. It's basically like everything that we
2918.34,2922.6600000000003, Already and always talk about on this show but like in a perfect chart form for what's weird?
2922.6600000000003,2926.1800000000003," This up on our blog as well. Yeah, we told this shit when I was looking this over"
2926.18,2932.08, You know because it looks like an org chart with boxes and lines like Ryan is actually in most of those boxes
2936.94,2938.94, We were a lot of them
2938.94,2940.94, So am I we're all
2940.94,2942.7799999999997," Yeah, we're all in multiple"
2943.98,2947.58, We also move each each one of us fit that one path of nerd
2947.94,2952.22," That we should not need those for you shit. Right. Yeah, we should do a contest among ourselves"
2952.22,2958.3199999999997, And then list like where we are for the real listeners like you know like we'll call it like you know Jeff boxes and blue and whatever
2958.3199999999997,2967.02," Right yellow. So okay, basically how this works is at the top of the diagram or those who consider themselves"
2967.02,2972.64, Less geeky than those that appear in the diagram below them in cases where they appear parallel to one another
2972.74,2981.3199999999997, You have circumstances where maybe both of them insist that they're less geeky than the other advice versus and those are interesting little moments in the chart
2981.32,2988.4," So okay, we don't have to read every column, but some of them are definitely like worth looking at what's at the very top the last very top"
2988.6400000000003,2995.84, We have you published science fiction or your A published science fiction or fantasy author and our artist
2996.6800000000003,3004.32," Okay, I'm being the key word right being the key word. Okay, and then below that you could be a science fiction fan and fantasy literature fan"
3004.32,3007.36," Okay, those are just the two top and then it branches out into"
3008.2000000000003,3015.1800000000003, Like you know eight various forms and on the far column we have people who majored in folklore and mythology
3015.8,3022.52, Like pretty respectable and then you can sort of like they will condescend to rent fair folk and then with the
3022.76,3028.08," SCA folk. I don't know the SIA Society of Korean and acronyms. Okay. Yeah, and then"
3028.52,3032.26, And both don't look at me like I was in it. I just happened to know what is the other year
3032.26,3037.1400000000003, So both of those will condescend you people who buy expensive replicas of fictional fantasy swords
3038.34,3041.6600000000003, And I looked at them. I've never actually paid and then at the bottom of the
3041.6600000000003,3048.1000000000004, I've wielded one move over and you have comic book fans and these are parallel to people who I don't know
3048.1000000000004,3052.26," Yeah, so comic book fan is about the same as so new major to folklore or mid"
3052.98,3056.82, And they're superior to a comic book fan who reads only superhero comics
3057.06,3061.5," Which is funny because like I was like actually last week distinguishing that oh, I don't read"
3061.6200000000003,3064.7400000000002," You know, but just not super here"
3065.7400000000002,3071.82, So I'm busted below that is actually who I am which is comic book fan who reads superhero comics
3071.82,3077.3, But that just doesn't mean exclusively below that our comic book fans who only read superhero comics
3077.3,3081.36, So they're geeky to you there geeky and it right there are more level to that though
3081.36,3082.86, So again the
3082.86,3090.5, Way what folk or major can condescend to me and I could condescend to Ryan what's the bottom level comic one below that our comic book fans who only read
3090.6200000000003,3092.6200000000003, Exman's been off
3093.34,3096.94," I love that one. Yeah, so the superhero guys were looking down on those guys"
3098.1400000000003,3103.7000000000003, So and that is true because look right I'm condescended to you for only being it's like super here
3103.7000000000003,3107.2200000000003," It's right and you've condescended like oh, yeah, great another"
3107.2200000000003,3108.2200000000003, Exman book or
3108.22,3111.2999999999997," Yeah, I've heard you say that yeah"
3112.2999999999997,3117.68, So wait a minute if go back in that list the fantasy sword guys are like above the comic book guys
3117.68,3120.1," No, no, they're going down"
3120.1,3126.2999999999997," Okay, okay, so basically he's got a really across so basically. Yeah, you have to go to the website because I was gonna just think that"
3127.2999999999997,3132.7999999999997, By expensive replicas are our parallel to people who only read Exman spin offs and both of those
3132.9399999999996,3136.4199999999996, We'll condescend to one another insisting that it's the other that's okay
3136.42,3143.62," The right anyways truly inferior. Yeah, so then we have anime fans who insist on subtitles and this chart places"
3143.98,3146.3, Parallel with anime fans who don't care about subtitles
3147.06,3152.78, Very equal anime fans are pretty much like below both of these you have anime fans who use the term Japan animation
3154.1800000000003,3158.3, And then this one's weird then then below that is Pokemon fans over the age of six
3158.3,3165.5800000000004, I found that one hurts person
3167.02,3173.1000000000004, How far down the list is 10 tie so that that's mess neither of you can clown on like the Japan animation guys
3173.42,3176.5800000000004, Well according to that list see I would argue with my current person
3176.5800000000004,3182.6600000000003, I would put the anime guys below me as a Pokemon fan so moving over yet another call me a video games
3182.82,3185.82, So we're pretty fine. Obviously. Okay video gamers
3186.78,3191.3, Role playing gamers are below us a live-action role playing gamers are below them
3191.6200000000003,3194.86," Okay, 13 year old gamers of any set are below"
3196.6200000000003,3200.54," So again age is like the old the lowest you know, wow, I don't know about that either"
3201.1000000000004,3205.1400000000003, I want to use a little revision on that one then me now not to knock myself a one
3205.1400000000003,3208.98, You want to put like 40 plus gamers below like the under 13 gamers
3209.5,3213.46, I don't right because that's like a natural thing to be 13 and the clearly
3213.46,3215.98, This is bias this was written by a 40 plus first
3219.58,3221.58, This is gospel
3222.86,3227.82, The further you get to top of that chart the non nerd style is the guy who wrote the guy who authored it
3228.46,3236.06," Okay, so given that these are parallel columns here where do live-action role players fit like in the next two like the comic book"
3236.38,3239.1, Comic they are absolutely super hero comic books
3239.7400000000002,3241.42, That's a bad right that sounds about right
3243.46,3247.26, Starts to get fun now we start to move into true freedom one more click over
3248.38,3252.9, Where we have amateur sci-fi and fantasy writers of course those are below the published ones
3254.5,3256.5, Who stand above fanfic writers?
3257.9,3262.58," Then they stand above erotic fanfits writer. Oh, I knew it. Okay. Yeah"
3263.38,3269.7400000000002, However erotic fanfic writers and fanfic writers who put themselves into their own stories both
3269.74,3273.74, And parallel insisting that each is less nerd than they did that
3275.74,3279.54," Yeah, however, I really need this chart in front of me. I don't really appreciate both their"
3279.54,3285.54, Rotic fanfic writers and fanfic writers who put themselves in their own stories insist that they are superior to a
3285.54,3287.74, Rotic fanfic writers who put themselves in their own
3289.18,3293.66, So they're like having sex with Captain Kirk or so right. I kind of think okay. This is yeah
3293.66,3295.94, Ultimately there there though if this is like the
3297.22,3300.8199999999997, Diagram of like Dante's a furnace or something we got farther down to go
3305.18,3307.66," We're still moving through the concentric race, you know"
3309.8599999999997,3313.7799999999997, This one is great because I somehow the fact also that we know about all this shit
3314.14,3319.2599999999998," Wow, that proves that we belong on the list right. Okay, so amateur sci-fi fantasy artists"
3319.26,3325.3, This is opposed to writers. Okay. Okay. Our superior to amateur sci-fi fantasy artists who can't get breast right
3328.82,3332.42," And that's pretty common. I yeah, usually they're however"
3332.94,3335.42, The sci-fi artist who can't draw
3336.0600000000004,3337.1000000000004, boobies
3337.1000000000004,3343.1400000000003," Yes, superior to people who alter scans of sexy and important models to make them look like super hair wins"
3343.14,3351.02, We could have covered on this very podcast now that is red because why don't if we talk about but like I was sending the links around
3351.02,3357.74," Oh, yeah, no, no, yeah, we know what is that site? Oh, God, I totally forgot. Oh, are they had like hot hot super hair"
3357.74,3365.22," Well, they have some stories with four gins or it's sometimes they're in completely inappropriate poses because they're basically photoshopping their sex partners out of it"
3367.7799999999997,3371.7799999999997, But they've got a green lantern at fairs and photoshopping yeah
3371.78,3376.34, Like like a catwoman suit on them. So you like why are legs like that?
3376.86,3379.38," No, why should you in that?"
3379.94,3387.1000000000004," Like who is there a flash doing that? Yeah, so but there's like that sights out there in between suck and stuff like that"
3388.7000000000003,3393.76," Okay, of course science fiction television fans are their own breed at a total respectable enough"
3393.76,3396.86," It's up there with video gamers. Okay, our better than trekkies"
3396.86,3401.44, Thank you cool cuz you're like with that all I watch battle star galaxka sure
3401.44,3407.58," Yep, I look like I look on trekkies and I like battle star so right I'm with that one. Okay, but trekkies"
3407.9,3413.3, We'll condescend the trekkies who speak cling on and trekkies who speak cling on
3414.1800000000003,3418.84," Stand above trekkies who get married and cling on garb. Oh, oh, yeah now"
3420.1400000000003,3422.1400000000003, All of these people
3423.34,3425.34, Our superior to furies
3426.86,3428.86, You mean everybody we've met everyone
3428.86,3430.86, So far I've converged to furies
3432.86,3440.3, Everyone is that's the furry is not the bottom of the dunk hill because the rotik furies are a step beneath the furry
3440.86,3443.58," Okay, oh, we're going from those people"
3445.58,3447.58, The depth of the gravity and geek them
3448.2200000000003,3451.34, It's a very like rock bottom of the geek hierarchy
3451.82,3455.32, Fathories are people who write erotic versions of star trekk
3455.32,3460.96, Where all characters are furies like Kirk is an oselot or something and they put a furry version of themselves
3465.7000000000003,3469.6000000000004," Oh, man so basically when we did our sonic passion, you know"
3470.0,3474.88," Yeah, it was of the web we basically it wasn't star trekk but it was sonic it was basically the same thing"
3474.88,3478.1200000000003, It was a right furies. They put themselves into their own direction
3478.12,3481.92, I mean basically by saying you've married knuckles you basically put yourself in action
3483.92,3490.3399999999997, And we still pissed people off. So that's the geek hierarchy and it was that was that was
3490.3399999999997,3492.3399999999997, We're better off for having having
3493.3399999999997,3495.3399999999997, handy reference in the future
3495.3399999999997,3497.3399999999997, That's like a field guide for e3
3497.3399999999997,3505.62, Or the one up office or whenever yeah in the one up office whenever there's an argument you just like break out the chart
3505.62,3508.44, The hierarchy and see if you're subordinate shut the fuck up
3509.72,3511.72," Yeah, argument over"
3511.72,3517.1," We could probably go through the office and place everybody there. Oh, we're all on there on there everybody totally"
3517.2599999999998,3522.48, What we don't know how to deal with those when we're in multiple columns and we're in the lower positions
3522.48,3526.92," Maybe it's like you're no better than your lowest position in the hierarchy. Oh, God. I'm screwed them"
3526.92,3532.2599999999998," They don't have video game writers on there either. Yeah, we were probably pretty sure you got to be subsets"
3532.2599999999998,3535.16, You'd have to like we got to be about furry so don't you think
3535.62,3538.44," Yeah, oh, I'm pointing to that almost anything is"
3540.0,3544.2799999999997, Of course if we wrote in our furry outfits that would be that right then we'd be low
3545.58,3547.58, Not that we do that
3547.58,3549.58, Speak for yourself on the weekends
3550.08,3551.58," You okay, so"
3551.74,3556.88, Here we're here to inform you those are a little educational segment kind of an NPR
3557.9,3559.9, Segment that would be already yes
3559.9,3561.9, Mm-hmm
3565.1800000000003,3567.1800000000003," Wow, wow"
3567.1800000000003,3572.38," So I'm like they collected collecting selective side of no doubt. Okay, so we had a question of the day"
3572.82,3575.58, Which is a new feature we're gonna forget to do next week
3575.82,3582.1800000000003, But we're doing what we're doing it this week and that's what gamer you most looking forward to playing in 2007
3583.38,3588.1600000000003," Okay, this week we really didn't have the largest podcast preparation"
3588.8999999999996,3592.2599999999998, And yet we're already going on like an hour and a half. Well see there you go
3596.2599999999998,3598.2599999999998," Okay, so"
3598.2599999999998,3603.16, We were trying to come with the list beforehand of games that we're we're gonna say was the low hanging fruit not to mention
3603.16,3607.3399999999997, Because if we weren't around the table and we also start craft tour whatever be like yeah great
3607.3399999999997,3611.2599999999998, Thanks for your thanks for your sights for tea's and insight. Yeah
3612.1,3614.1, So
3615.1,3620.2," I'll start off. Okay, because I got to have actually have the most boring one so we'll get me out of the way first"
3621.72,3626.22, The game I'm also looking forward to playing coming up is actually the
3627.5,3630.48, The age of Empire three expansion show
3631.04,3634.7599999999998," I'm sorry to say yeah, public by Microsoft and"
3635.8399999999997,3643.0," Actually, no, there's a reason for that and it's a reason I didn't know until I started reading up on the game on other websites"
3644.24,3645.24, was
3645.24,3646.74, That is being
3646.74,3652.08, Developed by big huge games and I am currently the biggest big huge games. Oh on planet earth
3652.5,3655.0, So I'm proud to say because I've been
3657.06,3658.06, I'm pretending
3658.06,3659.06, Containing and
3659.46,3664.06," Rise of legending. Oh yeah, so on dual platforms. I am"
3665.1,3671.98, I am big huge games. Oh and so they have taken over the development rings for the next either then parts expansion
3671.98,3675.12, Which is a pretty unusual move I think but
3678.98,3684.14, I'm not paying attention you're like you're gonna have the Halo 2 Vista Medi on there's a vehicle called the shadow
3684.14,3686.4, And it looks like the freaking
3686.4,3688.06, Savannah getting to shooter from TV
3690.86,3692.86, Clearly my topic
3696.86,3700.54," Yeah, but it was actually it is kind of cool like again. That is a pretty funny thing"
3700.54,3704.74," It is pretty cool the big huge games guys are doing it like you know Brian Reynolds, you know came from this team"
3704.74,3711.54, I read right right right. I mean just a weird thing that happened here here really was on age of M. Parts one right and now
3713.3,3716.9," Gosh, I don't know I may need to be corrected on that. Maybe we're done too"
3717.62,3720.34, But I guess ensemble. It's probably busy with
3720.9,3726.82, Halo Wars right so they farm this out to big huge games and they have promised lots of gameplay
3727.94,3729.94, Advancements which
3729.94,3732.44, Sound good to me so far and it's got an Asian theme
3733.14,3737.64, Edmund Parsri and you know how much we all love Asia here in geek them so
3738.02,3740.34, Maybe the characters look like anime characters
3741.34,3748.3, What you've had a mission I'm hoping for I'm helping the NPCs all those big bug guys and I'll look like they're 14 in that short skirt
3750.86,3756.9, You watch a lot of anime and tell me you joined Shane Beton house and then garnet on the on the top who trek to
3757.9,3759.9, Chikon town
3762.9,3765.9, Chikon is like Japanese for pervert
3766.9,3774.02," Yeah, I was like a long time ago and then one of yours thing that about the heavy trains there that their mock trains and you go in and group"
3775.02,3780.5," Oh that thing yeah, and Chikon of course is also what you yo if you're being molested public there"
3780.5,3782.7000000000003," No, I love the vendors hand in screenshot"
3783.2999999999997,3786.5, Why not really want to molest people in Asia?
3786.5,3792.2599999999998, I just want to hide the age expansion and there's your style and there's your show and by for the box
3794.7,3801.06," Sounds good sounds cool. I still have an unplayed copy of age three. It's a good game. Yeah, it's a very good game"
3805.06,3811.98, And that's me Ryan what game you most looking forward to playing coming up my game is pirate to the burning sea
3812.7,3818.7, We guess it's an MMO by a new developer called flying lab software
3818.7,3823.2999999999997, I don't know either don't have a publisher yet or there's self publishing. I'm not sure and
3824.7,3830.8999999999996," It looks like a pretty cool game. I mean, it's not your your standard fantasy MMO and kind of bored with those"
3831.7,3835.18," And yeah, I'm gonna be the tenet once we'll do that to you right"
3835.18,3837.18, MMO players are sitting above
3837.18,3839.18, Fantasy MMO player
3839.3799999999997,3842.18," Yeah, exactly in my people to new category"
3842.18,3846.18," Well, there's actually like ship to ship combat on this and like sword play and stuff like that right"
3846.18,3850.4199999999996," So it's an action. There's actually action in here. Well, the way yeah, there's all that stuff"
3850.4199999999996,3854.06," I played a little bit sort play it. Oh, yeah, so it's my sister"
3854.06,3856.06, I would see MMO
3856.06,3861.8199999999997, MMO swordplay see you get the creative pirate that's your deal everybody's a pirate you get to create a pirate of
3863.02,3865.02, I think French Spanish or
3867.2599999999998,3870.54, British origin I think do you get a parrot?
3870.54,3873.58, I think that's that's one of the costume options. Yes
3875.1,3880.46, A speaker is a costume option. I played a little bit of it at a demo a few months back and
3880.74,3884.3399999999997, The costume options and just like the character creation in general looks like it's
3884.7799999999997,3888.58, It's at least on par with city of heroes if not iPad out
3888.98,3891.98, How much range can you have a bag like about a peg leg?
3891.98,3895.58, I'm a peg leg peg legs and hooks and all that crash
3895.98,3900.78, There's something that this is called a little Darren was about to say it what say it
3901.26,3907.14," No, I go you go say what you were going to say no, no, go for it. I was I was about to say that there's like some like"
3907.66,3914.38, Fico territory that is got to be about to like head is you the moment someone says can you be an agent can you get it?
3914.38,3916.38, Ninja costume
3916.38,3920.06," So you weren't tell me you weren't gonna say that no, actually I was not gonna say that okay"
3920.06,3925.1," Nice, yeah, yeah, we all been I was thinking of something else, but no all right cool"
3926.22,3929.2599999999998," Anyway, I just wanted to like I don't want to say that"
3930.2999999999997,3936.38, Except you just so wait so it's only pirates right? There's not like there's no other race no elves or pirates
3936.38,3938.38, I'm so what do you do then?
3939.74,3941.74, I'm ready to pirate
3941.74,3948.62," Well, well, what you can have like I said you can be like French British or Spanish origin whatever I guess it stands in for like race in your"
3948.62,3953.7799999999997, To the plane well or you can answer the magic wheel. There's I don't know probably the French that
3958.58,3962.62, There's I'm sorry there's a fourth race that you can pick which is just
3963.18,3964.62, Pirate ghosts
3964.62,3967.66, Which like is unaligned which is just pirate
3968.7799999999997,3971.74, So British pirate all British pirates finish pirate
3972.74,3974.74, Straight ahead
3974.74,3980.54, Those other countries are the Compton pirate green well if you belong to one of the nations
3980.54,3982.54," Right, you don't you don't have to be like"
3983.02,3984.7, Some kind of evil assholes right?
3984.7,3986.7," It's here basically, okay, right?"
3986.7,3988.7, You're working for you know
3988.7,3990.4199999999996, For sale your freelance
3990.4199999999996,3996.4199999999996," Spaniards or whatever, but I thought all pirates are like pretty land is it kind of like I'm a French pirate I'm not not representing Napoleon"
3996.4199999999996,3998.4199999999996, Is it kind of
3999.7,4003.7799999999997," Is it kind of like the citymires pirates, but MMO is a bit more action-based is that kind of"
4005.2999999999997,4011.06," I guess that might be a good way to describe and yeah, all right, but your character is more of the ship than the person right though"
4011.06,4014.66," Because I know all right, no really he is not there"
4015.22,4017.7799999999997, I mean you can own a ship you can own several different ships
4018.4599999999996,4021.4599999999996, But who's gonna want to be the first mate on a ship as opposed to being the captain?
4021.9399999999996,4023.9399999999996, What is it everybody the captain?
4023.9399999999996,4029.3799999999997, You know what I don't think that other people I don't think you have like a crew of real people
4030.1,4032.8199999999997, But I mean you can have like fleets everybody's got his own good
4032.82,4038.26," Because Darren raises a good point. Oh, you want to be one of the guys rowing like so it's got to be galley galley slave"
4038.9,4041.6200000000003, This game I've been rowing for eight hours
4043.3,4044.98, Is it a cabin boy what the
4046.26,4049.38, If it was constantly told you you get a cheat me for people
4050.82,4053.94, And it was PC and they told you you rank up for doing it
4055.7000000000003,4056.98, You leveled grime
4056.98,4058.98," Sorry, four hours of rowing"
4059.46,4063.38, So right right how was that a macro for that and stuff is that cool was that like its own?
4064.5,4066.9, Or is it just just click on a direction in your boat goes
4068.02,4070.02, Oh the sailing
4070.02,4071.3, I mean it looks
4071.3,4073.3, Manual to me
4073.3,4077.94, Like when you're sailing around you're both there's there's this ring around your boat
4078.58,4086.1, That indicates like the wind direction and wind speed and it's colored so that you know if you're here sailing into like over the red side of the ring
4086.1,4088.26, You're sailing into the wind that's like in real
4088.98,4091.18," Right, yeah when I've gone sailing into you have that color"
4091.18,4093.18, We're going to color rings around that right
4094.02,4096.02, Cool though
4096.02,4098.02, Like okay
4098.02,4104.82," Yeah, that's okay for something that the combat set up to be to take advantage of that turns into ship to ship combat and then boarding scenario"
4104.82,4107.86," That's cool. That's the last one they go through the cave. Look, you know"
4108.1,4114.1, I've got to say this is probably this is mostly ship to ship combat right that seems where the PvP and all that stuff is
4114.42,4121.54, So you could you actually take over someone else's ship say like boarding party is stuff like that you can like and what what have like fun
4121.620000000001,4126.26, The way the game set up there there's three different I think three different classes you've got like
4128.42,4134.660000000001, Whatever just like kind of the warrior class I forget what it's called like private here or whatever and then there's
4135.22,4141.46, There's a merchant class which is just kind of a the craftsman and then there's there's a third one
4141.46,4143.46, It's basically kind of like a robe
4143.54,4144.82, class
4144.82,4147.54, Like you can you know you like sterile from all this other stuff
4148.02,4150.02, But um
4150.02,4156.42, The whole the whole world is in like this kind of perpetual state of war and there's all these different ports all over the map that players
4156.9800000000005,4158.9800000000005, Could get together and like take over
4159.46,4164.82, And even if you're just like a merchant or whatever if you're like shipping goods to a port or like smuggling away from a port
4164.82,4168.5, You're like helping to take over that port so everybody's got their like little rolls
4168.5,4170.9800000000005," Okay, so even if you don't like getting into combat"
4171.459999999999,4175.7, You've still got something you can do to kind of help the big picture so the trick is making sure
4175.7,4181.7, I mean just I guess just like the era so like if you're if you just want to be a merchant and we just have run trade routes
4181.94,4184.9, You have to make sure you have partner up with the private here. So you protect you
4185.379999999999,4187.78, Right and then just make sure you just follow the save zones
4188.339999999999,4194.78," Right, I mean there's gonna be you know different lanes and like where you know other nations"
4194.86,4201.9, They'll be able they can attack you people from other nations can get into like big ship ship ship combat scenarios with you
4202.7,4205.099999999999, And um from what I understand like
4206.38,4212.139999999999, The ship ship combat like you'll be sailing to the ocean that you'll you might be like a ship ship combat going on
4212.139999999999,4218.46, But they'll be like a marker in the ocean which indicate hey there's a ship ship like instant's going on and you can like jump in and help
4218.94,4221.259999999999, People like from your side that are in this combat
4221.42,4228.9400000000005, Know is there more to the combat than just like what direction your cannons are facing and like what your cannon rating is or because like MMOs
4228.9400000000005,4233.1," Probably like in saying it's like a di rolling kind of thing. Well, yeah because like MMOs like"
4233.66,4239.18, They all of what makes some complexes the fact that like you know a tank scout this skill set
4239.18,4243.58, And he's got a bunch of different skills that they're coming on the DPS where it was like these 10 I know there there's some kind of
4244.46,4251.02," Skill tree that kind of vaguely reminded me of wow, but I don't know they kid it like just make stuff up like you have like the skirt"
4251.02,4253.42, Be cannon he strike everyone let's give me for five
4255.1,4258.38, And they're speed so they've got a bit of a sea so hey
4258.860000000001,4263.660000000001, Can we walk new so off the plank that's what I want to know now hope so get your ass off the plank
4265.02,4267.02, Then push
4268.3,4270.3, Take them from the server
4271.26,4276.14, So I'm hoping to get in on the closed beta this game soon
4277.18,4279.18, Sounds good
4281.02,4283.02, Idea to us begging to be in on like
4284.22,4288.9400000000005, Get us it on this beta get us it on that beta. I want to play we promise to talk about your game on the next podcast
4291.9800000000005,4295.820000000001," That sounds pretty cool actually yeah, that's all right Ryan good job"
4296.14,4298.14," Hey, Ryan"
4298.14,4303.26," I know we we covered it in varying degrees, but I'm looking forward to age of Conan. I"
4303.26,4306.700000000001," Yes, so yeah, so now look good when they brought it in yeah"
4307.26,4310.540000000001," When did they last bring it in I mean I oh gosh, well it's been a while now"
4311.1,4316.780000000001," Last time I remember seeing it was around the time of the vista long. I think that's right. Yeah, I think it looks really promising"
4316.780000000001,4322.22," I mean it I mean besides the whole graphical flossing as yeah, it's gonna be using DX 10 and whatever"
4322.540000000001,4327.42, I really like the idea of a game that it's kind of an MMO but it's kind of not I mean like I can go through a single player
4327.42,4330.46, RPG which there aren't quite currently enough of these days and
4331.1,4336.46, It seems to be like it's like an action RPG and then once you level hit level 20 or hit the end game
4336.94,4341.82, Then you can take that hero in online right the X is a single player game right first
4342.06,4345.66," Yeah, which makes a lot of sense to me. It's like you know you have these crappy tutorials"
4345.66,4350.06, You don't give a rat's ass about and then you're stuck with a little crap character out in the world
4350.38,4353.5, I'd rather have all these cool powers and then you just go out and do something as a true hero
4354.14,4357.66, And I guess they're they're drawing pretty heavily from the Conan world
4358.3,4360.78, You know not just the shorts and I can move you
4360.78,4363.1," What yeah, yeah, from what actually it looks pretty damn grim"
4363.9,4364.86, Yeah
4364.94,4370.46, I see I want to I want to get back and read those books. I'm up there still in print or if you got to get him from use books
4370.46,4371.66, There's
4371.66,4373.66," Yeah, original series. You know what I would recommend"
4374.62,4376.62, The current dark horse comic
4377.339999999999,4381.179999999999," Oh, yeah, is very good right they're redoing coming over the first couple of days"
4381.179999999999,4382.7, In doing it I'd
4382.7,4385.74, pass the mid 20s now
4385.74,4389.98," Been doing it for a while. Yeah, there's just a comic bookization of the original models"
4390.62,4395.66," There are some kind of new story threads in there, but mostly there a dad"
4396.299999999999,4401.58," Okay, so not superhero comic. I'll take a look at it. They were for a time written by a curfew"
4401.58,4404.58," Sake oh, yeah, you awesome right cool"
4405.339999999999,4407.339999999999, Good ducks. Do you like Conan?
4407.339999999999,4410.7, So if Darren are you in on the beta for age of Conan?
4411.259999999999,4414.62," I don't think it's actually going up yet. Okay, I've got to get you on that"
4415.0199999999995,4416.78," Yeah, I think we don't get it on that one. Yeah"
4417.58,4419.58, Oh
4419.58,4424.139999999999," I have asked yeah, you know, I have asked and I I am looking for like one second actually talk about it. I will"
4424.78,4427.82, But from what I've seen past couple times looks really cool
4428.38,4433.259999999999, Actually want to throw in since he mentioned that it reminded me other than my boring expansion pick
4434.219999999999,4436.46, Warhammer on mine because the other one I'm looking for too
4437.259999999999,4439.259999999999," I like the warhammer universe, so"
4440.38,4443.58," Yeah, we're because it's got the whole chicken and egg"
4443.58,4446.7," You know, okay, who did it first warcraft or warhammer?"
4446.7,4449.58," Yeah, but only warhammer has the cocky sanding orcs"
4450.14,4453.26, So the soccer who'll again orcs that's exactly exactly yeah
4454.14,4458.3," I mean, that's all I even the you know P.V.P. because that's kind of what the game is like that"
4458.3,4460.7, I'm wrong with you. I am the song that I'm the one doing the killing
4461.42,4463.42," Oh, that can you might have a great time"
4465.18,4467.18, Sean Elliott Europe
4467.42,4469.42, Um
4469.820000000001,4473.02, I don't really have much to say because all the games there's so many games
4473.02,4476.46, I haven't really looking forward to but they're all sure that you like aren't your bandlist
4476.46,4478.46, They're not we didn't say what the bandlises
4479.18,4484.3," I love that I love that yeah, but what I thought was the stuff that we always we haven't really talked"
4484.3,4488.38," You know, I think it would be wrong to say that we always talk about these games because on our podcast"
4488.38,4490.780000000001, We don't well maybe we don't go go part
4491.34,4494.06," I don't know I have to just pick one. It's the toss up, you know, there's like"
4495.02,4497.02, The full trigger man come on
4497.9800000000005,4500.38, Stuff I've seen and played recently
4501.34,4502.620000000001, Crisis
4502.620000000001,4504.620000000001, Great wars
4504.620000000001,4507.34, I've like to come out in one team for it just to
4508.06,4510.06, By ho shock
4510.06,4511.5, Wait a week pick one that is
4511.5,4515.5, Wait a day. That's one hell of a game man. That is like the best fucking game on the planet Alan Wake
4515.5,4521.34," Like all the stuff basically that we had in our life, you know top top 10 of 2007"
4521.34,4524.38, It's quite quite courses kind of slipped off the radar here
4525.1,4529.9800000000005, Because he's been getting pushed back. I guess people just been kind of like we're just waiting at this point
4530.38,4533.9800000000005," Yeah, it's definitely gonna like I mean it needs to come out sooner"
4533.9800000000005,4535.02, You know
4535.02,4537.02, Visually it's not gonna be the
4537.02,4542.06," Quite is amazing. Yeah, I mean didn't we play this like two three two e3s ago"
4542.860000000001,4545.5," Yeah, I think so no we didn't play it two e3s"
4546.06,4548.54, I know the first we've just played it the last e3
4548.54,4550.54, I'm not sure about the one before right
4551.5,4558.62, But it's still it's still great looking game reason I'm looking forward to that and and crisis so much are like I just that's just my you know
4558.62,4563.900000000001, He's a dumb cliche for for lack of a better option right now. This is my bread and butter and like I love to play
4564.78,4568.38, Ideally I'll be playing like a great piece of game like every single night
4569.34,4574.7, And that's just has the potential to be that kind of game and battlefield two is that way at one for me
4574.7,4579.5, And it's kind of I've kind of been like you know just like wandering looking for stuff since
4579.98,4584.7, It took me year and a half before I got tired on that and actually with this new computer the first thing I did
4584.86,4590.06, Got all my boosters again and patch that up was gonna play but my team speed was like making such horrendous noise
4590.06,4593.58, No one would play with me and it's like I only want to play that when I got a group of friends
4594.86,4601.1, But but quick work and stuff has got the potential to be that game where it's like it's just so much to get out of like you know
4601.1,4605.82, Mastering it and you know subtle tactics and the different vehicles and different units
4606.0599999999995,4613.099999999999, Combowing the different you know class attributes and stuff and it and just just the fun of like just playing it over and over again
4613.099999999999,4617.9," Not getting not having and not get old, you know and on the multiplayer front crisis is the same"
4618.46,4622.7, Has the same potential with the vehicle stuff which you know I've only played
4623.259999999999,4627.98, multiplayer without those and that that's I mean that that's fun on its own is like I really you know
4627.98,4629.58, Once you start throwing the vehicles and the
4630.139999999999,4634.219999999999, If they implement the economy system and the power struggle mode in a way that they promised
4634.38,4637.34, Me like some of the examples like we actually did talk about
4637.9800000000005,4643.26," This on the one-up show a few weeks ago, but the edit it out my favorite part is talking about how well for some reason"
4643.740000000001,4644.7, You were saying
4644.7,4648.7, Guess you're not getting the fourth chairman you didn't hear milk his music coming through your office
4648.7,4652.7, So I was joking about like how it's like that's what I call tech. No don't take no for an answer
4652.7,4656.38," I was right, but I was saying how like you and you and him are gonna be"
4656.780000000001,4662.54, Doing the hazard county jumping in a Jeep over bridge but then like I'll hit you with the ice beam and then you'll just like fall straight
4662.7,4667.66, Straight down and not complete the jumping chatter and stuff. But it's all that kind of possibility for just
4668.14,4673.9, You know punching the crap out of people's vehicles and I mean if there's anything like the build-y to wing walk and stuff
4673.9,4679.34, I mean that's it's all that stuff's just so much fun just messing around those engines and seeing what you could do
4679.82,4681.34, You know like
4681.34,4686.06," Again, it turned it back to Halo like everyone's so excited because there's a video from the Halo 3 beta of someone"
4686.54,4688.54, basically
4688.54,4691.0199999999995, launching a vehicle across the map and it lands
4691.9800000000005,4696.9400000000005, In another you know it is a total feet. I'm sure it took a lot of time to do it and it basically lands
4697.5,4704.14," You know hole in another team's base, but it just reminded like there's just so much potential work just insanity and like really really"
4704.46,4706.46, Mind boggling stunts in that kind of game
4707.02,4710.06, And then of course the single player I'm looking for like the great
4710.22,4716.540000000001, Savior for single player shoot not Savior even but like but the next great thing and is that gonna be
4716.62,4721.18, Bioshock so it can be half light you have it so too. It's crisis gonna be it could be all of them
4721.18,4724.3, I know I know I hope it is yeah my money's on bio-shock
4725.58,4727.58," Yeah, I hope so"
4729.98,4736.46, My life good segue to me because I won't say bio-shock because that's kind of I but you could I could no no
4737.5,4741.18, With the I guess we call it low hanging fruit that like sport
4741.5,4745.18, It's a car of course to be great. I'll pick a dark horse candidate
4746.54,4748.54, Looking for two sins of a solar empire
4749.26,4752.86," The darkest the dark horses are really good pick yeah, it's"
4754.38,4758.38, I think they're building it as a real time for extra energy game right
4759.18,4760.46, That's like your
4760.46,4762.46, Galsive to
4762.46,4766.78, I just really like oh a dark horse game I could I had one but never okay. We'll come back
4767.58,4769.9, So that's like a galsive two versus I mean meet
4769.98,4771.5, It's a homeworld yeah
4771.5,4776.54," So it sounds like it could be incredibly overly complicated, but I don't know from"
4777.74,4781.5, What I've heard them say it sounds like they're on the right track to make it not
4781.98,4787.18," Incredibly crazy over complicated right it's being published by Star Dock, but who does it develop it is too"
4787.18,4788.86, But the developer is ironclad
4789.66,4791.66, That's right yeah
4792.46,4794.46, It's the first
4794.46,4798.78, Star Dock game Star Dock is publish it. That's correct. It makes sense and it has a great name
4799.1,4801.18, It does have a great name. It does have a great name. It's a solar empire since like
4801.58,4806.78," Great pulp sci-fi. Yeah, someone who is a science fiction slash fantasy literature fan"
4807.18,4809.18," Yeah, I'm a crew of that name. Yeah"
4810.46,4815.18," But not someone who does fan fiction where they involve themselves well, I mean if this game is good enough"
4815.18,4817.18, I will write stories about
4817.18,4819.18, In this universe with you in it
4820.54,4824.86," Yes, no, I'm all good and also a lot out but private private private here shine below"
4825.339999999999,4831.339999999999, So that was in my awesome lot outfit. There's one column in the geek irg it and read
4831.339999999999,4832.62, That's why I just handed to you know
4832.62,4834.62," Yeah, it's a whole other column here now"
4834.62,4840.46," The right time. We got high line fans in the top there. Okay, uh-huh and beneath that pure Anthony fans"
4844.299999999999,4845.82, Yes
4845.82,4847.099999999999, My life
4847.58,4850.46, People who read books based on science fiction TV shows
4851.42,4853.42, Have I written it?
4854.06,4857.62," No, I think I'm a I found all battle psycho I take a book sick a long"
4857.62,4860.46," Oh, I haven't bought them yeah, they have them"
4860.78,4866.78, But I actually can I look contact I thought I didn't but I didn't take it to the cafe
4866.78,4871.34, That's it to think is it to take it is to commit to sin you already sin to combine you by as well
4871.34,4876.62, Bought it to take it ready. I will admit to having started to read a star Trek the next generation novel
4876.86,4878.86, Oh
4878.86,4880.86," Dude, and let's move on"
4881.58,4886.94, I like her all I just enjoyed the forge removed the banana clip that was spray painted silver from his face
4887.34,4890.0599999999995, They're not a command of his oron novels sitting right here on the same
4890.0599999999995,4895.42," I yes, oh, yes, I do and there's even like bookmark. Oh, I have this thing. I have this thing dog aid for later"
4895.98,4897.98," Yeah, for later. Oh, yeah"
4898.38,4900.7, People underneath that and this is right about phrase
4901.42,4905.98, People who refer to a group of TV TV show based books as quote my collection on a book
4907.26,4912.86, What does that mean? I didn't get that swear or you're only as your only collection as your library
4913.42,4915.42, It's just so
4915.42,4920.38, Right you don't just have like a couple you know start to act an extra action books
4920.38,4922.38, You have the whole collection of it
4922.54,4924.0599999999995," Yeah, you know"
4924.0599999999995,4926.0599999999995, You can see some four of the novels
4928.46,4932.54, I wish you had read that you don't properly understand the TV show unless you read all the books
4932.78,4935.66, You know I was reading there was a threat on quarter to three that was about
4936.3,4942.7," Heroes which is now you know gone for the season, but there were guys arguing that if you're not reading the web comics"
4943.58,4947.66, Every week you're not really watching the show the way you were supposed to
4947.9,4952.62, That's so much said you know like welcome to 2007. This is how we watch our entertainment now
4953.18,4957.5," No, for if you just want to watch part of it will enjoy 1997"
4958.06,4962.06," Like sorry, I'm just committing to the show"
4964.06,4966.06, I did finish
4966.06,4971.02," Season say this say what did you respond with that's with the equivalent in gaming, you know like you"
4971.02,4974.06, You don't play command and conquer until you read the novel there. It's holding that's right
4974.06,4979.18, I'm sorry. I'm not gonna I've actually loaded one or two of those heroes web comics and they're pretty good
4979.98,4982.7," All right, but I'm not gonna make that part of my jeep"
4982.7,4985.5, Is it stills of the actors or is it?
4985.5,4987.9, It's actual an old straight who's the artist?
4987.9,4989.9, Tim sale
4991.5,4995.58, God because I can a second rate I will make that Tim sale is on
4995.58,4997.18, Long alone here we go check the truck
4998.54,5001.9," Where are these two guys on the chart now? Yeah, all right wing over a team of"
5001.9,5003.18, Art books
5004.14,5009.5, The fact that you know who Tim they're so many like classic like you can take any given like one of his drawings and look at the face
5009.5,5015.02," And it looks like just completely mangled messed up. Yeah, but do they all but that's below that's below the breast thing"
5015.02,5020.26, Like can't even draw hook a face that doesn't look like it's down syndrome his art style is very
5023.660000000001,5026.06, Wasn't PC with that's not
5027.42,5028.620000000001," Wow, I"
5028.620000000001,5031.580000000001," Okay, it's not even on the list. I don't know where we're at here now"
5031.9800000000005,5033.9800000000005, Let's go back to Sean
5033.9800000000005,5035.9800000000005, Yeah
5041.26,5044.1," What was your little dark you said you had a dark one yeah, yeah, he done"
5045.1,5048.3, Cut you off. That's fine. I don't even know what I'm gonna say. He's on the back of that game
5052.46,5059.580000000001," No, it escaped me at the moment because of course there are a lot of smaller games that like I am you know anticipating"
5059.580000000001,5062.38," But I like that that really are moving it. It's awkward now, but of course"
5063.580000000001,5068.22, All-ignatics and you know Maddox games is battle of Britain storm or bell. That's coming out
5069.02,5072.14, I've seen it's so funny because they basically move now
5072.3,5077.740000000001, Ubisoft is no longer publishing their their game and they had some weird stuff with promoting
5078.22,5082.700000000001, Which was interesting because when we did we just didn't a magazine. We'll talk we'll talk about it just like very quickly
5082.700000000001,5085.9800000000005, We did we did story in them in the magazine. It was hard because at some point
5087.660000000001,5092.860000000001," So from Ubisoft contact us was like hey, why are you talking to him or something or we hear you gave him"
5092.860000000001,5098.38, He gave you assets for his next game. You can't run those you can't run those. We're not promoting the game at this time
5098.46,5102.06," And I was like oh well, that's fine. I'm not promoting the game. I'm talking about you know"
5102.06,5109.34, We're the writer's talking about this guy this guy's career his life and is general attitude toward the genre of game that he had decided to specialize
5109.900000000001,5111.66, But it was really interesting and all it was like
5112.9400000000005,5116.14, You know what's wondering like it seems like that's not I mean
5116.86,5122.46, How are you promoting the game in general like you did the dude himself gave us some pictures from something he's working on you know
5122.62,5124.62, But anyway long story short whatever the case
5124.94,5133.74, He ends up promoting the game most through some of the staffers that post on something awful forums and show new screenshots and stuff and works in progress and the stuff just looks great
5134.46,5136.46, Not only can you know you trust them to
5137.98,5141.0199999999995, Have you know just the first rate you know combat engine
5142.0599999999995,5148.0599999999995, For you know for their aircraft and stuff but like they're modeling everything down to like in the interior of you know the planes
5148.46,5150.0599999999995, Like I mean every
5150.06,5163.18, Substantial thing from like you know self-sealing field tanks to but but just like you know cables and the wires and the material properties of all the intervening layers and modeling like the damage to each one of those things and then translating that back into
5164.46,5171.740000000001, You know your ability to fly the plane and stuff so before you're like a I got a runner-ruttered like jammed or something in it would model that but now it's like
5172.06,5179.660000000001, It's like modeling I mean they're they're saying it's modeling like the difference of like if you're if you're missing 20 pounds of crab ball one side of the plane or like
5180.139999999999,5184.0599999999995, One very specific cable was cut by a round or something you know
5184.22,5189.68, Which is like super geek like flight flights and stuff and ultimately it translates into you being able I mean
5189.68,5192.38, Flying like piss poor because you got shot or something
5193.66,5197.74," Yeah, even it but it makes it matter if you're dogfighting you can get like two rounds or someone"
5197.74,5202.62, There's a chance that it might mean something that's gonna give you the advantage and the rest of the fight or something
5202.94,5207.26, But you know the ground stuff looks great and it's just like I mean this does guys
5207.26,5211.1, Don't even need to prove himself. It's like basically take I'll too and now just like
5211.66,5217.9800000000005, Focus on the really extreme simulation is a battle of Britain and give us you know and even you know more thorough
5218.46,5220.46, Simulation of it that looks even better. I'm soul
5221.1,5225.9800000000005," Is it magic this time there is magic yeah, yeah, you can do magic"
5226.54,5228.54," Okay, then I'm sold too"
5228.54,5230.54, I need magic that's right you have dragons play
5230.860000000001,5233.820000000001," Yeah, I need this little fireball out the outside window the plane"
5234.780000000001,5236.780000000001, Then I'm in
5236.78,5241.259999999999, Or like you know what was that game was talking about name 1975 you need other engines shoot like
5241.98,5244.94," He'd see fireballs that yeah, or big mushrooms"
5247.34,5248.54, All right
5248.54,5252.42, Is that it? I would do it we need some bonus to be here bonus material bonus
5252.42,5254.86, There was there. It's got the yeah that agreed it's from the
5255.259999999999,5260.139999999999," Modeling the command and conquer book. What are you name of that book, Dan? It's command and conquer type Burya moors"
5260.62,5263.42, By Keith R. A decandito
5263.9800000000005,5267.1," Okay, okay, because he's yeah, that's the show up randomly"
5267.5,5270.78," You know, I showed up randomly like four I got four copies of the book now"
5271.02,5277.9, I'm like wow so is this a novel of the story of the game or is it novelization another world aspect
5278.3,5284.14," Right, I like the point that the cover of the novel. Yep is the same cover that we used on issue two of our man"
5284.14,5288.06," Actually, it's like we commissioned the artist to do this on the naiser for their book"
5288.3,5291.580000000001," Yeah, yeah cool lawsuit coming"
5292.14,5295.38," That's not true. No, no, no, no, no"
5296.580000000001,5301.240000000001," I told them that we'd like an image that along no, I think I thought MJ"
5301.240000000001,5305.9400000000005," They gave us the illustration. Oh, we had a 3D renderer"
5307.22,5310.900000000001, crazy I didn't even know that or something like that anyway
5310.900000000001,5315.22," So that's the illustration that's the illustration. Okay, so all right"
5315.780000000001,5319.02," Look, so wait does it taste like concurrently with the game after the game"
5319.780000000001,5322.58," That would actually assume I read the book oh, but I"
5323.1,5328.06," Come on, I need to know where in the timeline this falls. Well, you know what I can read off a choice"
5328.06,5333.14," Bit but I might need to I might need your guys help on this one. Okay, the sergeant was leading the soldiers in a chance"
5333.14,5336.7," I don't know, but I've been told yeah, okay, never mind wait"
5338.18,5341.3," No, you don't have to I'm gonna spray you"
5342.3,5348.320000000001," Okay, I'll just read it all 19 soldiers are applied in perfect units and I don't know could I have been told?"
5348.62,5352.3, And I'll just fuck I'll just keep going not he's they ain't got no soul
5353.42,5357.58, Ty rock that's what they crave but from us they will not be saved
5359.7,5362.74, So imagine your head you know
5362.74,5367.18, I'd almost prefer a book with like and he draws a box around the screen and
5367.18,5372.22, And hot queue is a tech group one that'd be great
5373.18,5375.740000000001, Book of a guy playing an arcade play by the
5376.38,5380.66, Dude Jeff how many drugs do you smoke do we had that exact same comedy totally dead?
5380.66,5381.66, We totally did
5383.66,5386.780000000001, It was a couple of the way listeners. I have to not really
5390.42,5395.58, So we have the same thing and that's the week penny arcade put out a comic that was more or less the same thing
5395.58,5399.38, Everyone's making the same joke at the same thing that everyone's like that juke so played out
5401.74,5404.34, Let me see are you read are you reading the end?
5408.34,5412.26, Spoiler warning if you're at home and you listen that you're listening to
5412.26,5416.22, And you've got the command and conquer novel and you don't want to know what happens at the end
5416.22,5421.5, You yeah press mute right now because Darren reading the end in the short term he knew that sacrifices will be made
5421.82,5424.98, And all those who followed Kay knew that death was a distinct possibility
5425.18,5431.54, Though he suppose that they all expected to die fighting GDI not they hear here for told unheard of aliens
5431.98,5436.14, They're souls however were in good hands for they had died in the service of not an of
5436.7,5440.14, Tyberium ultimately that was all that mattered to them and to Kayn
5440.54,5442.54, Did they die in the service of dirt far?
5443.82,5446.14, Way to go James not the end
5447.42,5449.42, There's a lot of rich
5449.42,5451.42, Not the end at the end

5471.9,5475.34," You know, what is it that you're buying to make you so angry when it doesn't come out right?"
5475.34,5477.34," All right, as a headset"
5477.34,5480.860000000001, Now we all gonna get to the floor. That's a little known one-up.com
5480.860000000001,5485.22, Fact is that we have a candy machine that quite often refuses to dispense with its candy
5485.22,5489.54, About one in three times. Yeah after you put your money in or any so you hear people cursing in yelling
5489.54,5490.54, But Ryan
5490.54,5496.38, One of the smaller guys on staff just no fans is a snack. She guys. I'm just waiting I hate you. Yeah
5496.38,5501.38, He actually pounds this machine like no other and I did like goddamn candy
5506.26,5510.9800000000005, I guess you do don't you and you're also the author of those angry notes so up on the thing right?
5510.9800000000005,5514.9400000000005, I'm supposed to know so I'll ever go to your candy guy
5516.26,5520.9800000000005," Yeah, I guess when Ryan is in a lot I usually hear somebody else like in futility trying to like get the stuff out"
5520.9800000000005,5523.26, I walk over and I I got down to a science now
5523.26,5526.58, I give it a couple good shakes and I get like three extra pieces of candy as a result
5526.58,5529.52, I can't spit it over though. I'm not I
5529.52,5535.22, That's why everyone else is fun because you're getting extras and then when when the little like screw turns on there
5535.22,5539.68," Turn it pushes it about halfway out, but not quite enough to fall down than they call him me again"
5541.22,5543.22, It's like it's a blessing in a curse
5543.860000000001,5548.900000000001, I'm just gonna in that in that conclusion you read as is gonna say as a that's what not that
5548.900000000001,5553.14," I'm like a creative writing teacher whatever, but I've done my share of writing over the years and as"
5553.62,5556.780000000001, Think and as you read it when you're writing your conclusion to your book
5556.900000000001,5560.26, You probably don't want to use phrases like here to do more unheard of
5561.06,5563.7, Why why are you for unheard of aliens?
5565.22,5570.9800000000005, Really roll off the tongue as you kind of wind up your knowledge. They're here to fall on hot of aliens and the year of a lot
5573.9800000000005,5577.820000000001, The god I done farmers knew that their sacrifice was not in vain
5578.34,5583.42," Well, they had provided the players of the nod side of the game with an additional"
