0.0,5.2, Hello and welcome to the July 2nd edition of not GFW radio
5.84,11.4, Our usual host and editor-in-chief Jeff Green is out on a three-week vacation and
12.24,15.72, Sean Elliott is tending to other business and cannot be here today
16.0,22.580000000000002, So you are stuck with me Ryan Scott this week and you're vocal output has like
23.240000000000002,25.240000000000002," Shot up 6,000 percent"
25.240000000000002,27.240000000000002," Well, awesome"
27.56,36.0, So with me today is Anthony Geige goes yes and we're gonna also sure I'm so jealous of
37.0,43.599999999999994," Oh, oh, you're wearing a gild of calamitous and tension. It tells you that's possibly the best shirt ever"
44.76,46.76, Super limited
46.76,50.72, And also with me is Terry scooter new in hi
51.12,55.04, It's a one-way situation on my own and newly
55.04,57.04, newly
57.04,58.04, I'm unemployed
58.04,60.04, One-up editor indeed
60.68,66.4," I haven't dentist I X nightmare. Oh, I'm the previous guy he hates me more than everyone else"
67.88,71.24, So as you have might say we have a lot to talk about
72.08,75.12, We have the deal of low three announcement
76.28,82.16," Yeah, and double three how was that work clicking break it down for us? There's a lot of clicking there's a lot of hacking"
82.52,89.56, Slashing colors lots of colors people don't like colors apparently I've heard you described as the skeleton click game
90.0,92.32, That's that's how I've heard it broken down skeleton click
92.64,101.34, That was Sean's reductive I was a skill analysis. I was a skeleton click with lots of like green and orange and red and it doesn't look
101.34,108.52, Jobbo enough according to the petition when they announced I shit though where people in the audience today like game journalists who are normally like
108.75999999999999,114.32," Reserved yeah, did they start woping and stuff like that? No, not even before a time at one"
114.32,117.32, They're like strumming. They like weird banjo version of the main theme
117.72,127.03999999999999," Also, I knew you realized what it was and it's like oh my god except in like French and German and English and I don't lose Becca Stanley"
127.03999999999999,129.04, I guess maybe
129.76,133.35999999999999, Was it but this isn't just an event for press right? There's like a lot of things
133.36,137.78, It's called a worldwide invitation also. It's kind of like the European version of Blizzcon
138.4,144.92000000000002, Which I guess also was kind of the American version of the Korean worldwide invitation. What basically if you're a blizzard fan
144.92000000000002,150.60000000000002, You pay money to go to this place and just like play games check them out
150.76000000000002,157.20000000000002, You also actually I think the fun is lying with the fact that the longest line in this whole thing was aligned to the blizzard store
157.52,162.9, So after paying money to go to get a ticket and paying money to get to this particular foreign Paris
163.38000000000002,165.64000000000001, People were saying a line to give blizzard more money
166.24,168.24," Yeah, did you get any shit?"
168.24,173.44000000000003, There was a cool ship because what milk in I both and actually shut no milkie told me about it
173.44000000000003,177.88000000000002, I kind of remember but I remember that more with Sean Maloy actually point about the person at Blizzcon
178.36,181.56, Whereas he's also a Murloc figurine that come in like a nice set
181.72000000000003,185.76000000000002, They didn't even have dough. It was like mostly a lot of same stuff that they had at Blizzcon
185.76000000000002,190.44000000000003, Which I didn't buy the first time and I think the only new thing was that there's a Diablo three shirt that was like unveiled
190.44000000000003,192.0, That's as good as that yeah
192.04,197.04, It was like this fine. We actually look at like there's like order meant you order like a like a menu style
197.04,199.36, Like they actually give you a form that you tick up what you want
199.84,204.0," You know, so good like decide on your way to actually the time the moment when you get to the line"
204.0,208.2, Like tell it to tell the cashier what you want and actually I realized that in version one
208.44,214.06," You know, there'll be like 52 items but items 10 and 11 were missing is just it went like I don't know"
214.06,215.16, It's dark cop shirt
215.16,219.48, I love 12 like world of orc cop shirt after the others we got now
219.48,221.48, Like so they're on announce things
222.92,225.58, But but so after after the else we got now
225.58,230.08, I'll send order order menu version two point-oh came out and it says like you know
230.08,231.72, Diablo shirt man's a Diablo shirt women
231.72,239.56, So those are the the new things for the store. What was the largest shirt says that they had for Diablo shirts like I'm trying how many X's I don't
239.56,245.4, Let's see I'm trying to think it probably was safely around three I think I don't think I don't think we quite hidden
245.4,249.32, You know the couch couch fatty for or above yet
249.32,253.16, I think three is a nice conservative. It's in flashbacks to Ryan's mom's closet
255.88,260.86," Did you have to bring that up here? No, just getting uh yeah"
260.86,264.46, There's also the stock on board game which was like a hundred and
265.16,270.68, Like 25 euros which makes it like a 250 dollar board game like holy shit
270.68,275.64, There's like space rocks and it's something but I don't know there's a lot a lot of things
275.64,281.16, Shit that I saw I like blizzcon but for a lot more money because the euro is really powerful compared to the dollar
281.16,285.08, Did they did they give it another goody bag with another world of work have many pet
286.04,289.96000000000004, There was a pet but I haven't checked I haven't followed up on it lately
289.96000000000004,293.56, But I didn't know that as with a weekend the pet was a quite emblematic as there's all these people like
293.56,299.72, To be to you we were my pet where my miniature see I only remember what the pet is because it can't be a Diablo because they right
299.72,301.64000000000004, Have a miniature Diablo so it could be I don't know of
302.28000000000003,304.28000000000003, Freaking like maybe too many angel
305.40000000000003,310.44000000000005," Yeah, you know you should you actually we kind of cool. I'm gonna be just one was not a miniature angel now, but I actually"
311.08000000000004,313.64000000000004, I have a decide which character to put because I think the pets are usually
314.12,319.88000000000005, Freezy vans are only like a sound of one character and I just have a decide which one to give it to whenever I decide to renew it
319.88000000000005,324.20000000000005, But goody bad king with that came like the collectible card game
324.76000000000005,329.16, You know if you like playing magic but with like actual like strong
329.16,334.84000000000003, Vanguard the orc instead of whatever magic works that haven't magic a gathering a little figurine
334.84000000000003,339.48, Which actually I should bring your office to decorate the one to be my one little decoration at desk
339.48,344.52000000000004, I guess until I actually get a real office. Are you got decorations though since you're sitting in child Malois old office
344.52000000000004,349.56," True, I love ship behind true actually as you come into I have like a lot of wild stuff and like a nice"
349.56,352.04, Bottle wide as well to go along on my wild play
353.08000000000004,355.08000000000004, To be the sophisticated and
355.24,362.03999999999996, Regular like you have advertised it for all the other people that were at the word my invitation stuff and a backpack that says
362.2,368.03999999999996, Blizzard will my invitation 2008 Paris did you actually get to see like I don't know all I've seen is a
368.68,374.36, That theatrical trailers and like the gameplay footage that they released like is that all you guys got to see there too?
374.36,376.03999999999996, Or did they actually go like yeah?
376.03999999999996,381.4, There's I mean I mean I'm assuming to fool yourself probably snip us from the long do you see the long like 20 minute demo
381.71999999999997,385.0," I saw like a 12 minute demo or something like that. Yeah, there's I mean there's like a long structure"
385.0,389.15999999999997, Then one of my guys like I'm a barbarian. I'm gonna start and he's runs through a dungeon fight some dudes and
389.32,394.35999999999996, Goes outside fight some more dudes and gets like killed by stuff that's pretty much like the main presentation that he had
394.59999999999997,399.4," They had a lot of panels and stuff, but it wasn't much more game like only bits of gameplay that was shows like"
399.64,404.59999999999997, When they were discussing like this is why we make this fireball into a fire bomb because that's different
405.23999999999995,407.56, Apparently and it should like the guys are gonna fire bomb like yep
407.72,411.72, That's that's what he's doing he's throwing a fireball my guys are here's a monster being poisonous
411.72,416.84," Yep, that's a monster being poisonous so it's just snip us, but nothing really more than what you people already seen"
417.16,423.4, So it did they like show any crazy world of workcraft stuff there like um deaf here's the album on
423.4,428.52, I mean they did have playable starcraft two and ratha glitch king starcraft two was literally
429.4,436.2, Like the same build that the press had played a couple months earlier the only real differences that they added like AI difficulty like you could play as
436.68,442.03999999999996," Play against easy-serg or medium human or hard pro toss, but that's literally only difference I saw"
442.68,444.92, Rathilich king was pretty much the same as what we saw
445.4,448.28, What the press saw at the not even domain differences there was
448.84,453.4," Playable death nights, but it was actually not an ideal situation because they were level 55"
454.36,457.56, And every freaking computer I played a lot on either the person had dies
457.56,463.48, They had red sickness and would like you know be punching like wolves for like 22 damage with their bare hands or
463.56,467.56, They broke all their equipment. I'm like man you got the shit kicked out you so many times that
468.12,472.92, None of my almost half my skills as a death night were not usable because it says requires melee weapon
472.92,474.92, And all my weapons were broken
474.92,482.68, So basically like basically my my things thing like man Europeans are lame at being death nights because every death night played was like other dead or broken
483.48,486.68, Did they have their own food at the invitational like I'm imagining like
487.16,490.44, They're at the actual like a crockle is same with your son
490.44,494.84," See that that stuff is that the blizzard cafeteria at their headquarters, but I just think it's new"
494.84,499.32," You're no over-priced your PN food, but at the blizzard cafe they do have like seen food"
499.88,503.8, Which is actually cheaper and I think totally better than the food of how to the EA cafe
504.28,506.28, But I don't know whether that's gonna look a start to cafe
508.04,512.6, And actually and I still I have a friend works at YouTube. I still have yet actually either the YouTube cafe
512.6,514.6, I heard a YouTube cafe is pretty awesome
514.92,518.52, How come we don't have a cafe we just have some crappy pee to downstairs
519.48,525.3199999999999," And you know what at least the IGN food trip area they have the Hattachi cafe, which is one of the worst cafes"
525.3199999999999,533.48," I've eaten that we got like amazing dining opportunities all around us, so yeah, we do that when you like flames or"
534.28,538.12, Or least Chinese food restaurant this the place genre first to is hobo fingers
539.8,545.4," Yeah, those places are better than the Hattachi cafe that both future and IGN have access to I guarantee you"
546.04,547.0799999999999, So
547.0799999999999,552.52," Work it's just for the lunch options, so indeed so you've been super busy for us"
552.84,560.1999999999999, You went to the Diablo thing but right before that I went to Vegas a shoot some guns are you serious for so calm?
560.52,561.9599999999999," Okay, I got like I"
561.9599999999999,566.04, It's not as bad I do have some marks on my arm from the sniper rifle. I let me shoot
566.04,571.64, I heard there was some dude from IGN there at this event. I recently went to I don't know his name
571.96,578.4399999999999, So but he was he was complaining that he shot like the 50 cow on it totally fucked up is arm for like the next week or something like that
578.4399999999999,581.0," Yeah, the the seals gave us like"
581.16,585.88, Three three gift different kinds of salt rifles two shotguns two pistols a couple
586.36,590.52, Some machine guns a grenade launcher and two different kind of sniper rifles
591.16,595.72, What was crazy is good I all I learned about guns from video games so I made some kind of like oh
596.12,598.68," Yeah, this sniper rifle is this like the anti"
598.8399999999999,603.0, Vehicle one and then they was like really happy. I've apparently knew they said like hell yeah
603.0,604.76, I'm gonna show you what that music is people
605.7199999999999,610.68," He killed me the anti person no one's like yeah, that was split guy open like a watermelon if you hit them like so wow"
610.68,615.3199999999999, That's kind of terrifying so they were cool like they weren't like looking down on you
615.3199999999999,621.3199999999999, No actually they were really I mean one guy was the guy with a sniper was a little bit on the like I'm really happy about shooting things
621.3199999999999,625.24, Job everyone was actually pretty chill. I think some of the guys were actually kind of a background
625.24,629.5600000000001," It's just like well, I've shot other guns before just not anything this nice, but they weren't like"
629.8,632.04, Probably I guess the last hundred is a Navy seal event
632.04,635.64, They were like really kind of looking down and like a note being real aggro all the time
635.64,638.2, They kind of doubted about their more little more chill. They're like oh yeah
638.2,643.32, You want to let's just shoot some stuff down the target range for fun. Did you fire grenade launcher about you right there? I did fire grenade launcher
643.32,644.6800000000001, It was a
644.6800000000001,648.84, Flare grenade launcher because they weren't allowed to use like high explosive rounds in the middle of desert
649.4,651.8," Okay, but but I almost hit a car"
651.9599999999999,655.24, I was gonna say did you make it good? Would you have made a good shot?
655.9599999999999,659.0799999999999," No, I realized like I was doing something on a sniper any game man"
659.0799999999999,663.88, I can't be a sniper to save my life in real life because it got to be like go look at like that foot
664.1999999999999,667.56, Go look at that push with that rock on my island even see what push you're talking about dude
667.56,671.8, It all looks brown you're talking to find something green and then when I actually made the shot
671.8,674.92, I like couldn't see what I was shooting like I have no idea of my hit the target or not
675.8,679.4, I'm see jack-toms and all those people they are not mercenalic of man
679.4,684.28, I can I shoot to save my life and that they I barely hit a target close range for like an MP5
684.28,689.72, Which is I just spit out whole bunch of bullets really fast a short range. I like barely even barely hit a target with that one
691.0,694.68," All right, I'm gonna be evasion occurs. We're not gonna give you a gun"
695.64,698.4399999999999," Yeah, do you know I'm sorry I'll probably hit a yes"
698.84,704.28, For the last line of defense so what was this for for so come yeah and then before that was a
704.68,707.4, GFW event I think or it's around the same time
707.4,713.64," Yeah, here they had some good stuff there. Yeah, like a you know is it tycoon the whole kung fu panda"
713.64,716.28, Oh kung fu pandan wally we're two of there
716.76,721.72, They're highlight titles and I noticed like wally had the two cute girls working the booth
722.04,724.04, So that people would actually maybe
724.1999999999999,727.16, Go out on the limb so wally was there high profile title
727.3199999999999,732.76, It was pretty good. It was listed on like the whole flyer they had for it looked like the front of a classic movie theater
732.84,739.72, And I was one of the movies listed on the marquee like was like wally Kung fu panda was really actually there
740.6,745.3199999999999," Was what because it was listed on that same poster, but I don't remember seeing it there"
745.3199999999999,750.68, Now there's no red faction that I saw anyway all right the coolest games that they had like it was funny
750.68,754.68, Two because they had like a stalker type demo going on but since it wasn't like a game's ruined
754.68,759.08, Is they had it like shoved in a bathroom? There's a tech demo that's show like why a
759.08,765.88," $600 video card a cool yeah, that's a real card makes awesome when you like want to drop a cloth on to a round object"
765.88,770.76," A corner to that that's a thing though. Yeah, this so they the big thing they were showing though is you know like how in video like"
771.48,773.48, Aquired a geo physics or whatever
773.72,777.96, They were showing a heck out even with a single good card or with two cards running in a celli
778.36,783.6400000000001, You could dedicate one GPU to just do physics like unlike anything you could do right now
784.12,787.08, So they showed like soft bodies added to like unreal three
787.5600000000001,792.44, So like they had this tech demo where it was like this gigantic worm monster and as it would come after you
792.84,798.2800000000001, The door would be like way smaller than the monster was so the thing would have to like squish through the doorway
798.9200000000001,801.32, Like it's muscular turret after kind of slide through
802.12,808.44," Just seem potential like that for games he said it'll be a couple years though before we actually see yeah, what's wolves nice like that implemented"
808.76,812.12, If I understood the way it said correctly like you could kind of doesn't any card
812.12,814.9200000000001, It has like even if you bought a new video card
814.92,816.92, I don't know what to do the only could have you all and just be your physics
817.16,822.28," Yeah, it's exactly though the demo machine they had it literally was like I think it was like three or four"
822.28,825.8, Cars because there's two cars SLA for the graphics running a one call for the physics. I'm like
826.36,831.0, Holy crap you're gonna like run a small like nuclear plant your house just like have you know
831.24,833.4, Claw fall on like some aliens face better
833.7199999999999,839.0799999999999," Yeah, I came it was a tech demo. Yeah, I mean you look like something that could be cool. Oh"
839.3199999999999,843.88," Definitely yeah, I mean like they showed like there's they showed like a physics one of five version of U. T3"
843.88,848.84, We're like walls collect collapse and you could shoot out cover and stuff like that and that was like something
848.84,853.08, They said that people could get right now like that that's available right now to play you teeth three like that
853.4,855.4, Right so I mean
855.4,859.72, Like but like they said it'll be a while before developers actually like implement it
859.72,864.92, But it's better than like the older turn and evolution of like having to buy physics card which known was ever gonna do
865.48,869.88, Well now like we said earlier like hey that's really something to do with like your old video car
869.88,875.08, Rather than like try to sell and craigslist for um they're gonna change like a basket of watermelons or something
875.16,877.16, Which I actually did kind of do once
878.04,881.24, Specifically for watermelons actually sold a fridge for watermelons
882.2,883.48, And Berkeley
883.48,885.72, That sounds about right but I
885.96,891.0, Other games that they had there like the space siege space siege is the only one they had those PC exclusive
891.48,893.88, Like other non-peaceful well colonization
894.2,898.28, That's right that's right but colonization is like an expansion pack rather it's like it's just weird
898.28,902.04, It's that weird thing like it uses it's because you don't need to look at it
902.04,906.76," It's telling is his own game was not quite it's it's like based in the civil war engine, but it's like a"
906.76,911.88," No backton old it's it's yeah, it's because like a sequel to like 1994 is like Sid Meyer game"
911.88,918.2," Well calling nice in yeah, okay, and so other than that they had like buying a commando playing with the next box 360 controller"
918.2,920.68," Wait, is this the new one or the this is the new buying a commanda?"
920.68,922.68," Yeah, yeah, not not the like"
922.68,928.5999999999999, Rebound rearmed rearmed the actual buying a commando and they had DMC4
929.16,934.92," Yeah, I played this when I had a game pattern achievements and then they also played they also had a"
936.12,939.0, Cod for CD5 no Cod world at war
939.0,941.0," No, no, no CD world at war"
941.0,944.5999999999999, I'm not playable just you could watch a person play you go watch a guy guy guy
944.5999999999999,948.5999999999999, I put out with a cigar and they had ghost besters there as well that you couldn't
949.16,952.4399999999999, Play that you could check out which actually I was surprised to look kind of cool
953.64,956.04, When you don't that doesn't sound bad go
956.04,958.28, I wish they were more and I mean just a whole lineup sounds
958.76,960.52, You're not quite interesting
960.52,964.8399999999999, It's interesting how they would like they melt they probably talk about like yeah crisis war has
964.8399999999999,971.3199999999999, Can we exclusive and they don't have it there right? I mean I don't know is that is that oh that'll probably be a shift W game crisis was
971.88,977.88," Yeah, I mean it was just like I just don't know if it was like a timing thing or some people are holding out for E3 or what but like"
978.28,983.0, Besides spacey I mean spacey just did look cool though for people that like dungeon siege and dungeon crawlers
983.0,987.0, Which you know since apparently a whole bunch of people on Paris like dungeon crawlers
987.0,988.28, Because that's what forget yeah
988.52,990.4399999999999, Paris and rotational was a battle right I mean
991.4,994.76, PC games like especially like that so really well over there and this one's
995.24,997.88, Totally got all the things from dungeon siege except you can
998.36,1004.2, Is there still a pack of meal or is that pack a robot now there's you do all you it's totally actually different
1004.2800000000001,1007.88, You don't get a party in a way you only get yourself in one other character and that's it
1008.44,1010.84, And then you modify yourself with cybernetics
1011.24,1017.32, So the whole game is a question of how much of your humanity will you sacrifice to succeed to save humanity?
1017.72,1020.9200000000001, So it's a you know shadow around it's an age old question
1022.0400000000001,1026.92, So what happens when you're like you know everything except like your your knuckles a robot
1027.16,1032.76," Yeah, that's the thing you can max it out it'll change the endings supposedly there's multiple endings depending on how human you are"
1033.4,1038.6, So not to be confused with two human which I hear is not enough human is kind of a similar way
1038.92,1041.4," So yeah, that's that's the alternate name for space age"
1043.8799999999999,1045.8799999999999, So that comes out
1045.8799999999999,1049.48," Action month yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean the same school"
1049.48,1054.36, I mean those guys have definitely made good games like that in the past and it was definitely looking really good
1055.24,1058.68, I don't know and it's not all totally dice rolls like it used to be you can actually like
1059.16,1064.92, Take some initiative and dodge shots that are coming at you and stuff as opposed to like a this arrow will hit you because
1065.24,1067.88, The numbers have crunched it said it will so
1069.0,1074.52," But yeah, I'm trying to think what else was the service is it like the actual space age"
1074.52,1079.0800000000002, Or they're like lots of big things and space sitting around just shooting big cannons at other things now
1079.0800000000002,1081.0800000000002, It all takes place on one gigantic ship
1081.5600000000002,1085.72, But the ship is like a gigantic world chip so it there are very environments like
1086.1200000000001,1088.76," Parks and stuff like that green and stuff, you know"
1089.48,1094.3600000000001," Parks and greens what I'm saying yeah, so they wanted to be like there's like jungle parts and stuff like that because it's like a world"
1094.76,1098.92, Ship not just like is there is there ice part the ship is there a lava part of ship?
1098.92,1104.2, I wouldn't not all be surprised if that turned out to be the case who who was a green light a
1104.2,1107.56, Lava part of the show like you know what this show these is lava a lava room
1108.1200000000001,1110.1200000000001, That's like we're at get to energy
1110.28,1115.3999999999999, But one of the cooler things about the show is actually talking to the dude that's in charge of all the
1116.1999999999998,1121.84, The devices that they make because they were handing out Microsoft sidewinder. Oh
1122.2399999999998,1126.1999999999998," Okay, yeah, that's right the mouth would wait. Yeah, so they guy was telling me like"
1126.6799999999998,1129.8799999999999, He totally wants to give some of us a two or some times of like there
1129.8799999999999,1135.2399999999998, I love misfit controllers that they like because he said there's a bunch of shit
1135.2399999999998,1139.9599999999998, They developed that they they'd like toss away ultimately because it's not like it could work
1140.04,1146.28," Amazingly, but it's aesthetically so ugly. Oh, they didn't give it. I mean like I can't wait to see that kind of because there were some peripherals"
1146.28,1149.96, Like they did release in a market that were like what the hell are they thinking like this is bizarre
1149.96,1155.96, Sidewinder or be thing that like involves like twisting and like it looks like a weird like Rubik's cute kind of action
1155.96,1160.0, Like triggers and shit and like I don't know what the hell that was it was for first-person shooters
1160.0,1163.4, That's right. I was like late in late 90s and like if that made it out to market
1163.4,1166.3600000000001, What the hell do they red end up rejecting like all right?
1166.6,1171.6399999999999, Here's a thing that you'll use your nose to like fly airplanes with things like well
1172.12,1177.1599999999999," That type of shit does kind of look track track yeah, just about a GDC and you'll see weird fucking shit like that"
1177.1599999999999,1181.9599999999998, But I like the word I know actually I have I didn't go see the weird mind control thing
1181.9599999999998,1188.76," So that the thing when you guys see that GDC yeah, and it seems to work kind of so but yeah, I mean they use like a"
1189.3999999999999,1191.6399999999999, A 3D printer like those wild figurines
1191.96,1197.8000000000002, So they'll just like sketch out a concept of a mouse and then also no disparate 3D you can copy feeling it
1197.8000000000002,1202.94, I told him they should design a mouse that feels like my girlfriend's hand so when I'm playing games
1202.94,1204.94, I'm like holding your hands and I'm never alone
1209.24,1211.24, Nothing I have a girlfriend
1211.5600000000002,1216.1200000000001, For obvious reasons hey wait hold on though wait let's back out your second
1217.48,1220.92, What about your your your message intrude at
1220.92,1228.44," E.B. Is that is there been any more? I'm young still talking to a person yeah, but there hasn't really been much to report other than that and"
1228.76,1231.88, You obviously have not raised up the whole mouse hand issue
1233.88,1238.44, I'm still thinking about that like wow no and by no means what I call that girl girl friend
1238.44,1243.0800000000002," You know, so just just wanted a date. Yeah, I'm sure there are a lot of people that do"
1243.64,1249.5600000000002, curious people what they have fucking board posters ruined my my desire to continue to talk about it though
1249.8799999999999,1254.04, I know the second the second someone figured out where where this person was located
1254.04,1259.08," They're like so you they figured out. Yeah, they were like they were like they were all and someone's like I'm going there tonight"
1259.08,1262.46, And the other board posters will like take a picture and post it on the forum
1262.46,1265.6399999999999," Good day. Oh no, they're safely deal"
1265.6399999999999,1269.48, There are other friends have actually had the reason to talk them to I love doing that
1270.2,1274.44, Stalkerish that would that would have ruined my life for a little bit
1274.9199999999998,1276.9199999999998, So
1276.92,1282.28," That's it all I did is just encourage them to do even easy internet people will do that. Yeah, yeah"
1284.52,1286.52, So games
1286.52,1288.52, I've only been playing
1289.0800000000002,1292.76, You know the same old shit company here's better. I've also been playing some instant action
1293.24,1298.92, But I don't want to talk too much about that because Roy Manion has a feature coming out about it soon
1299.48,1301.88, I don't want to steal his fire talking about all the
1302.3600000000001,1306.68, We said ventures in that what are we do play as a couple of heroes? I play a bridge
1306.92,1312.52, But I can no longer play that because I played a 2v2 me and Duncan versus Sean and Roy the other day
1312.52,1317.64, We beat them really bad and it wasn't like it wasn't because of like any misplaying on
1318.28,1319.88, Sean and Roy's part is just because like
1320.44,1322.92, Brits are kind of broken so I
1323.24,1328.68," Feel bad like I actually didn't even enjoy winning like I normally be like fuck I beat Sean and Roy, but after that"
1328.68,1331.0, I was just like I feel like a scumbag
1331.0,1335.8000000000002," So I got to learn to play a different army now. Well, it's not like you can just walk in and"
1336.68,1338.68, When by knowing nothing
1339.24,1343.6399999999999, It's what is there I may have a play Brits well is there a particular tree of air that makes them like
1343.6399999999999,1348.28," Obsately unfair now or no, it's just their ability to build in placements everywhere like I know"
1348.28,1355.0," Okay, it's like a a crutch of their army, but they're just too cheap for something. It's just like okay. I don't know you'd have to see the replay"
1355.3999999999999,1359.8," So but yeah, you know instant action everyone should go check it out. It's free"

1409.24,1415.16," Alphabile I straight up lost that long time ago, but I didn't have like a Alphabile of half life at some point where like"
1415.8,1421.32, There's like it's a the demo that just showed off the different systems one of them was like an animation system where they said look look
1421.3999999999999,1426.6," Is a robot dancing of the original half life yeah, it was like it's it was actually I'm so pissed off"
1426.6,1431.6399999999999, I lost that particular disc because it was like the most awesome is because like the barring looks completely different back then
1431.6399999999999,1435.32," And it was detect them all that they want to show the publishers say like hey, we're a vow"
1435.32,1440.6, We have this i technology like what we have colored lighting that light is green that light is red
1440.9199999999998,1445.72, It's not just white and dark. It's multiple colors like one room all this is color lighting

1459.08,1464.6," Yep, like the hundred dollar like lithographs that are signed by an artist they like sold out and like listen today"
1464.6,1470.2," Since there was a point when you know how they have those like pledge companion cubes. Yeah, there was a point when they ran out of those"
1470.2,1475.24, And they were going on eBay for like some obscene amount of money. I know because you like I am I just don't understand
1475.24,1477.24," I mean, yeah"

1660.4399999999998,1667.96, Since I you know only those systems. I'm a like I remember there were some point in my teenagers where I had to convince myself that it was finally okay to like
1668.4399999999998,1673.08, Throw away all the cards that all my figures came on you know what I'm saying like like all like a
1673.72,1680.76, Like all of my G. I just I had like their bio card bio card. I was like fucking told you like what what which ninja cleanse

1685.8,1689.96, But I was like it told you it told you all about how shipwreck grew up in Louisiana
1690.76,1693.48," Wow, I see everything serious about that actually"
1694.1999999999998,1697.1599999999999, I just made it up. I'm wouldn't be surprised I actually turned out to be right
1698.04,1701.72," God, I'd be so sad I realized I'm gonna go go that right now after this"
1702.2,1710.68, So can you can you add your warcraft to bound at a different city key not I think I think the down the digital key down low is only support for a
