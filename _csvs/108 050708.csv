0.0,5.2, Hello and welcome to GFW Radio.
5.2,8.64," It is May 7th, 2008."
8.64,10.24, And I'm here with the full crew.
10.24,11.24, We're back reunited.
11.24,13.24, And I feel so good.
13.24,16.88, And we even have Max Chosos today.
16.88,17.88, Joining.
17.88,21.8, And we have a very special guest who will introduce in a moment who took time out of his
21.8,25.2, busy schedule to come talk to us.
25.2,26.68, And I think you all will be excited about that.
26.68,30.4," First, I want you guys to go on the table and introduce yourselves."
30.4,32.28, Ryan Scott.
32.28,33.28, Robert Ashley.
33.28,34.28, Sean Ely.
34.28,35.28, Sean Malloy.
35.28,36.28," Hi, gentlemen."
36.28,37.28, Hello.
37.28,40.76, And sitting in the coveted sixth chair today is.
40.76,41.76, It's a.
41.76,42.760000000000005, It's a coveted.
42.760000000000005,44.760000000000005, Thanks.
44.760000000000005,48.32, I'm glad you caught that.
48.32,52.760000000000005, The Corpulent Six chair is a joke.
52.76,58.839999999999996, Can you might know him more commonly as Kane from the command of conquer series.
58.839999999999996,61.28, And so he's sitting here right now.
61.28,65.52," And so want to say hi to the folks out there, Kane."
65.52,71.2, You can't kill the mess.
71.2,72.84, That's good.
72.84,75.8, That was one of my favorite lines.
75.8,77.68," I think it's Kane in the game, Joe."
77.68,79.12," Yeah, he's not really here."
79.12,87.48," In fact, Robert Ashley is holding his body with a, with that has a spring where a head"
87.48,89.08000000000001, should be drawn on the head.
89.08000000000001,90.88000000000001," And Sean Ely, it's drawing on the head."
90.88000000000001,92.88000000000001, I'm giving him a surprise.
92.88000000000001,93.88000000000001, That's what he said.
93.88000000000001,96.16, I think it's like an oil slick phone.
96.16,97.16, It's looks.
97.16,102.16," We decided that before we came down here, that this had actually Sean Ely made the"
102.16,103.16, other observation.
103.16,106.68, I'll give him the credit that this is probably the bubble head from some like baseball
106.68,112.28," player that you know, they had a couple thousand extras at the factory in China and"
112.28,114.68, just decided to turn this one into Kane.
114.68,116.76," Because the head, I mean, this guy could be anybody."
116.76,118.76, He looks like the body.
118.76,121.12, Like what baseball player wears a cape like this.
121.12,123.08000000000001, He's a tip or a trench cover.
123.08000000000001,124.08000000000001, Short stop.
124.08000000000001,125.08000000000001, Center field there.
125.08000000000001,127.84," Yeah, so we don't really have a special guest."
127.84,132.0," We're sorry if that if you feel bad now, we deceive you."
132.0,133.32," Actually, we don't feel bad."
133.32,136.36, I don't feel bad at all.
136.36,137.36, So here we are.
137.36,138.36, We're all back.
138.36,139.56, We didn't podcast last week.
139.56,140.56, Now we're all here.
140.56,141.56, Max Jils here.
141.56,144.20000000000002," How you been there, Mr. Ashley?"
144.20000000000002,145.20000000000002, Dandy.
145.20000000000002,146.20000000000002, Dandy?
146.20000000000002,147.20000000000002, I don't know.
147.20000000000002,148.20000000000002, I don't know.
148.20000000000002,149.56, Are you better than you guys?
149.56,150.56, What do you mean?
150.56,151.56, What does that mean?
151.56,153.20000000000002, We're doing good.
153.20000000000002,155.20000000000002, That's rather presumptive view.
155.20000000000002,156.60000000000002, Did you think we're doing badly?
156.60000000000002,157.92000000000002," No, no, no."
157.92000000000002,160.08, You guys are great.
160.08,163.68, Although the band sort of has broken up.
163.68,164.68, Kind of.
164.68,169.44, That we were going to continue GFW online form.
169.44,170.44, I guess you guys do.
170.44,171.44," Well, we are."
171.44,175.0, But Ryan and I are now sort of not part of that.
175.0,177.04000000000002," Well, I wouldn't go that far."
177.04000000000002,178.04000000000002, We don't want to.
178.04000000000002,183.52," Well, we sort of have more than just that on our plate."
183.52,185.8, But we do have that GFW stuff.
185.8,188.12," You'll always be part of GFW online, Sean."
188.12,189.12, Right.
189.12,190.12, So it's your home.
190.12,191.12, Responsibilities.
191.12,192.12, I'd expand it beyond.
192.12,193.12, Right.
193.12,199.0," And if I, in the, in the ever evolving reorganization of one up.com, should Mr."
199.0,203.44, Sean Elliott's now the features editor across the board and Ryan Scott has reviewed
203.44,204.44, editor.
204.44,210.88, So they have both PC and console things under their wing as well.
210.88,213.84, But still part of GFW radio.
213.84,214.84, Right.
214.84,219.36, And really it was kind of a nice envelope of confidence for our team here for you guys
219.36,220.88, to get that extra responsibility.
220.88,221.88, That's that.
222.12,222.92, Yes indeed.
223.92,224.76, Here.
224.76,226.12," They really love you, Sean."
226.12,226.72, They love you.
226.72,227.96, True.
227.96,229.32, You are love it.
229.32,232.48, I don't love for your ability to draw on Jokek and Ted like that.
232.48,233.84," Yeah, you're going to run out of space."
233.84,237.76, He's using a sharpie to draw in this guy's face and it's turning into you
237.76,241.0, basically just a molten black.
241.0,244.64, He could very easily be like a species on Star Trek.
244.64,246.0," Oh, I want to compare this."
246.0,250.6," I don't think we're, we're getting into the spirit of how this chat he was intended."
250.6,254.48, We're probably supposed to be like be excited that we got the cane doll.
254.48,257.2," No, we're there for be pimping the next command and conquer."
257.2,258.88, You're supposed to put it on eBay.
258.88,259.88," Oh, are we?"
259.88,260.88," Well, we did."
260.88,262.24, We kind of unenchecked it.
262.24,264.96, But people always put this kind of brick a break on eBay.
264.96,266.36, You'll see it.
266.36,271.2," I mean, as our as our gauge last year after last year's ridiculous, the"
271.2,272.52, charge get the micro ridiculous.
272.52,273.52," Oh, yeah."
273.52,274.52, It was fine.
274.52,275.52, It was there.
275.52,277.96, But ridiculous to someone think that there's any value to what the ass pads that
277.96,278.96, ass pads we sat on.
279.44,280.84," Yeah, palas are crazy."
280.84,282.32," Well, I think it stacks of them."
282.32,283.28," Oh, my God."
283.28,288.08," What's the last year, D3, Microsoft held their big, you know, their big press"
288.08,289.64, conferencing at this outdoor.
289.64,291.52, It was like a high school stadium or something.
291.52,293.76," It was actually, yeah, it was exactly it was okay."
293.76,299.64," School's and it had, you know, cement, just cement stands."
299.64,304.4," And so Microsoft to put out on the ground for everybody, little, you know, ass"
304.4,305.24, pads basically.
305.24,307.84, And it had like Microsoft logo under something.
307.84,310.4, I don't know the Xbox 360 logo 360 logo.
310.4,310.91999999999996, Okay.
310.91999999999996,311.44, Maybe.
311.44,315.79999999999995," So we're sitting on these things, you know, and presumably many people in the audience"
315.79999999999995,316.76, tearing ass on them.
316.76,317.44, Right.
317.44,319.2, The hour and probably Sean for sure.
319.2,320.03999999999996, Right.
320.03999999999996,323.91999999999996," And then when the thing ended, you know, you could see dudes like running through"
323.91999999999996,325.84, the place like grabbing as many people could.
325.84,327.52," Oh, and to take with them."
327.52,331.03999999999996," So yeah, they're leaving the stadium with like 500 each arm."
331.03999999999996,335.2," And so of course, we got, uh, we got back from, you know, the convention."
335.2,336.15999999999997, I looked on eBay.
336.15999999999997,337.32," And of course, there they were."
338.15999999999997,338.44," Oh, yeah."
338.44,339.59999999999997, I'm sure they're going for it.
339.59999999999997,340.2, I don't remember.
340.2,342.32, We'll write cut the cheese on this one.
342.32,343.88, How it can be yours.
343.88,346.36, There is anything higher than zero bid on any of those.
346.36,347.56, It's kind of weird.
347.56,348.56," Hey, humanity."
348.56,349.08, Yeah.
349.08,353.88, I've been to previous E3s and it seems to me like most attendees have an
353.88,355.08, ass pad built in.
355.08,357.08, They don't need their own.
357.08,357.71999999999997, Yeah.
357.71999999999997,362.52," It is weird when you go to E3 and you see the people like, you know,"
362.52,365.92," streaming and yelling for, you know, you know, I want you to all"
365.92,370.12," scream you walk by a booth, you know, and say, I'm full of shit on the count of three."
370.12,372.28000000000003," And someone, he person's going to get a free t-shirt."
372.28000000000003,373.48, This is I'm full of shit.
373.48,376.0," I was like, 100 guys going."
376.0,379.20000000000005," And then you think like, man, people suck."
379.20000000000005,381.56, And then you realize this is like an industry of fan.
381.56,382.08000000000004, Right.
382.08000000000004,383.68, And then it's like twice as bad.
383.68,385.96000000000004," But yeah, I never really was an industry of it."
385.96000000000004,386.8, I guess not.
386.8,388.6," But that was an illusion, Jeff."
388.6,389.44, Was it?
389.44,389.96000000000004, Yeah.
389.96000000000004,392.20000000000005, They were other things to like where you can get a tattoo.
392.20000000000005,395.04," I think it was Capcom, us doing it one year or some other company."
395.04,397.48," You get some, you get a free, you don't get anything."
397.48,399.12, You get the tattoo free.
399.12,400.12, Yeah.
400.12,403.32, So people were getting like the brand stamped on them.
403.32,404.32, Real tattoo.
404.32,405.32, Real tattoo.
405.32,406.32," Yeah, not like some circus."
406.32,408.32000000000005, Like a mega man in the backstage.
408.32000000000005,409.32000000000005, Just painting shit.
409.32000000000005,411.6," No, it just would say the company's name."
411.6,414.20000000000005," Oh, but it wasn't like a real tattoo."
414.20000000000005,415.20000000000005, It wasn't real tattoo.
415.20000000000005,416.20000000000005, It was a real tattoo.
416.20000000000005,417.20000000000005, It was a real tattoo.
417.20000000000005,420.20000000000005, It would be like getting a tattoo that said Walmart on your fucking arm on your
420.20000000000005,421.20000000000005, face.
421.20000000000005,423.56," Well, Robert Robert does not want to believe this."
423.56,424.56, I didn't even.
424.56,425.56, I didn't even.
425.56,426.56, I just have no heart attack.
426.56,427.56, I didn't even.
427.56,430.56," Well, there's, that's what we could use this to go into like more specific game stuff."
430.56,433.2," But there's, there's that mentality where people think they're getting something for"
433.2,435.92, free and they can't help but do it.
435.92,439.44," You know, we're talking about like, why you're age-to-com and we'll just go into this."
439.44,440.44, The debate is out now.
440.44,441.44, A lot of people are not playing it.
441.44,442.8, Some of you guys are.
442.8,444.84000000000003," And at times like, is it good?"
444.84000000000003,447.8," Everyone in the server who's playing, it's like, well, it's an MMO."
447.8,449.04," You know, the answer is not good."
449.04,450.44," Like, what are you playing it?"
450.44,452.08, And it's like part of the spray.
452.08,453.96," And then also, it will tie into to Ryan."
453.96,457.76," It's going to, you know, we could talk about the changes to Team Fortress 2 later."
457.76,460.35999999999996," And, you know, farming points to get the new medic stuff."
460.35999999999996,461.84," And like, why?"
461.84,462.84, There's just this thing.
462.84,463.84, I don't know.
463.84,466.0," A lot of people they can't, it can't turn something down for free."
466.0,469.36," Same way like I heard that my grandma, you know, like, wasn't quite free."
469.36,474.32," But it was for, since it was for sale, just random shit like socks and crap that she"
474.32,475.96, find at Walmart and Dollar General.
475.96,478.12, She just couldn't help but get it because it was a value.
478.12,481.12, And to the point where her whole bedroom was covered in it.
481.12,484.48," She was sleeping on the couch and then like my mom and her sister found out and they were like,"
484.48,486.12," oh, God, they had to intervene."
486.12,489.04, But that's what she was hoarding cheap stuff.
489.04,491.2," Yeah, just like that should know a use for it."
491.2,492.2, It didn't even make sense.
492.2,493.88," Like men's socks and stuff, you know?"
493.88,498.48, Like some people are kind of like Ryan and you guys in the games you play.
498.48,501.88, And that's definitely one of those game mechanics.
501.88,507.64, Like I remember looking at borderlands for that game's from windows cover story a few
507.71999999999997,514.52, months back and realizing that that game is like a shooter plus like a men's ultimate
514.52,515.52, shopping trip.
515.52,516.92, Like that's what it's all about.
516.92,521.56, It's like you kill people so that you can browse their guns and pick up.
521.56,527.0," You know, I mean, that's really the motivation, you know?"
527.0,528.4," You're like, oh, I killed someone."
528.4,529.4, Where do they got?
529.4,530.4," Oh, what a great deal."
530.4,533.4," And of course, that's on the wall while you're job."
533.4,534.4," Yeah, yeah."
534.4,535.68, Look at the hooters on it.
536.1999999999999,538.52," Anyway, I'll take a double beer shot then."
539.52,541.92, I heard some of the early loot drops in the age of Conan M.
541.92,543.92," And we're like, Tattered loincloth."
543.92,545.04," Yeah, really?"
545.04,546.88," There's like all the early ones are like, you know,"
546.88,548.16," Tattered this, Tattered that."
548.16,549.68," Well, that's like any agmo."
549.68,552.16," But Tattered loincloth is, that's pretty bad."
552.16,552.8, Pretty bad.
552.8,557.28," Hey, when you're like, when you're a new tour ass of heart, you said it beats nothing."
557.28,559.28, It doesn't beat nothing.
559.28,562.3199999999999," And it wasn't that an option or you sent out a thread about that, right?"
562.4000000000001,564.8000000000001," Sean about the new to the, uh,"
564.8000000000001,565.72," Oh, how some of you did that?"
565.72,566.6, New to the protest.
566.6,571.6, There's a petition online yet to remove or to offer some version of the game where
571.6,573.6, there's no new to the at all.
573.6,574.84," Um, it was long there."
574.84,576.5600000000001, This was language stuff.
576.5600000000001,578.0400000000001," Yeah, they must have a toggle already."
578.0400000000001,580.6," I don't know if there is other, well, with this petition exist."
580.6,582.0400000000001," Yeah, that's weird."
582.0400000000001,584.08," It might just not be in the beta of the, uh,"
584.08,588.5600000000001," use the menu for the interface change like, no, I think twice since I started"
588.5600000000001,589.08, playing it.
589.08,590.44, So what's the extent?
590.9200000000001,593.24," I heard how to show you how like,"
593.24,595.08, sensitive to gender and sex issues.
595.08,597.48," The game is the first woman you come across in the game is like,"
597.48,598.9200000000001, tied to a stake or something.
598.9200000000001,600.44," She is tied to a,"
600.44,603.6400000000001," a tied to another stake, but like,"
603.6400000000001,606.7600000000001, a wooden beam and she is also a prostitute.
606.7600000000001,608.9200000000001," Uh, that's like,"
608.9200000000001,612.6," and later there's a quest where you have to talk to again,"
612.6,614.7600000000001, to get her filthy blood.
614.7600000000001,618.2," So she can, you can swap it with a pure version of blood and like ruin this."
618.2800000000001,619.88, Which you get her filthy blood.
619.88,620.4000000000001, Uh-huh.
620.4000000000001,621.0400000000001, Yeah.
621.0400000000001,622.76, That's literally in the prior horrible blood.
622.76,625.24, We need your hard blood to sabotage this ritual.
625.24,627.6400000000001," That's like that, a final tap scene."
627.6400000000001,628.1600000000001, Yeah.
628.1600000000001,630.5200000000001," And she's just like, I will be a lot of a whole."
630.5200000000001,631.8000000000001, You sure why not.
631.8000000000001,634.2, That's a can drink.
634.2,636.0400000000001, It's nothing wrong with being sexy.
636.0400000000001,637.4000000000001, Yeah.
637.4000000000001,639.48," But yeah, that's the first,"
639.48,642.48, the second person you'd actually first person to some guy you meet you on.
642.48,644.36," You wash up on the beach and he's like,"
644.36,645.72, you got a destination.
645.72,648.44," I'm, you know, if we talk too much about, uh,"
648.44,652.0400000000001," you know, the, the plight of females and games,"
652.0400000000001,653.72, we're going to get called soft.
653.72,656.84," Because that's what happened to me when I bitched about GTA and,"
656.84,658.0400000000001, and the one up show.
658.0400000000001,659.0, Who called you soft?
659.0,659.32, Who called you?
659.32,659.8000000000001, Yeah.
659.8000000000001,660.6, Some guy in the floor.
660.6,661.5600000000001, Someone you care about?
661.5600000000001,662.44, No.
662.44,666.84, He said the guy who looks like Nick Furry is soft.
666.84,667.8000000000001, I'm assuming he may be.
667.8000000000001,669.0, Yeah.
669.0,671.0," Well, I felt it furry, which made me happy."
671.0,671.88, That's totally Jeff.
671.88,674.0400000000001," But, but there were a few comments on the board."
674.12,677.8," We don't have to, we can transition into this later or not at all."
677.8,681.48," Hey, but this idea that, uh, that, uh,"
681.48,683.0799999999999," games like that, like, I guess,"
683.0799999999999,685.7199999999999," a decone and our GTA would be another one where like,"
685.7199999999999,688.04," come on, you know, these games are,"
688.04,691.48," are meant for dudes and, you know,"
691.48,694.04," why, why should it have to appeal to women?"
694.04,695.56, Why should GTA for?
695.56,698.04," Why should a decone and not have, you know,"
698.04,701.7199999999999," barbarian chicks with big hooters and, you know,"
701.7199999999999,703.8," I don't even think, is it about appealing to women or"
703.8,705.4, about appealing to me?
705.4,707.24," Because, well, yeah, I'm not that."
707.24,708.8399999999999, That's being like 14 year old.
708.8399999999999,709.24, Right.
709.24,709.64, Yeah.
709.64,711.88," That's actually a pin of in fact, that's totally,"
711.88,712.92, he wants more.
712.92,715.7199999999999, We want a woman with more to get off for chest than a wet t-shirt.
715.7199999999999,718.92," And like, she, she, she, she, she with the, on a fucking poll with 30"
718.92,720.52, hores blood.
720.52,721.9599999999999," I'm not doing that, man."
721.9599999999999,725.4," And also like, with GTA for, it's like the more you look to,"
725.4,728.1999999999999," the more you see like, wow, how old are you guys?"
728.1999999999999,730.52," I mean, I, I, I, I love this game a lot."
730.52,731.4, I'm really enjoying it.
731.4,733.4, But like there were things that I kept doing
733.4,735.72," that I didn't even, I wasn't even getting the joke at first."
735.72,740.1999999999999," Like the, the, uh, the internet cafe, the name."
740.1999999999999,741.0, Did you notice that?
741.0,741.8," Oh yeah, that's what?"
741.8,742.6, What?
742.6,744.6," Yeah, because it's TW and the at sign."
744.6,745.9599999999999," And I was just like, what's Twa?"
745.9599999999999,747.16, I'm trying to find the guy out.
747.16,748.4399999999999," It's like, out, geez."
748.4399999999999,750.92," Yeah, it is disappointing sometimes when they've gone to like such"
750.92,751.16, great.
751.16,753.0," CNT is the name of a,"
753.0,753.8, the regulations.
753.8,754.52, Yeah.
754.52,757.64, They go to like such great links to skewer American culture
757.64,760.84," and the best thing they can come up with to make fun of like the whole,"
760.9200000000001,765.8000000000001, like internet thing is using the at symbol to spell Twa.
765.8000000000001,766.6800000000001, That's what I'm saying.
766.6800000000001,770.12, Like there's points in the game where the humor is really sharp and funny.
770.12,770.52, Yeah.
770.52,774.6800000000001, And some of the cutscenes are outstanding and the character of Bruce is hilarious.
774.6800000000001,776.36," Yeah, that, that, that he's hilarious."
776.36,777.1600000000001, Bruce is killer.
777.1600000000001,778.36," Characters, they shouldn't have been funny."
778.36,781.24," And then of course, like the talk radio stations are great."
781.24,781.8000000000001, That's great.
781.8000000000001,782.44, That's a great idea.
782.44,785.96," And the thing about Bruce, he too, is you can tell how smart these guys are."
785.96,789.48," I mean, they're taking the guy who is completely, completely doesn't get it"
789.5600000000001,791.5600000000001," about his own sexuality, right?"
791.5600000000001,795.96," So this is, I mean, he's, he's, he just doesn't see it."
795.96,797.8000000000001," You know, he doesn't see what the rest of us see."
797.8000000000001,802.6," And so, you know, there's some writers on that staff who have some interesting,"
802.6,805.4," you know, who have thought through gender issues."
805.4,805.5600000000001, Yeah.
805.5600000000001,807.88," And then they go ahead and make Twa, and you're like, wow,"
807.88,809.64, way to go for the low hanging fruit.
809.64,809.96, Yeah.
809.96,813.08," You know, maybe it's the guys who are making the signs and stuff."
813.08,813.4, Yeah.
813.4,814.12, You have to say it.
814.12,814.28, Yeah.
814.28,814.6, Yeah.
814.6,815.4, Collaborative effort.
815.4,815.88, Yeah.
815.88,817.24, Not everyone.
817.64,820.52," The people who are writing Bruce, he are probably not writing the signs."
820.52,820.92, Yeah.
820.92,823.32," I mean, maybe they are, but doubtful."
823.32,823.72, doubtful.
823.72,825.32, And I'm not to be through that.
825.32,827.96," It's not to say, I mean, we're here at the podcast."
827.96,832.84," How, how much in the past 20 minutes we've been here have we made fart jokes?"
832.84,834.6," I mean, it's not like we're above this stuff."
834.6,840.2," It's just, it's just that no one's paying us to put it into a game that everyone is buying,"
840.2,840.84, like 10.
840.84,844.44," Like, they get, it gets it's more, it's easier to name the thing that they're like,"
844.44,849.0," they could have had the equivalent of like, demonious acts and that it's first cyber cafe"
849.0,851.8000000000001," when you walk in there, you know, and state there's just like one normal person there,"
851.8000000000001,853.72, but they could have had a lot of fun with what wasn't there.
854.2800000000001,854.6800000000001, Yeah.
854.6800000000001,854.9200000000001, Yeah.
854.9200000000001,858.7600000000001," And that could just be like, you know, it's been on time versus working in a production budget."
858.7600000000001,859.08, Yeah.
859.08,863.4000000000001," You just want to see him aim a little bit higher, given how smart they clearly are,"
863.4000000000001,868.2800000000001, and how funny they really are at and a lot of points in the game to just not go for the
869.24,870.6800000000001, eighth grade jokes.
870.6800000000001,871.8800000000001, Leave that to us.
871.8800000000001,872.9200000000001, We can do that.
872.92,873.64," Yeah, I'll tell you."
876.04,876.8399999999999," Yeah, that's something."
880.5999999999999,881.0, Sound.
881.0,881.4799999999999, Amen.
883.0799999999999,886.36," All right, have we figured out yet if he sang cane laughs or cane lives?"
886.36,888.4399999999999," I don't, it sounds like he's saying cane lofts."
888.4399999999999,889.4799999999999, I think he's doing it again.
889.4799999999999,891.8, I think he would have a mind of saying real day to the mic.
891.8,895.88, I think he's trying to sell some really over-priced condos in this dead market.
895.88,896.76, Here he goes.
899.7199999999999,900.76, It says laughs.
900.76,901.56, It's lofts.
903.0799999999999,904.28, You can't kill them as I say.
904.28,906.1999999999999," If he can live, then make sense."
906.1999999999999,907.3199999999999, He just can't kill him.
907.3199999999999,910.52," I think he says saying laughs, but he does sound lives makes more sense."
910.52,910.8399999999999, Yeah.
910.8399999999999,911.64," All right, let's do it."
911.64,912.76," But it's like, why is he laughing?"
913.56,914.5999999999999, And then he didn't even laugh.
914.5999999999999,915.4, And he's not even laughing.
915.4,916.04, He just laughed.
916.04,917.24," Well, that's how bad as he is."
917.24,918.28, He just does not say.
918.28,919.3199999999999, That's how he laughs.
920.28,921.16, I laugh.
921.16,922.76," It's like, he's a muse."
922.76,926.4399999999999," It's like, I know people who don't laugh."
926.4399999999999,927.4," They just say, lol."
928.28,928.92, That's that.
928.92,929.24, Yeah.
929.9599999999999,930.68," Yeah, lol."
930.68,931.88, That's what you're not really like.
932.84,936.12, I didn't want to announce like I've always had like pet peeves for like
936.12,941.16, played out language that comes from the YTM and D played out means super market.
941.16,946.68, And like the whole epic fail confirmed for the win.
946.68,949.4," All that stuff, I mean, I've kind of like"
949.4,951.88, just cranged when I've heard and seen that for the past.
951.88,953.0, I don't know how to have it long.
953.0,957.24," But it's official now because if you go to the EVGA site that the banner ad,"

975.24,977.24," Yeah, don't think we're hip if we say it."
977.24,978.6," Right, that's just part of being a kid too."
978.6,979.4, You got to go.
979.4,981.4," I mean, you get it's time to time to move on."
981.4,987.0," You know, being, uh, you make something else for EVGA to use as their next advertising."
987.0,989.08," Yeah, I get that at home with my own kids."
989.1600000000001,989.88, I'm the buff.

1023.88,1026.2," It's just, you know, they work it through together."
1027.0,1028.36, We have to start our own memes.
1029.08,1029.72, We do.
1029.72,1030.28, We try to.
1030.84,1031.32, Can't lie.
1031.32,1034.28, And that's the thing like when like when Waja hits critical mass then
1034.28,1036.36," not have to retire that, you know, that's just the way the world."
1036.36,1038.2, But I think that Waja isn't.
1038.68,1039.48, It's good for.
1040.2,1043.3999999999999, Waja has too many syllables and a weird spelling.
1043.3999999999999,1043.8, Yeah.
1043.8,1045.0, I see a lot of it.
1045.0,1046.12, It's not safe reds.
1046.4399999999998,1047.8, We're not even reference at all.
1047.8,1049.0, It makes me really happy.
1049.0,1051.1599999999999, Like some people I've seen it to see is a couple.
1051.1599999999999,1051.9599999999998, It is spreading.
1051.9599999999998,1052.4399999999998, Yeah.
1052.4399999999998,1053.2399999999998, It will.
1053.2399999999998,1053.8799999999999, I don't know.
1053.8799999999999,1056.04," It has a certain stickiness to it, but it's gotten."
1056.04,1056.28, Yeah.
1057.0,1060.6799999999998," It's nice to say not, not as nice to use on boards or something."
1060.6799999999998,1062.52, That's good to use in case.
1062.52,1063.32, We'll in.
1063.32,1064.04, I would like to see.
1064.04,1064.6799999999998, I like to use.
1064.6799999999998,1065.4799999999998, Because that's like.
1065.4799999999998,1067.08, So it's a reversal.
1067.08,1069.56, It's as universal as a part of this spell.
1069.56,1071.7199999999998, Someone can be a Schweeler that's wealed you.
1071.7199999999998,1073.1599999999999," Captain, Captain V."
1073.1599999999999,1074.76, They may have a Schweeler.
1075.24,1076.04, Oh.
1078.04,1078.92," Like,"
1078.92,1080.2," yeah, it's like,"
1080.2,1080.84, Smurf.
1082.84,1083.4, We'll.
1085.4,1087.48, That is low hanging through.
1087.48,1088.28, Yeah.
1088.28,1089.48, Such a Schweeler.
1089.48,1092.2, So let's get back to let's pick a picker topic here.
1092.2,1092.76," Like, oh yeah."
1092.76,1094.12, We can go back to GTA.
1094.12,1095.32," Yeah, let's go back to GTA."
1095.32,1095.96, I assume.
1095.96,1099.32," I mean, pretty much everyone in this room is playing except the Ryan or you playing."
1100.28,1101.4, I haven't started yet.
1101.4,1104.28, But I was reading some magazine that's like the pinnacle of
1104.36,1105.96, interactive entertainment.
1105.96,1106.44, Really?
1106.44,1108.44, Is that what you're reading there?
1108.44,1110.12, That's many magazines actually.
1110.12,1111.24, Pretty excited to play.
1111.24,1112.68, The pinnacle of interactive entertainment.
1112.68,1113.08," Yeah, right."
1113.08,1113.24, Right.
1113.24,1114.44, Finished farming my TF2.
1114.44,1114.92," Yeah, yeah."
1114.92,1115.72," Yeah, that's it."
1115.72,1118.52," If I made, this is not this is going to sound like a diversion."
1118.52,1120.36, But it isn't that promise.
1120.36,1122.44, But this guy set me a letter just today.
1123.48,1125.0, Don't let me get to off track with this.
1125.0,1127.3999999999999, But you'll understand why I'm reading this.
1127.3999999999999,1128.36," Hello, Jeff."
1128.36,1131.0, I have a tale to tell you and the GFW crew about.
1131.08,1134.2, I recently got scammed out of $600.
1134.2,1135.96, It was a Craigslist deal that went sour.
1135.96,1139.4, And now I am sad because this occurred the same day you guys announced the magazine
1139.4,1142.2, was closing down and that I would at least my favorite magazine.
1142.2,1143.64, Now to my question.
1143.64,1146.04, I know you guys love to go off topic on the podcast.
1146.04,1147.48, That's if you guys have a topic.
1149.24,1150.04," Fuck you, buddy."
1150.04,1152.12, But it's got scammed.
1152.12,1155.48," But have you guys ever felt that as game height builds up,"
1155.48,1158.12," that when you finally get your hands on it, you know doubt love it,"
1158.12,1160.52, but it becomes something of frustration.
1160.68,1163.16," You want to like it as much as these people talk about,"
1163.16,1165.96, but it's just not up to the level that you would put.
1165.96,1168.36, You would like it returning to the question.
1168.36,1171.4," Have you ever given a game the status of quote,"
1171.4,1173.6399999999999, putting the pussy on the pedestal?
1173.6399999999999,1174.44, Unquestion.
1174.44,1176.44, What?
1176.44,1177.24, What is that?
1177.24,1178.52, I don't know what to have you.
1178.52,1180.6, You get why I'm bringing up GK because he said that.
1180.6,1181.56, I didn't know what that phrase.
1181.56,1182.28, I had a comment on Smith.
1182.28,1184.28," But then he says, that's from one of his movies."
1184.28,1185.08, Oh is it?
1185.08,1185.96, I think maybe.
1185.96,1188.28, I mentioned this because a few months ago I played by a shock.
1188.28,1189.08," No, okay, me wrong."
1189.08,1192.44," It was amazing, but it was face, I was face of this pedestal effect."
1192.44,1194.04, Just wanted to get your opinion on this.
1194.04,1196.84," In case you're wondering, I lost some money on a PS3 and a iPhone."
1197.72,1198.36, If you want to.
1198.36,1199.8799999999999, I think it's something I just did.
1199.8799999999999,1200.84, This is ultimately a scam.
1201.6399999999999,1202.2, That is the end.
1202.2,1205.8799999999999," So thanks in part in the grammar, I'm sitting in class and not really proofreading."
1207.16,1208.28, What's that really loved?
1208.28,1209.24, I like.
1209.24,1214.2," Like, yeah, I've noticed with like, I agree with that in class."
1214.2,1215.8, Almost unique to gaming.
1215.8799999999999,1221.48," Whereas with like movie criticism or something, you'll have an audience that for the most part"
1221.48,1226.44," will be like receive things better than the critics do and they're concerned about it,"
1226.44,1229.24, disconnect about the leaders and the critics.
1229.24,1234.76," And with games, I mean, how weird is that that we've got the reverse where the so-called critics"
1234.76,1239.48," are the ones that are just going like, Abeshid and every, you know, like, I mean, here's"
1239.48,1240.84, part of this thing that Ryanland read.
1240.84,1244.84," I mean, this one intro has got every cliche you could think of, but it including and says"
1244.9199999999998,1248.6799999999998, you're completely rewrite the rule book that pushes the envelope.
1248.6799999999998,1251.32," It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but you know, it goes on something,"
1251.32,1254.04, the pinnacle of interactive entertainment game design.
1255.24,1257.32," I don't know though, but it's just this weird."
1257.32,1258.76, I don't know. I don't feel good about that.
1258.76,1262.12," The fact that it's not like critics are supposed to be snobs or something, but when you're"
1262.12,1267.08," audience though, is even was pickier than you and you're the one who's supposed to have all"
1267.08,1267.56, of them.
1267.56,1267.9599999999998, Right.
1267.9599999999998,1269.9599999999998," You know, the access to the game every time."
1269.9599999999998,1270.6, Right.
1270.6,1273.1599999999999, It was like going out of the way to like top the next one.
1273.16,1275.4, But it's not just the greatest game of all time.
1276.44,1278.1200000000001, So great game that will ever be ever yet.
1279.16,1281.96," I mean, if there's games another universe is there not better than this one."
1283.4,1289.3200000000002, There's like a lack of subtlety when when people do get their hands on a game that is really good.
1289.3200000000002,1292.68, It's like no ability to stop it.
1292.68,1297.24, This is a really interesting game that's really worth 80 hours of your time.
1297.24,1300.8400000000001, You can't just stop there. You got to say this really changed my life.
1301.8,1308.52," You know, this gave me an uncontrollable Viagra hard on for two days."
1309.24,1311.8," You have to, I mean, it's just over time."
1311.8,1313.72, Like no one's able to take some subtlety instead.
1313.72,1318.84," It becomes like, if they're going to introduce any criticism at all, it's like this kind of like back and forth."
1318.84,1321.6399999999999," Well, it's the greatest thing ever, but it's not perfect."
1321.6399999999999,1323.6399999999999, The frame rates do appear in there.
1323.6399999999999,1326.9199999999998, There was a coin-to-beating mechanic is kind of clunky.
1326.9199999999998,1327.32, Right.
1327.3999999999999,1331.72, It just points to like just this lack of vocabulary for this for what we do.
1331.72,1333.72, There's not enough things to latch on to.
1334.6799999999998,1339.8," Or to discuss the, you just most people just tend to go straight for the ones they know."
1339.8,1341.3999999999999," And it's just like, it's life-changing."
1341.3999999999999,1344.28," Yeah, I mean, this game is really, really good."
1344.28,1348.76, It's really good. I've played on the second island now.
1348.76,1354.12, I think I've just hit something like 30-something percent of the total story.
1354.12,1358.52, But I've heard now that you can finish it story-wise in the like 70 areas.
1358.52,1361.08, So I think I've made decent progress.
1361.6399999999999,1363.9599999999998, And I'm liking it more as I keep playing it.
1363.9599999999998,1366.4399999999998, So I think it's good. But that's the thing.
1368.28,1369.9599999999998," I like, I should be able to criticize it."
1369.9599999999998,1371.32, It's not perspective.
1371.32,1373.1599999999999, Right. And not feel like.
1373.1599999999999,1378.52," I think also, you're getting this trap where, when you're so eager to say these things about it,"
1378.52,1382.6," and you're also trying to like, I mean, even if it's unconsciously trying to"
1383.56,1386.84," out, I don't know, out-bona the next guy."
1386.84,1389.8, We're going to get the degree of your career.
1389.8,1390.6799999999998, Yeah.
1390.6799999999998,1393.1599999999999," You start like, you know, one thing I ask Shane about."
1393.1599999999999,1395.1599999999999," He used the expression, you know, a living breathing world."
1395.1599999999999,1396.6," And it's like, you hear that in every context."
1396.6,1398.1999999999998," And it's like, in this thing I'm looking at right now."
1398.1999999999998,1399.56, There it is in the captions. There it is.
1399.56,1402.1999999999998," And I was like, well, let's think about the limits of that."
1402.1999999999998,1404.1999999999998, And that means really easy to just repeat that.
1404.1999999999998,1404.6, Mm-hmm.
1404.6,1409.3999999999999," But maybe like, we might learn a little bit about our expectations in the game itself."
1409.48,1411.96," If we at least challenge it, not to say it's wrong."
1411.96,1414.44," But like, let's, let's, what, why are we getting this from it?"
1414.44,1415.5600000000002," I mean, we're the limitations of it."
1415.5600000000002,1417.8000000000002, But everyone just goes in and has the same points.
1417.8000000000002,1421.5600000000002," And it's like, this is the, this game that lets you do anything you want."
1421.5600000000002,1425.48," And it's all about, you know, player, you know, choice and inventiveness and stuff."
1425.48,1426.6000000000001, And then I'm playing in half a time.
1426.6000000000001,1432.44," I'm like, it's upsetting me because it's deliberately, you know, preventing me from,"
1432.44,1435.5600000000002," from getting any satisfaction, from attempting to improvise my own solution."
1435.5600000000002,1437.88," So for, you know, give you, you want to get three examples in a row,"
1437.88,1440.68," because this was the case of like, I really didn't feel like I was nitpicking."
1440.68,1443.0800000000002," Again, these don't ruin the game for me, but they disappointed me."
1443.0800000000002,1447.0," Um, it was like, so I'm not like, I'm not desperate to find this bill."
1447.0,1449.5600000000002, Just since these three missions came one after the other.
1449.5600000000002,1451.64, And every time I was dorted in some way.
1451.64,1454.7600000000002," So the first one you're supposed to get a guy in a laundry mat, he gets spooked."
1454.7600000000002,1455.88, He goes out the back.
1455.88,1457.0800000000002, So I failed the first time.
1457.0800000000002,1458.68," I was like, all right, I'm going to go around the back."
1458.68,1460.7600000000002," I'm going to shoot his vehicle, tires out."
1460.7600000000002,1461.48, That spooked him.
1461.48,1462.1200000000001, So I can do that.
1462.1200000000001,1467.16," But then what I was able to do is quietly park in the whole shit look, cars and block it."
1467.3200000000002,1468.92, Block his vehicle in back there.
1468.92,1470.1200000000001, And it's my idea.
1470.1200000000001,1471.72, So he go around to chase him.
1471.72,1472.68, And then I go get him.
1472.68,1474.76," And as soon as we come out the back door, all that was undone."
1474.76,1475.8000000000002," You know, it was just gone."
1475.8000000000002,1476.28, Uh-huh.
1476.28,1482.0400000000002," Um, and then likewise, when I go around the back to try to snipe his tires on this car, it says he's"
1482.0400000000002,1483.72," escaped out the front, but you go out the front."
1483.72,1485.0, He's not really there.
1485.0,1487.3200000000002, You can't beat the mission that way by chasing out the front door.
1487.3200000000002,1489.24," The next one, I'm chasing a guy."
1489.24,1491.88," And he eventually goes to a construction site, right?"
1491.88,1493.48, He's climbing ladders and he's supposed to get chasing.
1493.48,1496.76," So the whole time he's climbing, I'm shooting him, unloading clip after clipping him."
1496.76,1498.36, I'd go up a ladder.
1498.36,1499.56, Nothing's hurting this guy.
1499.56,1503.32," And of course, you can't kill him because what the game wants you to do is see that he falls"
1503.32,1505.72, over the ledge and his panic and fear running from you.
1505.72,1507.48, And then you stomp on his hands so he falls.
1507.48,1509.0," It's like, or does it?"
1509.0,1510.52, I think climatic already hit this one.
1510.52,1511.0," Not, of course."
1511.0,1512.2, You can save him.
1512.2,1514.04, So it was building to that.
1514.04,1514.84, That was one of them.
1514.84,1516.92," But it was building, but your point is the same."
1516.92,1519.0, Although they need to get to have that scene.
1519.0,1522.76," Now you could, I might have done that differently because I think I just shot that guy in the"
1522.76,1523.8799999999999, head and he fell off.
1523.88,1527.5600000000002," I couldn't, I couldn't, you can't kill him until you get to the point because they want you"
1527.5600000000002,1528.5200000000002, to make that scene choice.
1528.5200000000002,1529.3200000000002, Where you have the choice?
1529.3200000000002,1530.5200000000002," Oh, maybe it's further down."
1530.5200000000002,1532.5200000000002, How many flickers is it?
1532.5200000000002,1533.5200000000002, This is very early.
1533.5200000000002,1534.5200000000002, It's pretty early.
1534.5200000000002,1538.1200000000001," I never, I never made that choice and I'm thinking."
1538.1200000000001,1539.0, I didn't even know what was there.
1539.0,1541.88, That's why I said stomp his hand because I was just matching the button at that point because
1541.88,1542.88, I was mad.
1542.88,1543.88, So did you not get a cutscene?
1543.88,1544.88, I've decided to kill this guy.
1544.88,1545.88, I didn't get a cutscene.
1545.88,1546.88, I didn't get a cutscene.
1546.88,1549.96," It makes a point of saying like, no, you have a choice player."
1549.96,1550.96, It's blue or red.
1550.96,1551.96, You choose blue or red.
1551.96,1553.24," I've never, I really know."
1553.24,1555.32," I just, I just killed that guy like straight out."
1555.32,1556.32, I'm pretty sure.
1556.32,1558.32," Well, maybe this is just saying that there's another way then."
1558.32,1559.32," Anyway, but not all the way."
1559.32,1561.32, The chance to reach the distance.
1561.32,1562.32, Yeah.
1562.32,1567.32, And then the third one is like you're going to kill this guy who's dating the character
1567.32,1568.32, Faustian's daughter.
1568.32,1569.32, Yeah.
1569.32,1572.92, And he's on this bike and it takes the opportunity to explain you that you can fire gun
1572.92,1573.92, on the bike.
1573.92,1574.28," So I'm like, OK, great."
1574.28,1575.28, Let's shoot this guy.
1575.28,1576.44," Again, you fire that guy."
1576.44,1578.48, You can ram him off his bike.
1578.48,1579.68, But he'll just get back on you.
1579.68,1582.84," Can't kill him until again, it gets to the cutscene that it wants you to see where"
1582.84,1585.6, he meets up with his other bike or gang and you fight them in a park.
1585.6,1587.8," So the whole time, you can just hit him over and over again."
1587.8,1590.04," Shoot his tires, you can't, you can't hurt him."
1590.04,1594.12," So it's like, when you're going to go and have these, you know, I mean,"
1594.12,1596.8799999999999," go ahead and respond, Robert, give you a, I was saying,"
1596.8799999999999,1598.32, I'm going to say what I'm responding to.
1598.32,1602.8799999999999, I've found like a lot of inconsistency in what you can and can't do in the game
1602.8799999999999,1608.08," because you were talking about, you know, your idea of like parking cars to stop"
1608.08,1609.8799999999999, that guy from leaving the laundry mat.
1610.1200000000001,1614.48, I've also done that and I've had it have like work half the time and not work half
1614.48,1614.8000000000002, the time.
1614.8000000000002,1619.8000000000002," There's another, there's a really difficult mission with the Dwayne character"
1619.8000000000002,1626.3600000000001, about 20% or 25% into the game that where you have to go take back a strip club
1626.3600000000001,1629.48, for him and it's like these three strip club managers in there.
1629.48,1632.88," And it's it's pretty, I had a hard time with it because there's no, not a lot of places"
1632.88,1637.2800000000002, for cover and one guy darts out really early on and you got to go like run them down
1637.28,1640.04, and usually the police show up so it's like a total cluster fuck.
1640.04,1645.0," Well, I decided to park a car against the back door so that you can't leave."
1645.0,1647.08," The first time I tried it, the car disappeared."
1647.08,1650.68," Yeah, the second time I tried it, I used two cars and they stayed."
1650.68,1651.68," Like, weird."
1651.68,1655.68," Yeah, and so he couldn't leave and he had to go out the front door and I could keep it."
1655.68,1660.28, My guess was that the technical limitation that specifically provides that kind of scenario
1660.28,1662.6, most cases because it's like the game doesn't remember.
1662.6,1665.72," I mean, if you remember previous GTA, sometimes when you turn around behind you,"
1665.72,1667.04, the world had been reset.
1667.1599999999999,1672.32," Yeah, like I mean, so like when you go and view the cutting, it's like it reloads that or something."
1672.32,1674.36," It resets it to this like, yeah, that's what I said."
1674.36,1675.36, The fast days.
1675.36,1679.92," Yeah, script was taken over at that point, which is why, you know,"
1680.04,1682.44, which is why things like the cars disappearing.
1682.92,1687.44," That it is, it's just starting that mission at a specific zero state."
1687.6399999999999,1689.6," So those, I mean, those things aren't bad, right?"
1689.6,1690.6399999999999," I mean, no, they're not bad."
1690.6399999999999,1693.32," I'm not like, no, but they're a different kind of game than one being described."
1693.32,1693.92, Exactly.
1693.92,1694.96, And that's my point.
1694.96,1697.92," And then it's like, if you think then what's going to happen just a year after year,"
1697.92,1700.16, then they'll get to the point where those things are addressed.
1700.16,1702.0800000000002," And it's like, you're just going to keep writing about how it's,"
1702.0800000000002,1706.16, but you already said that it led you do everything you could have ever imagined yourself ever doing.
1706.16,1706.8000000000002, Right.
1706.8000000000002,1707.0, Right.
1707.0,1708.76, I think that's what we're all objecting to here.
1708.76,1710.96," It was like, this game does not do everything."
1710.96,1712.1200000000001, It is not perfect.
1712.1200000000001,1714.44," There's, there's holes left and right."
1714.44,1717.04, That doesn't mean it's not an amazing achievement.
1717.04,1718.4, I think it is.
1718.4,1721.92, I think some of the writing is fantastic.
1721.92,1726.72," I mean, like I said, some of the characterization is great."
1726.72,1728.28, Definitely of all the GTAs.
1728.28,1733.52, And I put them all since two.
1733.52,1734.3600000000001, I don't know what's attached.
1734.3600000000001,1736.88," I didn't play, what was the first non-top down one?"
1736.88,1737.88," Three, three, three."
1737.88,1738.24, OK.
1738.24,1742.92, So that's what I played that and vice-city and San Andreas.
1742.92,1747.16, And I think this is the first one where the story itself has kept me going.
1747.16,1749.3600000000001, I really want to see what happens to Nico.
1749.4399999999998,1753.4799999999998, And I think the voice acting of that guy and some of the others are great.
1753.4799999999998,1756.8," I had like, there's this other sideline discussion."
1756.8,1760.56," It's about how, like, well, this one's so much different because the story so different,"
1760.56,1761.56, the character's so different.
1761.56,1763.52, And I kind of want to know where you guys stand on it.
1763.52,1766.9599999999998," For me, the character is like, really fits in."
1766.9599999999998,1771.6, He fits in the theme that this has been true for all of the previous characters.
1771.6,1774.6," I mean, he's like an outsider in some way, shape, or form."
1774.6,1776.28," You know, if you look at the other guys, I mean, that's this."
1776.28,1777.96, He's often played a part in that.
1777.96,1782.52," I mean, occupy his more or less the same position in American society and move through it"
1782.52,1789.28, in exactly the same way as he's just like two to mentionly concerned with this like loyalty-based
1789.28,1792.52, ethics and all these things like that.
1792.52,1793.52," I mean, that's the richness."
1793.52,1794.52, Right.
1794.52,1795.52, Yeah.
1795.52,1796.52, So he's been very similar for me.
1796.52,1799.52," The problem I've had, this is like, I had this change in my take on the game."
1799.52,1802.24," At first, when I was playing, it was like, I was really feeling the characters."
1802.24,1805.84," I was like, OK, I can feel this guy."
1805.84,1809.9199999999998," And it kind of made me not want to just randomly, like, don't just want to really drive"
1809.9199999999998,1812.08, through crowds on the sidewalk and stuff.
1812.08,1813.3999999999999, Because it seemed out of character.
1813.3999999999999,1816.72," This guy is like willing to murder, but he's not a social path."
1816.72,1817.9599999999998, So I wouldn't do that.
1817.9599999999998,1821.32," And that was like talking about how the consequence, you know, I want to be here."
1821.32,1824.1599999999999," So I was talking about how the consequence for me is that the game, when you play it in"
1824.1599999999999,1829.6399999999999," the way that a lot of people cite liking to play these games, just randomly going around"
1829.6399999999999,1831.9599999999998," and shooting stuff and blowing stuff up, it's not as fun to me."
1831.9599999999998,1835.8," And part because of that, because it seems as soon as I do that act, it at the, at the"
1835.8799999999999,1839.6," time, it was like, I've crossed the line and now I'm playing like another game, a mini"
1839.6,1841.84, game or another mode or something.
1841.84,1844.56," And the game of the game, it breaks character."
1844.56,1845.56," Yeah, much I thought."
1845.56,1849.28," And then games like Crackdown and stuff, since they've done, I think they've done that"
1849.28,1850.28, better.
1850.28,1853.6399999999999," There's still randomly running around and causing mayhem and stuff, so they've done that"
1853.6399999999999,1854.6399999999999, better.
1854.6399999999999,1855.6399999999999, That was less fun with me.
1855.6399999999999,1858.9199999999998," But then, as I kept playing, now I've done a number of missions."
1858.9199999999998,1862.56, And I start seeing just these pretty gross inconsistencies and the characters ethics.
1862.56,1868.32," And then, just his is just willingness to do anything without any questions or whatever."
1868.32,1872.28," I mean, and even though there's always loyalty as playing as the justification, the way that"
1872.28,1874.3999999999999," it's shifting between, like, what is he loyal to?"
1874.3999999999999,1879.08," It was just so paper thin and I was like, this guy is a sociopath now."
1879.08,1880.8," And then after that, like, snapped, it was weird."
1880.8,1884.08," Now I just casually, if I'm driving to pick up a date, I'll just drive through like 20"
1884.08,1888.6399999999999, people in the curb and then take the date to dinner and shoot everyone in the restaurant
1888.6399999999999,1891.08," and get back out and it's like, now it's like, it just seems fine."
1891.08,1892.6399999999999," There's this guy, there's nothing to him."
1892.6399999999999,1893.6399999999999, He's just a sociopath.
1893.6399999999999,1896.6399999999999," Well, then the date will still say, like, are you involved in crime?"
1896.6399999999999,1898.6399999999999," Yeah, I love what she asked."
1898.6399999999999,1901.6399999999999," And she's asking that whole thing about, like, my contacts."
1901.6399999999999,1904.6399999999999," I was like, well, you just ran over that whole thing."
1904.6399999999999,1908.84," Well, I think that's actually the best interesting thing about the game."
1908.84,1914.9199999999998, And I think that I haven't really seen many people discuss is that I really feel like this
1914.92,1922.64, particular game pushes the conflict between story and open choice in games more than
1922.64,1924.16, anything I've ever seen.
1924.16,1927.68," It's like, it is so, uh, skits of frenic."
1927.68,1928.68, Yeah.
1928.68,1929.68, And so far.
1929.68,1930.68, Yeah.
1930.68,1931.68, Yeah.
1931.68,1932.68, Yeah.
1932.68,1933.68, Yeah.
1933.68,1936.52, There's a boundary that is not technical in these kinds of games.
1936.52,1940.4, It's an artistic one where people can't figure out how they're going to make
1940.4,1944.88," players, uh, be able to do whatever they want in the world, but still have them play a"
1944.88,1946.76, believable character that you care about.
1946.76,1950.3600000000001," And in those missions with Michelle, not Missions dates, right?"
1950.3600000000001,1951.3600000000001, Right.
1951.3600000000001,1953.3600000000001, Hang it out with her and you're getting a nowhere and you're telling her all these things
1953.3600000000001,1954.3600000000001, about yourself.
1954.3600000000001,1958.8400000000001," I specifically remember the first time I accidentally, you know, you know, had, I've"
1958.8400000000001,1960.72, lost my car and I had to steal a car.
1960.72,1964.88, And she's like having this really intense conversation with me about things.
1964.88,1966.52, And I'm carjack and things.
1966.52,1967.52, Right.
1967.52,1968.52, And she's not noticing it.
1968.52,1969.52, It's really like broke.
1969.52,1970.52, Yeah.
1970.52,1972.52, Thank you for for me for me.
1972.52,1976.08," And, you know, and, but I mean, like I said, it's not, I don't know how you do it better."
1976.08,1978.28, It's like it's a serious game design problem.
1978.28,1982.56," Like that people are going to face for for a long time, like figuring out how you have"
1982.56,1986.36, any sort of choice in a world that is so specific to me.
1986.36,1987.36, It's a big obstacle.
1987.36,1991.8799999999999, It might be a problem of just like how much time do you have to implement all the
1991.8799999999999,1994.76," many, many possibilities when you really want to have this overall."
1994.76,1999.12," Like they could have had Michelle, you know, freak out and never want to date you again."
1999.12,2003.12," And that to me is one option that might have been on the table, but probably tossed aside"
2003.12,2004.12, for time or something.
2004.12,2005.12, Cost effective.
2005.12,2009.0," Yeah, you're eating a bandwidth, so to speak, for every contingency that you anticipate."
2009.0,2010.0, Yeah.
2010.0,2012.56," You know, so you're like, okay, we're going to have to record extra dialogue for when the"
2012.56,2014.04, player does this.
2014.04,2017.4, We're going to have to put something into the system that can account for this action.
2017.4,2020.8799999999999," And then you say, well, if we did it for this action, then you get to that thing with,"
2020.8799999999999,2023.28," like, visual fidelity and physics fidelity, right?"
2023.28,2025.16, Or you have an instructable environment.
2025.16,2029.68," And if you have like 20 things, just blow up real nice, then it's like 21st thing that doesn't"
2029.68,2030.68, blow up.
2030.68,2031.68, It's going to stand out.
2031.68,2033.48," So it's like, then you get in this trap where it's like, well, we did this and this,"
2033.48,2035.3999999999999, there's always going to be something you can't account for.
2035.3999999999999,2039.6," And they just have to, like, right now, limitations both for programming, just for memory,"
2039.6,2040.6, but also for budget.
2040.6,2045.76," I mean, I think this game fits in the like uncanny valley of gameplay in a way, because"
2045.76,2049.16, like the closure gets to reality the more you notice the breaking of it.
2049.16,2050.84," So it just, yeah."
2050.92,2057.1600000000003," I also think they go for like a more traditional like huge long story line, you know,"
2057.1600000000003,2061.8," like a 40 hour, however long it is, story line where you meet a lot of people and a lot"
2061.8,2062.8, of things happen.
2062.8,2067.88, They've done a lot in the game to make the visual fidelity come across and be really realistic.
2067.88,2072.6000000000004," But I feel like in choosing to make this really long story that they've, they watered"
2072.6000000000004,2073.76," down, but could have been cooler."
2073.76,2078.44," Like I would rather play a game that the story part of it, like why not grant that"
2078.44,2082.52," out of story part of it six hours long, but a million different possibilities."
2082.52,2083.52, Yeah.
2083.52,2084.88," Like if you fuck with Michelle, it's over."
2084.88,2085.88, Right.
2085.88,2088.7200000000003," They clearly seemed, you know, they're at the end of this time, seem to be they wanted"
2088.7200000000003,2089.7200000000003, to tell this epic story.
2089.7200000000003,2092.7200000000003," You're playing a way to fight with the, what was that?"
2092.7200000000003,2093.7200000000003," You're playing way at the same, right?"
2093.7200000000003,2094.7200000000003," No, no, no."
2094.7200000000003,2095.7200000000003," That was, I loved playing."
2095.7200000000003,2096.7200000000003, That was the game.
2096.7200000000003,2098.96," It was two hours and length, exactly."
2098.96,2104.8," But like it did have all of that kind of stuff simulated, at least to a greater degree"
2104.8,2108.88," than like, grant that thought it could like you could totally, depending on how you interact"
2108.88,2112.7200000000003," with almost every character that was, you know, part of the plot, it would get a completely"
2112.7200000000003,2113.7200000000003, different outcome.
2113.7200000000003,2114.7200000000003, But it was only two hours.
2114.7200000000003,2118.5600000000004," It was a really compact, like short story that you kind of played over and over again."
2118.5600000000004,2119.5600000000004, Yeah.
2119.5600000000004,2120.5600000000004, So it's doable.
2120.5600000000004,2122.6400000000003, Just a matter of production costs that you're talking about.
2122.6400000000003,2126.7200000000003, I would love to play something like that like a rosharmon video game where you just get
2126.7200000000003,2128.36, a bunch of different outcomes.
2128.36,2130.36, If that's what we had a different thing.
2130.36,2131.36, Yeah.
2131.36,2132.36, That's pulling from.
2132.36,2136.6400000000003," But yeah, I mean, and a grant that thought it would be so cool for that because you have"
2136.6400000000003,2138.6, this huge city to fall back on.
2138.6,2141.4, It's not like you would have to just do that same thing all the time.
2141.4,2142.4, It wouldn't be so repetitive.
2142.4,2144.1200000000003, Probably finish it too.
2144.1200000000003,2147.52," Because now when I hear these estimates of a hundred hours, I know there's no way I'm"
2147.52,2148.88, going to finish this game.
2148.88,2151.28, It's just not going to hold my interest at all.
2151.28,2157.6400000000003," Well, I think too that the openness that in limiting it, like I think that they, like"
2157.6400000000003,2162.32, that's where I think you're getting some player disappointment too or some of the
2162.4,2167.6400000000003," early backlash to the reviews, which I totally agree were over the top."
2167.6400000000003,2172.48," But you know, you go into GTA4 in the first few hours."
2172.48,2175.0800000000004," You're, that's really a funneled experience."
2175.0800000000004,2176.7200000000003," Yeah, surprisingly so."
2176.7200000000003,2178.88," You know, I think surprisingly not interactive."
2178.88,2179.88, Yeah.
2179.88,2185.0, It's cutscenes like with a radio play in the form of you driving to the next cutscene.
2185.0,2186.92, And there's kind of like nothing open yet.
2186.92,2189.6400000000003, There's nothing to drive around too.
2189.6400000000003,2191.4, I guess you can't look.
2191.4,2194.0, But you haven't opened up any stores or I don't know.
2194.0,2198.1600000000003," I just remember in the other ones, it felt like you had access to the world itself at"
2198.1600000000003,2199.64, an earlier point.
2199.64,2203.1600000000003, Here they're really just making you set to the story for a long time.
2203.1600000000003,2206.6, Although it would be really hard to just wander around and have access because I feel
2206.6,2210.08," like now that the world, the, the fidelity of the world is up."
2210.08,2213.8, It's really hard to pick out where the points of interactivity are.
2213.8,2217.56, It's like I remember the first time I was going around trying to fill my health by looking
2217.56,2218.56, for a restaurant.
2218.56,2220.64," I kept on getting out of the car and like trying, oh, there's a diner."
2220.72,2221.64," Oh, wait."
2221.64,2222.64, I know that's not really a diner.
2222.64,2223.64, Yeah.
2223.64,2224.64, Yeah.
2224.64,2227.24," There are only a few places that you can really, and I know that that's just it."
2227.24,2231.24, You can't just like fill this world with real stores and stuff.
2231.24,2232.24, That's right.
2232.24,2236.72," Registly expensive, but it's just one of the things that they're obviously going to always"
2236.72,2237.72, be struggling with.
2237.72,2242.0," Well, that's the challenge that the Sims 3 designers are dealing with now."
2242.0,2247.8799999999997," When Sean and I went to visit them, you know, that's the whole premise of Sims 3 is that"
2247.88,2253.1600000000003, the town is living at the same time that your same is living and that when you walk outside
2253.1600000000003,2259.08," of your house in the Sims, there's a world at there, just like in GTA, but here, all the"
2259.08,2264.2000000000003, characters in the game are really real and going through a life cycle and the buildings
2264.2000000000003,2269.8," are real too and they had the faceless idea of like, well, if you go downtown in Sims 3"
2269.8,2274.32, are half the buildings just going to be like these fake store fronts or are they all going
2274.32,2279.04," to be places that you can go in an interact with, you know, and they're like trying"
2279.04,2284.6800000000003, to determine the size of the game based on that idea because of the suspension disbelief
2284.6800000000003,2286.4, that it messes with.
2286.4,2290.96," Yeah, just size alone obviously is like not a selling point."
2290.96,2294.6400000000003," I mean, I think that's just seem to have learned that a while ago because I remember"
2294.6400000000003,2299.04," a daggerfall, both didn't, you know, how many cities, like thousands of thousands of cities"
2299.04,2300.04, did visit?
2300.36,2306.2799999999997," They were all randomly generated, like, like, you could figure out what words they had"
2306.2799999999997,2310.44," two words, the first word of the bar and the second word of the bar and they just chuffled"
2310.44,2311.44, them.
2311.44,2315.64," So just like, oh, it's the golden monkey and then somewhere else you might find, you know,"
2315.64,2320.56, pestulent monkey and the same drunk and the same stool at the same and every bar.
2320.56,2326.72," Yeah, it's so different than the traveler and the problem with it of course was it was"
2326.72,2330.4399999999996," so not compelling, you didn't want to go to any of these 2000 cities."
2330.4399999999996,2331.4399999999996, Right.
2331.4399999999996,2335.9599999999996," Whereas every local in GTA 4, you know, quarantine is a different, yeah."
2335.9599999999996,2339.9199999999996," Like, sorry, I keep one of my headphones keeps going in and out the whole time we're"
2339.9199999999996,2340.9199999999996, typing.
2340.9199999999996,2346.12," I still actually it's actually you're hearing, you know, but each bit of it's got like"
2346.12,2347.72," a different feel, it's got character to it."
2347.72,2351.64, You don't feel like you're just going through like a reshuffling of the textures and assets
2351.64,2354.72, and geometry that they've already produced.
2354.72,2359.72, But on all the other part of my reaction to it is that I didn't have when I'm reading
2359.72,2365.4399999999996," these reviews and stuff, they're all saying, like, you know, 10 and if this guy went higher,"
2365.4399999999996,2366.4399999999996, we'd go higher.
2366.4399999999996,2370.2," A or in the case that we have a pause, you know, and for me, I'm comparing it to the way"
2370.2,2375.04," I felt when I played Super Mario Galaxy, Resident Evil 4, a bio-shock and portal and all"
2375.04,2378.2," these other games that I like recently come out that I've been who was really, really"
2378.2,2382.3599999999997," into where the entire time I'm thinking like, dude, I don't want to put this down."
2382.36,2383.84, This is just so good.
2383.84,2385.56, And I just don't get that feeling from it.
2385.56,2389.48," Sometimes it comes close, but it's like consistently, it's definitely not that way for"
2389.48,2390.48, me.
2390.48,2391.48, And this is a subjective thing.
2391.48,2396.44," But yeah, I actually, I mean, I've played 25 hours in the last seven days."
2396.44,2398.44, I was pretty crazy about that.
2398.44,2399.44, That means you're sprung.
2399.44,2400.44, Yeah.
2400.44,2401.44, Yeah.
2401.44,2402.44," I actually, but I didn't play last night."
2402.44,2403.44, I turned it on.
2403.44,2405.28," I was like, I can't do this tonight."
2405.28,2409.32," But yeah, I've been really into it and I've enjoyed it on that level."
2409.32,2410.32, I think.
2411.28,2415.92," Yeah, I would, I was just mainly looking for more interesting conversation about the"
2415.92,2416.92, game.
2416.92,2421.1200000000003," Like, I was surprised to meet the reflects, the way that people had to play the game to"
2421.1200000000003,2422.1200000000003, review it.
2422.1200000000003,2425.56," I mean, the, the, most people playing it in hotel rooms and stuff."
2425.56,2426.56, Yeah.
2426.56,2427.96, You'll stop home syndrome.
2427.96,2428.96, Right.
2428.96,2430.56, And a lot of them are coming at it too.
2430.56,2433.56," I mean, especially for the, this is interesting because I got crawled on this"
2433.56,2436.92," level up blog, just put a story up kind of like asking the same thing."
2436.92,2440.6, But he was calling the non-intrusious reviewers to task for it.
2440.6,2443.56, And it doesn't actually want entry.
2443.56,2447.32," And, but for us in the case of it looking at the enthusiasts' press, there's just"
2447.32,2451.48," back to that old notion that like, if you understand your job is telling people to buy"
2451.48,2454.44," something or not to buy it, you get this problem again."
2454.44,2455.84," You know, I don't want to keep picking on this one."
2455.84,2456.96, It's just the one that we have here.
2456.96,2459.8," But it's like if it starts off and it's saying, you know, go buy this game."
2459.8,2462.64," I mean, this stuff had, and, you know,"
2462.64,2466.3599999999997," um, whoever's that other."
2466.3599999999997,2471.04, You need to go buy it right away.
2471.04,2473.56," Trust us, you won't be disappointed or you've already pre-ordered it."
2473.56,2474.56, That kind of thing.
2474.56,2476.2," It's like, well, I mean, well, okay."
2476.2,2480.0," If you're magazine, if your point is to direct people to buy or not, you're"
2480.0,2482.68, already acknowledging that everyone knew to buy it in the first place.
2482.68,2485.56," Well, then why you have a review if you're not going to do something else."
2485.56,2487.0, If you're not going to engage in some real.
2487.0,2488.0, Right.
2488.0,2491.8799999999997," I mean, this goes back to, you know, why, you know, why people read reviews fundamentally."
2491.96,2497.12," Like, you know, I often won't read reviews until I've played mostly this is with"
2497.12,2498.12, movies and stuff though.
2498.12,2500.92," Like, till I've seen a movie, then I might go back and see what the conversation"
2500.92,2501.92, then.
2501.92,2504.76," And just kind of have, you know, the mental conversation with their critics over"
2504.76,2506.96, something I already experienced myself.
2506.96,2507.96, Yeah.
2507.96,2508.96, Right.
2508.96,2511.52," And most decent reviewers aren't just going to say, you know, go see this movie."
2511.52,2512.52, Right.
2512.52,2513.52, Exactly.
2513.52,2515.52," And yeah, if I did, I would never read it again because they're like, well, I saw it."
2515.52,2517.92, That's what I do have to what I saw.
2518.0,2521.84," But would there have people aren't, you know, also buckling under the task of having"
2521.84,2528.96," to review a game in the way that the, that the hardcore gamers and enthusiasts expect to"
2528.96,2534.08," have a game review for a grand theft auto, you know, they want to know about every facet"
2534.08,2535.6800000000003, of the game and how it works.
2535.6800000000003,2539.52," Like, they want you to like explain the game of baseball to them before you tell them how"
2539.52,2540.52, the game went down.
2540.52,2545.76," And like, that can be really a hindrance to having any sort of real interesting like conversation"
2545.76,2549.6800000000003," or review if you've got to go through and be like, well, the shooting mechanics better,"
2549.6800000000003,2551.0, but it's not as good.
2551.0,2552.0," Right, frame rates."
2552.0,2555.2000000000003," And it's just, if you had to have like a genealogical trade, you're going to talk about,"
2555.2000000000003,2558.8," like, on a carnina or something before you can, again, you're review, you know, you had"
2558.8,2560.76," to go through the entire, right?"
2560.76,2561.76, Yeah.
2561.76,2563.36," I mean, so that is a burden."
2563.36,2566.4," In the case of enthusiasts pressed, I really don't think you need to do that."
2566.4,2567.4, People don't need to know.
2567.4,2572.4," They, they now your audience knows pretty well how these games function."
2572.4,2574.76, And you can talk about the differences if that's what you're about.
2574.76,2578.36," Like to the point, they still, nonetheless, you'll see just paragraphs and paragraphs"
2578.36,2581.5600000000004, devoted at what specifically happens when you press each button.
2581.5600000000004,2585.48," And all this information, of course, is available on the press really sites for these,"
2585.48,2586.48, these games.
2586.48,2590.36," I mean, if you really want to know, you know, like what happens when you hit the left"
2590.36,2592.88," bumper, then I mean, that information's available and stuff."
2592.88,2594.7200000000003, And I think there's a few things.
2594.7200000000003,2601.28," I mean, for what it's challenging, you know, it's, it's a lot harder to write a real, you"
2601.28,2605.4," know, a substantial critique, evaluation of something and with some, you know, working"
2605.4,2609.6000000000004, out a thesis and ideas that you want to string of ideas that you want to develop as
2609.6000000000004,2614.2400000000002, you go through and running that idea track parallel to discussion of elements in the game
2614.2400000000002,2616.88, and having it all just sync up and going somewhere with it.
2616.88,2620.28, That takes a lot more work than just like if you got a looming deadline and you're looking
2620.28,2625.1600000000003, for every available shortcut known to people that are employed this way.
2625.1600000000003,2630.8, And maybe not everybody or maybe not the site you work for or whoever wants that.
2630.8,2631.8, And then that kind of review.
2631.8,2632.8, Yeah.
2632.8,2637.6000000000004," You know, and meanwhile, the audience really is just wanting to click on whatever the earliest"
2637.6000000000004,2639.0800000000004, review that's what I'm saying.
2639.0800000000004,2640.0800000000004, Yeah.
2640.0800000000004,2643.52, And talk about it online because really everything online is just look at the score.
2643.52,2644.52, Yeah.
2644.52,2649.32," I mean, you could write a very thoughtful analysis that discusses, you know, what are"
2649.32,2653.6800000000003, the implications of the fact that they wrote this story this way or that they had a conflict
2653.6800000000003,2656.5600000000004, between their story and the open-ended world.
2656.56,2660.16," You could discuss these issues and then you could just, you know, get feedback that's"
2660.16,2663.04," like like, what's this fucking wine cost?"
2663.04,2665.0, Just tell me if you liked it or not.
2665.0,2666.0, Yeah.
2666.0,2667.0, I don't understand those words.
2667.0,2672.2," In addition to that, I mean, even if you did basic word, I mean, even if it was accessible"
2672.2,2673.7999999999997," as possible, right?"
2673.7999999999997,2677.24, You deliberately kept your diction at a third grade reading level.
2677.24,2681.7599999999998," Although your thought process was well beyond that, you know, you could have, you"
2681.76,2688.0800000000004," can, you know, worked through high level collegiate thoughts and beyond with like any, you"
2688.0800000000004,2689.0800000000004," know, literacy level."
2689.0800000000004,2692.2400000000002," If you really said about it, you're going to be limited, but you could do it."
2692.2400000000002,2696.32," But aside from that, I think people just want, they look at reviewers for game, isn't"
2696.32,2701.7200000000003," stuff as they, they kind of expect them to pair it what they want to hear, you know?"
2701.7200000000003,2705.32," It's like they, they want to read the review that they would have written or that they"
2705.32,2709.2400000000002," probably could write that they would write if they had access to the game, you know,"
2709.24,2710.24, we want the exact thing.
2710.24,2716.24," I mean, you're, you're just there to say what I hope you say, not to disagree with me or"
2716.24,2717.24, anything.
2717.24,2718.24, And then so that's like a weird thing.
2718.24,2719.24, It challenged it.
2719.24,2720.24, Then they get angry.
2720.24,2723.0," The whole thing of like, oh, a critic disagrees with me."
2723.0,2724.0," I mean, that's great."
2724.0,2725.0, That's a point.
2725.0,2729.64," That's an avenue for, you know, finding something else about your own, you know, expectations"
2729.64,2731.4799999999996," in your own, you know, assumptions."
2731.4799999999996,2734.3599999999997, And then maybe learning to appreciate looking at things in another way.
2734.3599999999997,2735.68," And instead, all that's just gone."
2735.68,2740.44," And it's like, does this guy, is every single thing this guy says what I would say?"
2740.44,2741.44, Right.
2741.44,2744.68," When Lisa's cross-platform, so it removes that one thing from it."
2744.68,2748.9199999999996," Therefore, we see once again that the 360 kicks a PS3's ass."
2748.9199999999996,2751.2799999999997," No, at least there's not this this time."
2751.2799999999997,2754.3599999999997, But it goes just a fucking wake or for the 360.
2754.3599999999997,2761.44," It's also, like, in the world, in the world, the hardcore gamer and the game boners."
2761.44,2762.44, Yeah.
2762.52,2766.88," The review like becomes just another like, you know, position."
2766.88,2770.16," It's like another thing in the corner that you're watching, getting ready for the game."
2770.16,2771.56," You know, it's like, doggy stuff."
2771.56,2772.56," You're like, yeah, man."
2772.56,2773.56, Here it comes.
2773.56,2779.0," Like, so it's like the last, it's like the last moment before you get to go out and"
2779.0,2780.8, fly the game and say she ate yourself.
2780.8,2781.8, You know?
2781.8,2784.8, So it's like this clunk.
2784.8,2785.8," Yeah, right."
2785.8,2789.36," And if you show up and you're like, that's not that good."
2789.36,2790.36, Right.
2790.36,2791.36, Right.
2791.44,2792.84," Yeah, the old cold shower."
2792.84,2793.84, Yeah.
2793.84,2794.84, Yeah.
2794.84,2795.84, So that's kind of a bummer.
2795.84,2796.84, I don't know.
2796.84,2801.44," You know, I don't know what the audience for, for like, just talking about games,"
2801.44,2805.28," like, because you're interested in games and not really like trying to stoke a game"
2805.28,2806.28, boner.
2806.28,2807.28, Yeah.
2807.28,2809.1200000000003, Maybe that's always stealing a stoke in game boners.
2809.1200000000003,2810.7200000000003, It seems like the real conversation always comes out.
2810.7200000000003,2811.7200000000003, It's a game comes out.
2811.7200000000003,2813.52, It's a next house in three.
2813.52,2818.1600000000003," I mean, I noticed this phenomenon like it seems like the, you know, the real"
2818.16,2820.92, conversation has always come out like in the weeks after.
2820.92,2821.92, Yeah.
2821.92,2823.12, I'm going to say even on game rankings.
2823.12,2826.3199999999997," Like if you take a random game and like look at the score or whatever,"
2826.3199999999997,2828.3199999999997," when the like, lawn lawns day."
2828.3199999999997,2832.2," And then go back in a couple of weeks and see where it is after a few more, like,"
2832.2,2833.56, post release reviews came out.
2833.56,2835.44, It's not it doesn't go up.
2835.44,2839.56," What's weird, though, is that like people burn out on the stuff so fast."
2839.56,2840.92, So like I thought it grew.
2840.92,2845.68, And I think that we'll have even more interesting GTA discussions in a couple more weeks
2845.68,2846.68, or now.
2846.68,2850.12," But by then, the message words will be full of like, again, they're talking about it."
2850.12,2851.12, Right.
2851.12,2852.7999999999997, They're going to be doing about it with this podcast.
2852.7999999999997,2853.7999999999997, They will.
2853.7999999999997,2854.7999999999997, They can't.
2854.7999999999997,2856.6," Well, you're just, I mean, it's not even a week after."
2856.6,2861.6," I mean, I can understand that though because you just get so tired of it after,"
2861.6,2866.0," well, I mean, like, I haven't even been looking at message boards because I'm sick of looking"
2866.0,2869.44, at like threads about GTA.
2869.44,2870.44, Are you sick?
2870.44,2871.44, I was talking about it.
2871.44,2872.44," No, I like to talk about it."
2872.44,2875.2," I like to talk about it with you guys, but I can understand where people can get"
2875.4399999999996,2876.2, sick of it.
2876.2,2880.12," Yeah, I'm usually like a looking at NeoGaf, you know, every hour kind of person and I"
2880.12,2882.72, really haven't even opened it in like the past four days.
2882.72,2884.12," Yeah, I've kind of, I've been the same."
2884.12,2887.3999999999996," Yeah, it's been a while since I've really been active on any game forums."
2887.3999999999996,2889.7599999999998," Yeah, I mean, because that's all that's all that's going on."
2889.7599999999998,2890.7599999999998," Yeah, that's all that I've dominated."
2890.7599999999998,2893.3199999999997, So I can totally understand why people feel that way.
2893.3199999999997,2897.7599999999998, It's just a consequence of this like mega hype event thing.
2897.7599999999998,2900.4399999999996," You know, I mean, yeah, it's not the games that suffer from this."
2900.4399999999996,2901.8399999999997, Everything these days.
2901.8399999999997,2902.8399999999997, Sure.
2902.8399999999997,2903.8399999999997, But sure.
2903.92,2907.4," Yeah, I mean, I think also games are just so big and complicated that takes a while"
2907.4,2911.6000000000004, for people who really see what they think about it and to be able to talk about it.
2911.6000000000004,2914.88," And early on with the real reviews, it's not like the audience can participate."
2914.88,2915.88, Right.
2915.88,2916.88, I think it's good.
2916.88,2917.88, Right.
2917.88,2919.48, And I think to see what it's the legacy of this game down the line.
2919.48,2923.92," You know, are we going to think this was the greatest game ever in six months or is it"
2923.92,2925.6800000000003, going to be like Halo three again?
2925.6800000000003,2927.76, Whereas like everybody splooched all over it.
2927.76,2931.1600000000003," And then a few months later, it's like, oh, it's definitely better than Halo three."
2931.1600000000003,2932.1600000000003," Oh, yeah."
2932.1600000000003,2933.1600000000003, Yeah.
2933.16,2934.0, Definitely no question.
2934.0,2934.6, Halo three.
2934.6,2935.6, Yeah.
2935.6,2939.08," Anyway, I think maybe you might be getting lost in this."
2939.08,2942.0," But yeah, some of us actually really like the game despite what we're saying here."
2942.0,2943.0," Well, yeah."
2943.0,2944.0," No, that's right."
2944.0,2945.0, I'm going to play it.
2945.0,2946.0, I'm going to play it.
2946.0,2947.0, I'm going to play it.
2947.0,2948.0, Absolutely.
2948.0,2949.0, I think it's great.
2949.0,2950.52," And it's been a slow burn for me, too."
2950.52,2955.24," It's started out and it's just said, but annoyed at some of these early mechanics."
2955.24,2958.04, And then I got over that and actually got more into it.
2958.04,2963.0, Pines guy imagine in the game if there was some big secret where everyone
2963.0,2966.52," was like, this boy there wasn't like what the guys, you know, nationality is, but it"
2966.52,2971.92," was like that maybe a third of the way through or halfway through, there was like a hurricane"
2971.92,2973.88, or a tsunami or something or an earthquake.
2973.88,2977.56, And it radically changes the environment for some period in time.
2977.56,2980.92," But not only just the physical environment, but the way that everyone's behaving and"
2980.92,2981.92, it and stuff.
2981.92,2982.92," I mean, you have like riots."
2982.92,2984.12, I think like there's a black out.
2984.12,2986.52," I mean, just go crazy."
2986.52,2988.76, I have some of some things like that would be cool.
2988.76,2992.36," I mean, if there's like a period, like a week is stretching the game."
2992.44,2995.6400000000003," You're going through on a boat down your streets and stuff, you know, with a little"
2995.6400000000003,2996.6400000000003, outward on the back.
2996.6400000000003,2997.6400000000003, It's not been fence.
2997.6400000000003,2998.6400000000003, That's not the kind of thing.
2998.6400000000003,3003.6400000000003, It's not the kind of thing like the aftermath.
3003.6400000000003,3008.6," I mean, like something, when you look at a city, right, and you look at like the interesting"
3008.6,3012.88," things that happen to city outside, like natural disasters about as like 10 to 10"
3012.88,3013.88, as it gets.
3013.88,3014.88, But it also brings out.
3014.88,3019.04," It's always this crucible for all these things about, you know, like sociology and"
3019.12,3022.4, the way that humans interact with one another and stuff.
3022.4,3028.6," So yeah, I've also been like sort of craving something that would radically change"
3028.6,3030.24, the world once you get used to it.
3030.24,3031.4," You're like, you've been here."
3031.4,3032.24, You've seen it.
3032.24,3037.2799999999997, I think it would be really powerful to see what you could do to change that huge place
3037.2799999999997,3038.4, that you've gotten to know.
3038.4,3041.08," You know, so right down your street in the tsunami, man."
3041.08,3042.72, You're coming.
3042.72,3043.72, You can miss.
3043.72,3044.72, You can kind of get.
3044.72,3048.96," I thought I thought just having no cars around, you know, even if it's something"
3048.96,3052.84," some sort of really weird dream sequence that he has or something, like just having"
3052.84,3054.84, no people on the street would be interesting.
3054.84,3061.2400000000002," What if it turned like the big twist was like in the 75% of the way through, then it becomes"
3061.2400000000002,3062.2400000000002, a fucking zombie game.
3062.2400000000002,3062.88, There's like an hour.
3062.88,3066.0," Yeah, I was going to say like what if it would be a whole other game."
3066.0,3067.44," That's the kind of shit where you'd be like, that would be a."
3067.44,3068.44, Wow.
3068.44,3070.2400000000002, Like this is suddenly a whole other game.
3070.2400000000002,3070.7200000000003, Yeah.
3070.7200000000003,3073.64," And it's like, yeah, it would like who would complain about that."
3073.64,3074.64, That would be fun.
3074.64,3075.64, Yeah.
3075.64,3080.2," People that like to normal, uninfected people, but I mean, shit like that."
3080.2,3081.2," I mean, yeah, so much fun."
3081.2,3083.92," But whenever they tell Don the game, yeah, yeah."
3083.92,3084.92, Yeah.
3084.92,3087.92," Whenever they get it figured out, that's why I think like open world games would be so"
3087.92,3092.16," killer online, like continually updated, you know, where they could fuck with the world."
3092.16,3093.16, Yeah.
3093.16,3096.64," And like the story kind of unfolds, you know, over time."
3096.64,3099.96," Yeah, downloadable content could be within this case too, you know, I mean, where"
3099.96,3102.52," you have like, is like event packs."
3102.52,3106.56," So instead of like getting the pack words like the clothing shop and sims, it's like"
3106.56,3111.44, you have like the earthquake expansion and the zombie outbreak expansion.
3111.44,3114.04," Because they put all this work into the city, you know, yeah."
3114.04,3116.92," It's like, you guys can take that idea from me."
3116.92,3118.52, I know it means a lot of work and it's easy.
3118.52,3123.44," Like as as various developing the guests have said on here, ideas or a dime of dozen"
3123.44,3124.68, and implementation is everything.
3124.68,3129.44," But well, that means like, they look at world of workcraft because here's a game, you know,"
3129.44,3130.44, it's an MMO.
3130.44,3131.44, It's open world.
3131.44,3136.0," Like when they announced for a lich king that they're going to be taking this one city,"
3136.0,3137.76, which has been enclosed in the domes.
3137.76,3139.0, It's the dawn of time.
3139.0,3142.64, And they're going to like rip it out of the ground and make it hover over the ground
3142.64,3143.64, and take the dome off the screen.
3143.64,3144.64, Go in.
3144.64,3145.64, Everyone just flipped out.
3145.64,3147.2400000000002," They're just, no shit."
3147.2400000000002,3148.2400000000002, Yeah.
3148.2400000000002,3149.64," I mean, it's not true."
3149.64,3150.64, Yeah.
3150.64,3154.28," And just like, what if you were playing GT though and like that, and one of those events"
3154.28,3155.28," was like, what happened?"
3155.28,3156.64," You would, when she'd be just like, oh, yeah."
3156.64,3157.64, And the world.
3157.64,3161.2000000000003," We were at Blizzard maybe a couple of visits ago where Chris Metzon was saying, like,"
3161.3599999999997,3162.68, how awesome would it be?
3162.68,3163.96, And I don't know if we can even do this.
3163.96,3168.7599999999998," If like, we just destroyed Stormwind, which is like one of the central cities right now."
3168.7599999999998,3169.7599999999998, Everyone concrete.
3169.7599999999998,3173.24," But if we just like, there's an invasion and the whole city to just leveled."
3173.24,3174.24," Like, yeah."
3174.24,3177.04," And that was like, that would be pretty freaking awesome."
3177.04,3177.56, Yeah.
3177.56,3181.64," As a player of this game to just have like, your hub where you know, it's like a safe ground"
3181.64,3184.48," where you're always hanging out just to be like, totaled."
3184.48,3186.08, And it's changed things.
3186.08,3187.08, It's great.
3187.08,3188.08, Yeah.
3188.08,3189.08, And what's funny because he was talking about that.
3189.08,3190.08, That's just wow.
3190.08,3191.08, Yeah.
3191.08,3192.08, Yeah.
3192.08,3196.84," Like, as a designer, as a creative person, he was thinking, and he created this world."
3196.84,3200.88," So, and he's saying how much how fun it would be to destroy that city."
3200.88,3204.16," And yet it was Westrop because he kind of knew he couldn't, right?"
3204.16,3205.96, That the player revolt would be too much.
3205.96,3208.52," You know, just said, yeah, they're not, or what is it?"
3208.52,3209.52, I don't know.
3209.52,3210.52, Maybe technical limited.
3210.52,3213.2, Like a game that wasn't meant to say GTA couldn't take like this.
3213.2,3216.4," I suggest you're not having to do anything with it because the marketers would be like,"
3216.4,3219.4," well, are we going to market as a zombie game or are we going to market as much?"
3219.4,3220.4, That's a prime game.
3220.4,3221.4, Yeah.
3221.4,3222.4," No, real big."
3222.4,3223.4, That's a part of the thought.
3223.4,3224.4, That's seriously not your.
3224.4,3226.56," I, so you could do it with that."
3226.56,3229.56," But if someone else did, someone's like, we're going to make it like a GTA type game,"
3229.56,3230.56, but then this big secret.
3230.56,3232.76, And it's only like the second half of the game where there's a outbreak.
3232.76,3235.28," They'd be like, no, we got a market is this from the very beginning."
3235.28,3236.28, Right.
3236.28,3237.28, And that's got to be one or the other.
3237.28,3239.64, Like you want to keep it a secret.
3239.64,3241.64," And then like you're just told, no, you cannot keep it."
3241.64,3243.28, You don't tell the guys in marketing.
3243.28,3245.48," It's like, you have to, you make trailers."
3245.48,3246.48, Is there other games?
3246.48,3247.48, That does.
3247.48,3248.48, Yep.
3248.48,3251.68," And you guys read the, has any of you guys, is heavy."
3251.68,3252.68, Yeah.
3252.68,3255.08," Have you guys read that Douglas Copeland book, J-Pod?"
3255.08,3256.08, No.
3256.08,3261.52," It's about, it's vaguely based on the EA studio in Van Cover."
3261.52,3265.68, But it's about the sort of disgruntled group of game developers working on this ever
3265.68,3268.92," changing, terribly corporate video game."
3268.92,3273.72, And it like starts out as a skateboarding game and ends up being like a world of warcraft
3273.72,3274.72, game.
3274.72,3278.16, They just like take the skateboarding world and turn it into an RPG.
3278.24,3283.96," But the guys, the amazing thing is the guys in the studio who hate it so much."
3283.96,3287.8799999999997, They decide they're going to spend all their time working on a secret game inside of it.
3287.8799999999997,3295.08, And what it is is they build a torture layer for Ronald McDonald.
3295.08,3298.6, And Ronald McDonald is a character inside the studio layer.
3298.6,3300.2, And you can unleash him.
3300.2,3304.72, And he like comes out and just starts killing everyone in the world with like various
3304.72,3305.72, implements.
3305.72,3306.72, It's really a must read.
3306.72,3307.72," No, it's great."
3307.7999999999997,3308.72, I'm not kidding.
3308.72,3311.08, It's like a fucking message for a post.
3311.08,3313.08," Yeah, I'm fantastic."
3313.08,3314.08, It's really entertaining.
3314.08,3316.2799999999997," It's not as best book, but it's really entertaining."
3316.2799999999997,3317.8799999999997, Especially if you care about games.
3317.8799999999997,3323.3999999999996," And it's a pretty good, I think, feel of what, you know, like corporate game developer"
3323.3999999999996,3328.24," studio feels like on the inside, at least from the moments I've spent getting game demos."
3328.24,3333.48," And what would be great to have on here sometime, like, some, like, they could never"
3333.48,3334.72, do it because they get fired.
3334.72,3339.72," But you just want, like, some people who work at a game company, developers, whoever"
3339.72,3343.48," who are like stuck with a product and project that they hate, right?"
3343.48,3344.48, But they're doing it any.
3344.48,3346.8799999999997," Like a code of how to do, you don't typically hear from either."
3346.8799999999997,3347.8799999999997, Yeah.
3347.8799999999997,3349.72," That's like not, you know, that's largely invisible."
3349.72,3350.72, Right.
3350.72,3352.9599999999996, One of the many names and the credits that scroll.
3352.9599999999996,3354.48, And they're sitting there every day at their computer gun.
3354.48,3355.9599999999996, This is a fucking piece of shit.
3355.9599999999996,3360.04, I feel so bad for the people who spend 50 bucks on this.
3360.04,3364.3999999999996," That's actually, that's actually a good set of work on the bowling mini game anyway."
3364.48,3367.88," That's like, I feel like it's a good set of going for another game that I've been playing,"
3367.88,3369.6800000000003, which is the new Mario Kart.
3369.6800000000003,3370.6800000000003, Yeah.
3370.6800000000003,3373.6800000000003," And something that I noticed about the game, though, it's fun and it plays like Mario"
3373.6800000000003,3377.48," Kart and all that other shit, you know, I love, I've played every, like, major, I've"
3377.48,3381.8," played every Mario game, Mario Kart game period for extended period period of time."
3381.8,3388.1600000000003, But this particular version of it really comes across as so incredibly joyless.
3388.1600000000003,3393.6," Like, like, all the characters, you know, all the fun, fun, Nintendo characters and stuff,"
3393.64,3397.7599999999998," they're really, like, lifeless and there's no whimsy to it."
3397.7599999999998,3400.64," Like, you remember, like, playing the original Mario Kart and there's a weird idea."
3400.64,3404.16," They're like, we're going to take Mario characters and put them in go cards and they're"
3404.16,3405.16, going to race.
3405.16,3412.2," It had this, like, real light, whimsical, sensitive, like, you know, fun, you know, colorful"
3412.2,3413.2, fun.
3413.2,3415.64," This is like, oh, God, trapped in it."
3415.64,3416.64," Oh, God."
3416.64,3417.64, Now there's another Mario Kart game.
3417.64,3419.44, I have to make another one of these games.
3419.44,3421.24, I'm going to fucking kill myself.
3421.56,3426.4399999999996," You know, and like, while you're playing, you can practically hear the lives of the people"
3426.4399999999996,3427.8399999999997, making it being crushed.
3427.8399999999997,3433.3999999999996," I swear, I swear, I swear you can't, like the guy sitting around like having to come"
3433.3999999999996,3440.3999999999996," up with like the banana peel, like the banana, the banana peel character thing, the"
3440.3999999999996,3441.3999999999996, throw-out of the back.
3441.3999999999996,3446.24," He's like, oh, God, there's like, this, like, cloud hanging over it."
3446.24,3449.68, That it's just so manifesto stuff like in the characters themselves too.
3449.68,3451.68," Yeah, I mean, the princess peach has like, run."
3451.68,3452.68, Yeah.
3452.68,3457.68," The magic, like, if you were, it was coated entirely on the, it's a small world ride,"
3457.68,3461.7599999999998," but like, just like running, like they just like turn the, both the lever and he just runs"
3461.7599999999998,3463.3999999999996, the whole time and all the computers are in the cards.
3463.3999999999996,3465.3999999999996, But I think melted shit.
3465.3999999999996,3466.3999999999996, It's interesting.
3466.3999999999996,3467.3999999999996," Yeah, that's interesting."
3467.3999999999996,3468.3999999999996, Yeah.
3468.3999999999996,3470.0, I did not get necessarily that sense.
3470.0,3474.9199999999996," I do, there's definitely like, they're in traps, like they keep doing the same thing."
3474.9199999999996,3475.9199999999996, You know exactly what's coming.
3475.9199999999996,3477.3999999999996," Okay, here's the rainbow road."
3477.4,3481.4," Here's Bowser's castle when I know that Bowser's castle, Bowser's going to shoot a fireball"
3481.4,3482.4, in my head.
3482.4,3483.4," No, it feels really cleverly."
3483.4,3485.4," It's really, it's Heatherard."
3485.4,3486.4, Right.
3486.4,3488.4," They've like, they've been given real boundaries."
3488.4,3492.76," It's like they've figured out what makes it successful so they just got to like, repeat it"
3492.76,3494.76, and not change it too much.
3494.76,3496.4, And just not have very much fun with it.
3496.4,3497.4, Yeah.
3497.4,3504.0, It's such a weird schizophrenic face for Nintendo 2 with the company that very often will
3504.0,3507.2000000000003, really innovate and introduce some new mechanism or
3507.2,3511.12," like a game that really, you know, is genuinely new."
3511.12,3516.24," And then the company that all they ever do, you know, generation of hardware after generation"
3516.24,3518.24, is remake the same for games.
3518.24,3519.24," Oh, you're part of it."
3519.24,3521.24," Oh, I mean, the same like six games again and again."
3521.24,3522.24," Yeah, it's very true."
3522.24,3523.24, Did you hear me say nine?
3523.24,3524.24, Right.
3524.24,3525.24," I mean, clearly the we was."
3525.24,3526.24, I heard you.
3526.24,3531.56," I mean, yeah, the we was a revolution, right?"
3531.56,3533.24, But then game wise.
3533.24,3534.24, Yeah.
3534.24,3535.24, Yeah.
3535.24,3536.24, It doesn't last.
3536.24,3537.08, Come on.
3537.08,3538.08, You have a solution.
3538.08,3539.08, We'll be nothing.
3539.08,3540.08, Should have a revolution.
3540.08,3543.08," I think you can, and I think you can call it that fairly."
3543.08,3544.08, Yeah.
3544.08,3548.44," In terms of this console, especially in terms of what it did to the other two."
3548.44,3551.0," But yeah, but the games certainly haven't come through."
3551.0,3553.64, Of course we just gave a boom blocks and a plus.
3553.64,3557.2799999999997, I must pick up a couple of blocks and then give it a double.
3557.2799999999997,3558.64," Now, I think that's here."
3558.64,3561.56," We haven't talked about one PC game yet, but Ryan is saying whatever."
3561.56,3564.6, Ryan's been playing Mario Kart as well.
3564.6,3565.6, Yeah.
3565.6,3566.6," I'm going to force you to do it, man."
3566.6,3569.96," You clamp up every time I'm on the podcast, but you get the huge fucking rant."
3569.96,3571.96, You gave me right in my own.
3571.96,3572.96," He said, you know what?"
3572.96,3573.96, He's doing it.
3573.96,3574.96, He told me earlier.
3574.96,3575.96, I was ever as desk.
3575.96,3576.96, Yeah.
3576.96,3580.0, Really cannot stand the sound of your voice.
3580.0,3581.68, And when he's.
3581.68,3582.68, Can.
3582.68,3587.96, But he really can't stand the sound of your voice and when he comes on here and you're
3587.96,3588.96, on here.
3588.96,3589.96, You're doing it too.
3589.96,3590.96, You're putting words in his mouth.
3590.96,3591.96, We should have it out.
3591.96,3592.96, We all do right now.
3592.96,3593.96, Ryan.
3593.96,3594.96, There is no right.
3594.96,3595.96, We should have announced that.
3595.96,3604.96, You're just sitting here thinking about your spreadsheet right now.
3604.96,3608.52, You're like ticking off all the things you got to do when you get back to your desk.
3608.52,3610.7200000000003, He was showing me his elaborate color coded spreadsheet.
3610.7200000000003,3611.7200000000003, Ryan has some amazing results.
3611.7200000000003,3614.92," I think you need to get him my head, but we're actually."
3614.92,3616.52, I know everything about you.
3616.52,3617.52, What do you feel about?
3617.52,3618.52, You feel about dressed alike today.
3618.52,3619.52, Tell me everything.
3619.52,3620.52, We're dressed for days.
3620.52,3621.52, We're eight.
3621.52,3622.52," You're wearing canvas shoes, too."
3622.6,3624.56, We're both right in iron.
3624.56,3628.52, We're both wearing green button up shirts and canvas shoes.
3628.52,3630.52, We could be in the double mint gum.
3630.52,3631.52, Yeah.
3631.52,3632.52, Okay.
3632.52,3634.52, So let's get to your mark.
3634.52,3635.52, All right.
3635.52,3640.44, So I have been playing a bunch of Mario Kart.
3640.44,3644.6," And this game, it's, you know, I'm having fun with it more than I did with the game"
3644.6,3645.6, cube game.
3645.6,3647.44, I thought the game cube was kind of sucked.
3647.44,3651.92, But this game more than any other Mario Kart.
3651.92,3659.16, Unlike the totally insane Mario Kart 64 is subject to what I have come to call in recent
3659.16,3662.08, days in Nintendo fairness.
3662.08,3666.4," And what that means is, you know, you'll be, you're, you're good to the game, whatever"
3666.4,3668.2400000000002, you're going to the first place.
3668.2400000000002,3669.2400000000002, And even the blue child.
3669.2400000000002,3671.28, I'm not just talking about the blue child.
3671.28,3676.16," Even in like the lowest, like, 50cc like mushroom cup, like the beginner races that"
3676.16,3678.2000000000003," you're like, oh, I can do this with my eyes closed."
3678.2000000000003,3681.88, You're like under constant siege in this game.
3681.88,3685.12," Like, it's like, I just got hit by a blue shell and I just got hit by two red shell."
3685.12,3686.12, It's true.
3686.12,3687.12, It's true.
3687.12,3690.44, By a power block and a lightning bolt and an e-block all within the same 15 seconds.
3690.44,3691.44, Yeah.
3691.44,3693.44," This one I've noticed, especially like, like, reins of pores."
3693.44,3694.44," I, I, I, I, what?"
3694.44,3696.12, It's one of those things where you form in your head.
3696.12,3697.96," You're like, I swear the AI is gang up on me."
3697.96,3698.96, I know they're doing this.
3698.96,3702.76," And then it'll hit you all the stuff and knock you back to like last place, but it's like,"
3702.76,3705.04," well, next item, my hit's going to be a golden mushroom."
3705.04,3706.56, And I'll be back up to first place.
3706.56,3707.56, Or the bull.
3707.56,3708.56, Right.
3708.56,3709.56," So I can Mario Party on wheels, man."
3709.56,3710.56, It actually is.
3710.6,3712.2, I think it sounds horrible.
3712.2,3715.44, Maybe maybe maybe maybe Mario Kart really has something to say.
3715.44,3722.68, Maybe Mario Kart is the gaming manifestation of the tyranny of progressive taxation.
3723.4,3726.96," So like, you're being punished because you're such a good racer."
3726.96,3727.56, You're ahead.
3727.56,3728.56, You're number one.
3728.56,3736.2799999999997, And here come all these terrible slow racers with their blue shells and their red shells.
3736.2799999999997,3740.0, Trying to steal your rightful place at the time of the world.
3740.0,3741.0, Yeah.
3741.0,3742.0, And the middle.
3742.0,3744.76, Maybe that's what the Jeremy Parrish compared to the communism.
3744.76,3745.76," So no, eight."
3745.76,3746.76, Yeah.
3746.76,3747.76," Oh, wow."
3747.76,3748.76, So you're not even the first to make it.
3748.76,3749.76, There you go.
3749.76,3752.76, The power says both equality of opportunity and equality of outcome as well.
3752.76,3753.76, Okay.
3753.76,3754.76, Okay.
3754.76,3755.76, Okay.
3755.76,3756.76, And you believe in America and you believe in capital.
3756.76,3757.76, You won't play fucking.
3757.76,3758.76, Get this idea.
3758.76,3760.16, It's game out of your house right now.
3760.16,3761.16, Yeah.
3761.16,3762.16, All right.
3762.16,3763.16," The thing is, okay."
3763.16,3765.36," So like that's that's, you know, bad enough."
3765.36,3767.0, There's an option to turn all the items off by the way.
3767.0,3768.0, Yeah.
3768.0,3769.0, We put in like we love it.
3769.0,3769.84, So we get you angry.
3769.84,3770.84, What's up in multiplayer there?
3770.84,3771.84, Are you talking about single player?
3771.84,3772.84, I'm talking about single character.
3772.84,3773.84, Okay.
3773.84,3774.84," And the thing, okay."
3774.84,3780.6000000000004," And the other thing, which in turn is notorious for, is locking like half the game"
3780.6000000000004,3782.36, behind ridiculous.
3782.36,3784.84," Oh, the box."
3784.84,3785.84," Like, like, ridiculous."
3785.84,3786.84," Oh, yeah."
3786.84,3787.84, That's a lot.
3787.84,3788.84, Yeah.
3788.84,3793.7200000000003," And it's like, you know, when you know, a bunch of the characters and vehicles and stuff,"
3793.7200000000003,3798.76, you have to get a star rank in like the respective circuit to unlock whatever it is you're
3798.76,3799.76, trying to unlock.
3799.76,3805.76, You have to get first place in every race in the circuit and you have to do well on a
3805.76,3807.6000000000004, per-lact basis.
3807.6000000000004,3809.6000000000004," So, you know, yes."
3809.6000000000004,3810.6000000000004," Yeah, because you're right."
3810.6000000000004,3812.0800000000004, And get a baby but still win.
3812.0800000000004,3813.0800000000004, Right.
3813.0800000000004,3818.48, And so like doing that and getting like whatever character is unlocked by doing 150cc special
3818.48,3820.6800000000003," cuff, like you're throwing a dart at a board."
3820.6800000000003,3821.6800000000003, It's stupid.
3821.6800000000003,3824.0, But they got you by the balls because it's like none of us care.
3824.0,3827.5200000000004," We were like, when you said, you're playing single player, we're like who the fuck's"
3827.5200000000004,3828.5200000000004, doing that?
3828.5200000000004,3829.5200000000004, You really want to know this?
3829.52,3830.52, Is he's Daisy Mobio?
3830.52,3831.52, This is the problem.
3831.52,3832.52, But you can't help yourself.
3832.52,3834.52, What about you have to do it about track.
3834.52,3838.44," The problem is they like, they do this with fundamentally multiplayer games."
3838.44,3843.24," Like there's just the only reason you're playing the single player version of Mario Party,"
3843.24,3844.24, which is like hell.
3844.24,3845.24, It's a playstyle.
3845.24,3846.24, It's a playstyle.
3846.24,3847.24, It's done lock stuff for the multiplayer game.
3847.24,3848.24, Yeah.
3848.24,3850.04, All you want to do with this game is like four people are over.
3850.04,3851.04, Let's play Mario Party.
3851.04,3852.04, Super fast.
3852.04,3853.04, Yeah.
3853.04,3855.6, It's been 12 hours like dealing with it's nonsense.
3855.6,3857.6," And super smash bet is what was the same way, too."
3857.6,3858.6, Right.
3858.6,3859.6, You love that game.
3859.6,3860.6, I love super smash bet.
3860.6,3861.6, So what's why?
3861.6,3862.6, What?
3862.6,3864.6, I love super smash bet is awesome.
3864.6,3865.6, Yeah.
3865.6,3866.6, But why?
3866.6,3867.6, Tell us why you got to unlock this shit.
3867.6,3868.6, Let's get to the heart of that.
3868.6,3869.6, What's the date you have to lock away?
3869.6,3872.6, They do lock away the tracks and stuff.
3872.6,3874.6, Like I don't have all the tracks of mock.
3874.6,3877.6, Like things that are fundamental to gameplay.
3877.6,3880.6, Like don't unlock those.
3880.6,3882.6, Like it's so caliber to another bad one.
3882.6,3884.6, The lock like half the characters away.
3884.6,3888.08, Like lock extra outfit and like the stupid extra weapon I'm not going to use.
3888.08,3889.08, That's fine.
3889.08,3892.08, But don't lock the stuff that you've been like one hit in character.
3892.08,3896.08, Even unlocking it just purely through multiple player play.
3896.08,3897.08, I don't know.
3897.08,3898.08," But again, yeah."
3898.08,3899.08, Like what I want.
3899.08,3900.08, Like what I want.
3900.08,3901.08, It's a stupid.
3901.08,3904.08, It's like when you every time I want to play Servantez you got to go do the horseshit.
3904.08,3906.08, He's like been in it every time.
3906.08,3907.08, He's a lot of people's main character.
3907.08,3908.08, Right.
3908.08,3909.08, Why are we going through this?
3909.08,3913.08," I think they just really imagine that the audience for the game is just like, you know,"
3913.08,3917.08, obsessive compulsive ass burgers of talk you nerd.
3917.08,3921.08," Who's going to sit there and be like, oh my god, I got a lot of prints of Daisy."
3921.08,3923.08," You know, you think that's the one."
3923.08,3924.08, And they post about it.
3924.08,3925.08, And just a page print.
3925.08,3927.08, Do you think the coupicates are going to have a carton this one?
3927.08,3930.08," I mean, that's like a video."
3930.08,3932.08, I would sit there and talk a kid too.
3932.08,3933.08, What's that?
3933.08,3934.08, I'm there Ryan.
3934.08,3935.08, I'm there next to Ryan.
3935.08,3936.08, Yeah.
3936.08,3939.08," Well, like I've already given up on Mario Kart."
3939.08,3945.08," But like when I'm playing a game, it's like I know there's like some huge, like,"
3945.08,3949.08," important thing, like important to the game play to unlock a character, whatever,"
3949.08,3950.08, to what I'm doing.
3950.08,3951.08, Like I cease to play the game for fun.
3951.08,3954.08, And now it's suddenly like a job like I'm unlocking this thing.
3954.08,3955.08, How do you feel?
3955.08,3958.08," How do you feel about doing that in Team Portrait 2,"
3958.08,3961.08, which I know you've been doing farming groups of people?
3961.08,3962.08, I hate it.
3962.08,3963.08, I don't like that.
3963.08,3965.08," I think they, I think the team fortress too."
3965.08,3970.08, But you weren't playing the game until this group of achievements to farm was launched.
3970.08,3972.08," I was taking, I was taking it off."
3972.08,3973.08," You're not getting in, dude."
3974.08,3978.08, And you precisely begin playing again when they introduce something that you hate doing.
3978.08,3980.08, That's your alleged behavior doing.
3980.08,3982.08, This is something I'm going to hate.
3982.08,3983.08, But I got to get all of it.
3983.08,3984.08, And that's my point.
3984.08,3985.08," I'm, I'm Ben."
3985.08,3986.08, You got to catch them all of these.
3986.08,3989.08, You do have all the unlockable items for that.
3989.08,3991.08, And you already have the chicken to stop playing then.
3991.08,3992.08, No.
3992.08,3995.08," I will after a certain, I mean, I take breaks every now and then."
3995.08,3997.08, But I will kill the next bullshit comes out for you.
3997.08,3998.08, No.
3998.08,3999.08, No.
3999.08,4001.08, I'm not trying to beat it.
4001.08,4002.08, I honestly think this.
4002.08,4006.08, I think deep down inside you probably know either some truth to what I'm saying.
4006.08,4007.08, Okay.
4007.08,4013.08, But it's true that some gamers just have this thing like mechanism like the got to catch them off.
4013.08,4014.08, I'm collecting.
4014.08,4015.08, We can't afford to.
4015.08,4018.08, It's a world of powercraft person.
4018.08,4019.08, Yeah.
4019.08,4023.08," With team fortress two, I know I've never going to be able to reasonably get these unless I do it right now."
4023.08,4024.08, Yeah.
4024.08,4026.08, And it's new when everybody's farming these things.
4026.08,4029.08, Can it's going to be a chore to get that group of people that you need?
4029.08,4030.08, Why not just put that one like.
4030.08,4031.08, I want to slid you.
4031.08,4032.08, I want to slid you.
4032.08,4033.08, Get rid of the requirements or something.
4033.08,4034.08, Yeah.
4034.08,4035.08, Now you can just have them.
4035.08,4038.08, Why not just play it as the game was intended to be played there.
4038.08,4041.08," I mean, do you think you because you really want those weapons?"
4041.08,4047.08, Because most of those things are not accomplishable by the average person in normal play.
4047.08,4048.08, That was the mistake.
4048.08,4049.08, I think.
4049.08,4050.08, Yeah.
4050.08,4051.08, I do.
4051.08,4053.08, I think they should have just given everybody the weapons.
4053.08,4056.08, Like they shouldn't have made the weapons on moxious here are the weapons.
4056.08,4059.08, And here are these achievements for the people who want to get achievements.
4060.08,4062.08, There are people who are going to just get the achievements just to do.
4062.08,4063.08, So what are the examples?
4063.08,4065.08, Because I haven't followed us.
4065.08,4068.08, What are examples of the kind of things you've had to do to get these weapons?
4068.08,4069.08," Oh, God."
4069.08,4073.08," There's, um, they're all, you know, this new medicachievement pack."
4073.08,4074.08, There are 39 achievements.
4074.08,4076.08, There's three new weapons.
4076.08,4081.08," And you, you get, they unlock at intervals, you know, one third achievement."
4081.08,4083.08, You get the first one or two thirds.
4083.08,4086.08, And some of them are reasonable.
4087.08,4090.08," But some of them are like, you know, you have to get assist kills."
4090.08,4097.08, You and a heavy have to get 20 kills where neither of you die like in a single life.
4097.08,4098.08, Right.
4098.08,4100.08," And that's, that's insane."
4100.08,4102.08, We're going to punch five people.
4102.08,4103.08," Oh, yeah."
4103.08,4106.08, You have to get assist kills on a heavy punch and a bunch of people.
4106.08,4107.08," Um, there's one."
4107.08,4109.08, It's like heel a total of one million.
4109.08,4113.08, This has got to be like a lot of experiments on balance part.
4113.08,4115.08, That's the only explanation for the.
4116.08,4117.08, Who's insane?
4117.08,4118.08, See what happens.
4118.08,4119.08," Oh, there's one."
4119.08,4121.08," This, this is a total bitch for the men."
4121.08,4125.08, I just could it's much harder comparatively for him to earn points just healing.
4125.08,4128.08," But there's one word like, um, and this is one of one of the empowering problems with."
4128.08,4131.08, I only need to be more achievement because one of them.
4131.08,4135.08," Um, you have to not kill anybody."
4135.08,4138.08, But you have to get the most point.
4138.08,4141.08, You have to get the high score on your team on a team of six or more.
4141.08,4143.08, Like without killing anybody.
4143.08,4146.08," And that's like, I don't know how you would do that like in a real."
4146.08,4148.08, No game has a medic.
4148.08,4151.08," Some people surprising that they've, oh, I think that they will."
4151.08,4155.08, They almost like the the medic game that this is created more than the game itself.
4155.08,4157.08, Maybe people that are very good or they just.
4157.08,4162.08, What they like is the they probably feel like they've never cooperated so close to with people and they're.
4162.08,4164.08, They're a little bit of that to it.
4164.08,4168.08," And because they go in it like, like, like, like a wow group sort of like everybody's got to."
4168.08,4170.08, Do they have a partner way?
4170.08,4172.08," Yeah, they all go into a server."
4172.08,4177.08, And oftentimes with a map called a treatment box or something created just for farming.
4177.08,4180.08, And they'll all go in there and agree that there's going to be a leader.
4180.08,4183.08, He's telling everyone who they do and then it's like putting it on your player or something.
4183.08,4184.08," It's like, okay."
4184.08,4185.08," No, no, no, no."
4185.08,4186.08, Mr. line.
4186.08,4189.08, The one up there's a server called the one at Madhouse.
4189.08,4190.08, And they've been doing that.
4190.08,4192.08," Yeah, that's what we're, we're, I've been."
4192.08,4195.08," Well, my friend Matt went in there and got banned."
4195.08,4197.08," No, okay, like killing all you guys when you're doing that."
4197.08,4207.08," Yeah, I don't know, I think I think also sometimes people like structure and games more than not structure."
4207.08,4217.08," Like having a goal, having something to do besides like, you know, when the game killed the other side, you know, so you have really specific."
4217.08,4220.08, And I definitely can appreciate that.
4220.08,4225.08," And in, in sort of open into games or multiplayer games that you play a ton."
4225.08,4227.08, I've been enjoying the D.T.
4227.08,4236.08," Chalera achievements have been that they're kind of, they feel like a little more like buying the sky like these in a way."
4236.08,4240.08," Like if the achievements were easier, I probably would be distracted."
4240.08,4244.08," Isn't there one, a K-A4 that's like kill a rock star employee?"
4244.08,4245.08, What?
4245.08,4246.08, Like in the game.
4246.08,4254.08," Did you hear the, speaking of GTA rumors, did you hear the one about how there's a website URL in the game's meta, you know, internet?"
4254.08,4257.08," And if you put it in, it's like a child porn site."
4257.08,4262.08," And then the moment that you enter that, you're wanting rating goes to five stars."
4262.08,4264.08," Yeah, and I've heard that too."
4264.08,4265.08," Yeah, I've heard that too."
4265.08,4273.08," And I haven't tried that out, but I believe it because when you go to the web, you know, the web stuff, there's some like cheesy lame shit on there."
4273.08,4276.08," I mean, and it looks like it goes a couple layers deep."
4276.08,4280.08," If you keep clicking on URL, so I wouldn't be surprised if they did that."
4280.08,4283.08," Yeah, but that would, I hope that's very funny."
4283.08,4298.08," Yeah, but, but I guess my point was just that, like, I'm somebody who I don't try to be an achievement or, but if I see that they're there and they're not that hard, I will distract myself from the real game a little bit."
4298.08,4299.08, That's just really how I am.
4299.08,4304.08," Especially in the game like GTA where it's easy to just say, okay, well, I failed this mission three times."
4304.08,4307.08, I guess I'll go collect 40 packages because I was easy.
4307.08,4308.08, Right.
4308.08,4312.08," But in this one, the achievements seem sort of harder, so I'm not even tempted."
4312.08,4314.08," No, like not going to win 50, right."
4314.08,4321.08," Like the pigeons are what are as soon as I found out there are, I shot one and was like, okay enough on to other 277, like, no, never do this."
4321.08,4322.08," Yeah, that's an insane."
4322.08,4323.08, I'm not even going to bother.
4323.08,4325.08," Okay, bring up gamefacuse.com."
4325.08,4326.08, Yeah.
4326.08,4327.08, Find the location of each old.
4327.08,4328.08, Thank you.
4328.08,4329.08," Yeah, I don't think so."
4329.08,4330.08, Yeah.
4330.08,4331.08, Yeah.
4331.08,4332.08, Yeah.
4332.08,4337.08," I usually, I've only time I've ever really gotten into achievements for some reason when I get into a game that I"
4337.08,4346.08," develop like a trying to be really good at kind of relationship to the game, like when in plus for Xbox live came out."
4346.08,4348.08, And I kept on trying to get the achievements for that game.
4348.08,4351.08," That game makes me want to murder myself, but I played hours."
4351.08,4354.08," Yeah, it's kind of games were like so, right?"
4354.08,4356.08," Yeah, it's a high score."
4356.08,4359.08," Yeah, I've just just a high score, basically, in a different form."
4359.08,4360.08, Yeah.
4360.08,4366.08," And I've unlocked several of those achievements and like felt a momentary, you know, moment of, like, bliss."
4366.08,4367.08, I've been on the list.
4367.08,4368.08, I've been on the list.
4368.08,4369.08, I've been on the list.
4369.08,4370.08, I've been on the list.
4370.08,4371.08, I fell on the same trap with a.
4371.08,4372.08, Yeah.
4372.08,4373.08, Pack-man championship.
4373.08,4374.08, Uh-huh.
4374.08,4375.08, I do that too.
4375.08,4376.08, Same game.
4376.08,4382.08," What is we need to get the, uh, is it Gellaga championship or space invaders like Deluxe or something."
4382.08,4383.08, I love space invaders.
4383.08,4384.08, I really do.
4384.08,4386.08," I have a big, I think it looks great."
4386.08,4387.08," I have a big, I think."
4387.08,4388.08, It looks great.
4388.08,4389.08, Yeah.
4389.08,4390.08," Oh, is that right?"
4390.08,4391.08," Oh, that's great."
4391.08,4392.08, Yeah.
4392.08,4393.08, I don't need that.
4393.08,4394.08," I, you just don't need that."
4394.08,4400.08," I, you know, I tried to play on Xbox Live for, uh, for GTA for and we got on there and it's,"
4400.08,4403.08," like, we being our usual like a group of ventrilope PC gamers."
4403.08,4408.08," And it was like, we're all bitching the second we're on and we hear voices there."
4408.08,4411.08," And I also sound like, you know, complete crap."
4411.08,4413.08," And then it's like, we start a private chat channel."
4413.08,4416.08," Then someone sent, you want someone sends you a voice message and listen to it."
4416.08,4418.08, You got to jump out of the chat.
4418.08,4421.08," And from that moment, we're just like, this spot, just supposed to hate it."
4421.08,4423.08, And then just bitching about every little thing.
4423.08,4426.08," In fact, that we can't even choose what team we're on when we're hosting a multiplayer game."
4426.08,4429.08, And then some strangers popped in the server.
4429.08,4431.08, And one of them starts singing.
4431.08,4436.08," And then the next guy's like, um, dude, this is, no, it wasn't even that kind of voice."
4436.08,4438.08," It was like, man, this is the ratest."
4438.08,4441.08, This is the fucking most badass game I've put in the plane.
4441.08,4445.08," And then, where are you like, well, my name is a barat."
4445.08,4447.08, And then we all fucking like logged out.
4447.08,4448.08, And that was it.
4448.08,4449.08, We went back to the PC.
4450.08,4453.08," Ah, you'll wait for it to come out on PC."
4453.08,4459.08, So I'll have to like convince myself to plug the ethernet cable back into the download space and raiders.
4459.08,4462.08," Haha, it's a romantic."
4462.08,4465.08, Sean is a true PC gamer.
4465.08,4469.08," And you won't quit fidgeting with this fucking, he's turning it into a doll."
4469.08,4470.08, His own art plane.
4470.08,4472.08," Oh, yeah, this whole show."
4472.08,4475.08, He likes meth tweaking over there.
4476.08,4480.08, Did you be a lightbowlman all turned into a pot bond for a pop pipe for you?
4480.08,4481.08, Okay.
4481.08,4484.08," So Sean, do you have any more impressions of Conan?"
4484.08,4487.08, You want to share it because I want to talk about a PC game?
4487.08,4489.08," Yeah, I'm thinking maybe it's time."
4489.08,4490.08, Conan.
4490.08,4491.08," No, no, it's a plate right?"
4491.08,4492.08, I'm feeling like.
4492.08,4493.08," Well, I tried to, but you had to manage."
4493.08,4495.08, I have this weird problem with it.
4495.08,4496.08, Conan.
4496.08,4498.08, Your weird problem is that it doesn't run.
4498.08,4499.08," Well, it doesn't log."
4499.08,4503.08," It's that if you go to task manager, it's not, you know,"
4504.08,4507.08, I'll log into the game with my name and password.
4507.08,4508.08, It accepts it.
4508.08,4511.08, There's a loading screen for a minute and then just nothing.
4511.08,4514.08," If you go to task manager, it shows that there's no game."
4514.08,4517.08," List it, but if you go to processes in there,"
4517.08,4519.08," you see age of Conan, dottyx running."
4519.08,4521.08," So, I don't know what's going on."
4521.08,4522.08, Isn't that interesting?
4522.08,4525.08, They also in my task manager bar.
4525.08,4526.08," Oh, yes."
4526.08,4528.08, There's much ram items is using.
4528.08,4529.08, I'm sorry.
4529.08,4531.08, Maybe we could do like a task.
4531.08,4532.08, I'm done.
4532.08,4533.08, I'm done.
4533.08,4534.08, There are some really.
4534.08,4535.08, I'm sure there are.
4535.08,4536.08," Oh, fuck."
4536.08,4537.08, Yeah.
4537.08,4538.08, So there's system trade.
4538.08,4539.08, There are two weeks.
4539.08,4541.08, We're system trade.
4541.08,4542.08, Yeah.
4542.08,4543.08, Okay.
4543.08,4544.08," So, okay."
4544.08,4546.08, Here's what I'll say about age of Conan.
4546.08,4549.08, MMOs have this problem.
4549.08,4551.08, And I think people that they haven't really.
4551.08,4553.08, No one's figured out how to how to solve it.
4553.08,4555.08," And by a word, kind of said, but whatever,"
4555.08,4557.08, there I'm almost going to be at my feet star wars.
4557.08,4558.08, It might not be Star Wars.
4558.08,4559.08, Who knows what it is.
4559.08,4564.08, They're going to latch onto this thing that no one has been able to figure out.
4564.08,4565.08, And that's story.
4565.08,4572.08," So, you know, making this narrative feel like it's your own even though the mechanics"
4572.08,4574.08, of them and those make that almost impossible.
4574.08,4579.08," Like, because of the fact that you're running around with 2,000 other people in the same"
4579.08,4581.08," server, like there's just no way."
4581.08,4582.08, Yeah.
4582.08,4583.08, Huh?
4583.08,4585.08," Each or a, that's not a second."
4585.08,4588.08, There's just no way that you're going to like make it.
4588.08,4589.08, Make it personal.
4589.08,4594.08," What I'm quite so Conan's solution to this, which is really a clue G,"
4594.08,4599.08," is that the first 20 levels of the game more or less, you go, like,"
4599.08,4603.08," pretty much when the first five level of doing some newbies stuff, then you come out into the world"
4603.08,4605.08, proper and there are people running around doing your standard quest.
4605.08,4607.08, You have quest givers who have an exclamation point.
4607.08,4609.08," They're like, find me 30 pelts."
4609.08,4611.08," And they're like, okay, I'll find 30 pelts for you."
4611.08,4614.08," Conther guys like, oh, kill 20 crocodile."
4614.08,4615.08," And you're like, okay, whatever."
4615.08,4618.08," So you go, you go into the basement of a tavern."
4618.08,4624.08, And there's a guy who can switch it to nighttime and then all the other players go away.
4624.08,4627.08, And you're in your own instance of the world with completely different quests.
4627.08,4629.08, And it's like a linear story.
4629.08,4633.08," So their solution to make MMO's personal was to have a button that doesn't turn,"
4633.08,4635.08, that turns it into a single player game.
4635.08,4637.08, It sounds like guild wars.
4637.08,4640.08, How long does that go on for?
4640.08,4643.08, Because this has been going on for like a little 15 now.
4643.08,4646.08, And it's been going on for a while.
4646.08,4650.08," And I haven't been compelled to switch the toggle switch back to MMO mode,"
4650.08,4653.08, which I think we've been there with a single player co-name.
4653.08,4655.08," Yeah, it kind of directs you to."
4655.08,4658.08," I mean, because the quests are, you know,"
4658.08,4661.08, it's kind of leading up into like how you get your spells and stuff.
4661.08,4663.08," I mean, yeah, what if you never get that part?"
4663.08,4664.08, What if he just did?
4664.08,4665.08, I don't know.
4665.08,4666.08, Would you be able to out of the re-roll and find out?
4666.08,4668.08, Because I've been doing the nighttime stuff the whole time.
4668.08,4669.08, I think I'm at the end of it.
4669.08,4672.08," But, and it's totally is just an MMO."
4672.08,4676.08," I mean, here's the other thing is MMOs at the first 20 levels,"
4676.08,4678.08, like World of Warcraft or most other ones.
4678.08,4680.08, You don't really play with other people.
4680.08,4681.08, I find I don't.
4681.08,4685.08, I find that that's like the learning and leveling phase and like walking in and meeting.
4685.08,4688.08," And seeing someone else like kill your borr is more just like,"
4688.08,4689.08," oh, god damn him."
4689.08,4690.08, He killed my borr.
4690.08,4691.08, I was in my borr.
4691.08,4692.08," You don't like, you don't."
4692.08,4693.08, There's no reason to interact with him anyway.
4693.08,4695.08, And I think they just kind of are acknowledging that.
4695.08,4698.08," And there's really a clue to you like, all right, let's just turn into a single player."
4698.08,4700.08, I'll have someone to play with otherwise.
4700.08,4702.08, I'm getting fucking mind lovingly boring.
4702.08,4703.08, And I want those pills.
4704.08,4708.08," Yeah. I wish there was an MMO that instead of using the game world,"
4708.08,4710.08, just use the internet.
4710.08,4712.08," So, and you have these random tasks that would be more like,"
4712.08,4716.08," okay, log on to second life and buy a foulless."
4716.08,4719.08," And that's like a scaven task, task complete."
4719.08,4725.08," You know, buy, you know, some really terrible CD on Amazon."
4725.08,4727.08, That they could make a game.
4727.08,4729.08," You're like, you're like, you're like, you're like, you're like, you're like, you're like,"
4729.08,4730.08, me now right now.
4730.08,4733.08, What's that game that's playing a while ago?
4733.08,4734.08, I already forget the name.
4734.08,4736.08," I think it was like something awful,"
4736.08,4737.08, Goones might have had a hand in it.
4737.08,4740.08," It's like, the the meta internet, like RPG."
4740.08,4741.08, Four and more.
4741.08,4742.08," 4 more, yeah."
4742.08,4746.08," And instead of going to the real second life or something,"
4746.08,4747.08, it's all based on it.
4747.08,4748.08," It creates, like mocha,"
4748.08,4750.08, it's the messenger clients and email
4750.08,4752.08," and websites and it's just like,"
4752.08,4755.08," just embedded with tons and tons of, like, crazy shit like that."
4755.08,4756.08, Yeah.
4756.08,4757.08," Thank you, my liking."
4757.08,4758.08, Yeah.
4758.08,4761.04, but I would enjoy it if it were actually in the real world.
4761.04,4761.88," They give the seaguards,"
4761.88,4765.24, I'm especially YouTube video and make a comment.
4765.24,4766.48," Like, it's a troll."
4766.48,4767.48, It's a troll this way.
4767.48,4770.32," Yeah, that was probably someone out there doing that."
4770.32,4772.04, Make that game because I'm lazy.
4773.76,4774.76, We can do anyway.
4774.76,4777.88," In our vent chain, we pretty much have the spontaneous things"
4777.88,4780.4, where we have a guy that basically plays DJ in plays YouTube
4780.4,4782.8, but then we'll come up with stuff like troll night.
4782.8,4786.36," That's TR, Y-L-L-L-Y-G-H-T."
4786.36,4789.12," Yeah, we all just decide, like, yeah, let's go to this thread"
4789.12,4791.0, and it's all take turns trolling it
4791.0,4793.4, and then let's go over to this forum and do it.
4793.4,4795.16," So it's kind of, you don't get a prize for it,"
4795.16,4796.2, but you can join in.
4796.2,4797.639999999999, I can only do it if I get a prize.
4797.639999999999,4800.639999999999, We'll give you a give you this cane stitch.
4800.639999999999,4804.88, I'm in the 50 or 100 gold pieces.
4804.88,4807.599999999999, I think I'll need a chance to get you those.
4807.599999999999,4808.599999999999," Yeah, I can actually shoulder."
4808.599999999999,4811.12, So this is also the MMO that changes everything
4811.12,4813.839999999999, because you can attack in multiple directions.
4813.839999999999,4814.839999999999, It's true.
4815.4400000000005,4816.4400000000005, What is that in me?
4816.4400000000005,4818.64," Okay, let me wrap up my other feathers."
4818.64,4820.96," When you are in the nighttime mode,"
4820.96,4824.28, the quests actually aren't the fetch 30 of this
4824.28,4825.12, or get 20 of that.
4825.12,4827.24, It's more like a witcher kind of thing.
4827.24,4829.0," They're very distinct, like, okay,"
4829.0,4831.88, now go to the top of this volcano and stop like the prostitute
4831.88,4834.08, thing I was talking about before is part of the nighttime
4834.08,4834.92, quest chain.
4834.92,4838.72," So they're more like a standard, like, never-winter nights"
4838.72,4840.32," kind of experience, whatever."
4840.32,4843.6, So everything is very linear and very scripted.
4843.6,4846.360000000001," Like, okay, now go find this one flower hidden here"
4846.360000000001,4848.56, and it's not killing 30 boroughs or anything.
4848.56,4851.4400000000005," So that, pretty much what it is."
4851.4400000000005,4853.280000000001," They just said, okay, we're taking care of MMO mechanics"
4853.280000000001,4855.6, and making the witcher and everyone
4855.6,4857.0, or nights out of it for a little while.
4857.0,4858.160000000001, So I don't know.
4858.160000000001,4862.04, I can't speak to the PvP here building your own cities
4862.04,4864.6, or any of the stuff that it read the game really is.
4864.6,4867.6," When you get past this, but for the beginning,"
4867.6,4870.92," it's kind of a, it's a really bizarre solution."
4870.92,4873.88," It's kind of like they gave up on the idea and just said,"
4873.88,4877.52," okay, we're gonna try to hook you by giving you the game"
4877.52,4879.96, that's not really the game first.
4879.96,4883.0," So anyway, so this revolutionary idea,"
4883.0,4885.0," you're talking about, yeah, there's three buttons."
4885.0,4887.72," Every character has, instead of just an auto attack button"
4887.72,4889.56," where you know, most of them as you're just targeting them"
4889.56,4891.96," and you have three,"
4891.96,4893.4," black MMOs, black MMOs."
4893.4,4894.24, Black MMOs.
4894.24,4896.6, They have a left-atop and a right.
4896.6,4900.8, So character like the NPCs will have these little shield icons.
4900.8,4903.400000000001, Either on the side or the top or the right of them.
4903.400000000001,4904.24, Yeah.
4904.24,4905.88, And they'll switch them around like over time
4905.88,4907.76, so you just gotta kind of be paying attention.
4907.76,4908.6, Right.
4908.6,4909.76, That's the revolution.
4909.76,4911.96," Every little bit helps, especially if you're tank,"
4911.96,4915.24," you know, and all your normally doing is just sitting there."
4915.24,4916.76, Who's eaten?
4916.76,4919.2, Gross ass mouth like this.
4919.2,4920.84," I'm chewing fucking out of him, dude."
4920.84,4921.68, I'm sorry.
4921.68,4923.400000000001," It does make you, you know, it does for you to pay attention"
4923.400000000001,4924.8, if you stop.
4924.8,4926.88, If you don't press a button like you're just gonna stand there
4926.88,4928.320000000001, and die or as in more of the work.
4928.320000000001,4929.88, That doesn't seem like a bad thing.
4929.88,4932.68, I think that's funny is that like I keep talking about it
4932.68,4935.36, over and over again and it's kind of a reminder of like how
4935.36,4938.12," little innovation and yes, there is an MMO."
4938.12,4939.8," Yeah, if this is what the getting people excited."
4939.8,4941.36," Yeah, changing."
4941.36,4945.6," Now, and there's, they do combos too, which is not something"
4945.6,4947.400000000001, Final Fantasy kind of has combos too.
4947.400000000001,4948.88," Cobbles, combos."
4948.88,4949.4800000000005, Cobbles.
4949.4800000000005,4951.8, Not a big deal for MMO.
4951.8,4955.4800000000005, The PVP domains sound interesting to me
4955.4800000000005,4958.8," and that they're like, you don't go into a designated PVP"
4958.8,4959.8, session.
4959.8,4961.04, You can just gain someone at any point.
4961.04,4963.4800000000005," So that means we can go in, get to like level six and then wait"
4963.4800000000005,4966.400000000001, at the starting area and kill everyone that just joins the game
4966.400000000001,4967.400000000001, after they make their account.
4967.400000000001,4970.2," I think you have to be on a PVP server, though."
4970.2,4971.04," Yeah, on a PVP server."
4971.04,4972.04, Yeah.
4972.04,4973.4800000000005," Okay, so that's anywhere."
4973.4800000000005,4973.84, I don't know.
4973.84,4974.4800000000005, I haven't tried it.
4974.4800000000005,4974.84, Right.
4974.84,4976.4400000000005," What you could do that in, wow, if you want to."
4976.4400000000005,4977.72, You're trying to PVP server.
4977.72,4979.4400000000005," Even then, though, you can try."
4979.4400000000005,4982.28," And even then, though, there is certain rules about the newbies"
4982.28,4983.28, on and stuff.
4983.28,4984.28, Are there?
4984.28,4985.28, Yeah.
4985.28,4988.08," Like, if it's a contested area versus like,"
4988.8,4990.28, my safe zone.
4990.28,4993.36," I got into like, if Emma most, if I got into them"
4993.36,4995.36," when they first came out, you know, the ultimal line there,"
4995.36,4997.5199999999995," I like, they might have been one of my favorite genres."
4997.5199999999995,4999.36," Yeah, you know, I just missed like, you would have"
4999.36,5000.72, liked the wild west.
5000.72,5002.72," Do you understand like now that, yeah, I mean,"
5002.72,5005.68, that of course people don't want to pay a subscription fee
5005.68,5007.08, when that kind of shit's happening to them.
5007.08,5007.6, And it's right.
5007.6,5010.36," Funny, it's like me when I hear someone come in and make a"
5010.36,5011.84," borerad joke, you know."
5011.84,5015.8," But it's like, yeah, they're so they just fostered creativity."
5015.8,5017.56," There's just so many like, and genius."
5017.56,5021.360000000001," Right, but they have to put in the rules for people like you."
5021.360000000001,5024.76," Or like Ryan, don't even pass on me, Ryan's got to tell you"
5024.76,5025.4400000000005, of war stories.
5025.4400000000005,5026.28," Yeah, no, you're right."
5026.28,5027.08, Sure.
5027.08,5028.88," No, I did it too, and ultimal online."
5028.88,5030.400000000001, I totally did.
5030.400000000001,5032.2, What would you do?
5032.2,5033.4400000000005," Well, they weren't that bad."
5033.4400000000005,5037.84, The one that stands out that I always tell was when I
5037.84,5041.16, walked into this one like little castle area where these
5041.16,5044.28," dudes were all holding a guild meeting, you know,"
5044.28,5046.08, inside this castle.
5046.08,5048.84, And they were talking all serious and shit.
5048.84,5051.599999999999, And I've been in this place.
5051.599999999999,5055.2," Yeah, and I just like, I just walked up and I sat down at the table."
5055.2,5057.5199999999995, There's some guy got up from his seat at the table.
5057.5199999999995,5059.4, So I went there and I sat down.
5059.4,5060.92," And then I'll go on like, who are you?"
5060.92,5061.679999999999," Like, leave."
5061.679999999999,5065.16," And I'm like, and this was like, anybody see Alphlast night?"
5065.16,5066.92, That's like type of shit like that.
5066.92,5068.48," And they were like, get the fuck out of here."
5068.48,5069.92, Like we're having a guild meeting.
5069.92,5071.28, And I just was ignoring them.
5071.28,5074.12," Like, man, I was just like typing just stupid, like,"
5074.12,5075.08, jolly bullshit.
5075.08,5076.08," Yeah, the game let me do this."
5076.08,5076.759999999999, Right.
5076.759999999999,5079.32," And they, I broke up the meeting."
5079.32,5080.48," They were all like, fuck this guy."
5080.48,5080.96, Let's leave.
5080.96,5082.4, And they all like left the room.
5082.4,5083.88, And I felt so victorious.
5083.88,5086.28," It's like, but you could do that now and anything."
5086.28,5089.88," No, that's not like an exploitation of a ruleset, though."
5089.88,5091.4," It's still a red story, but I'm just like,"
5091.4,5093.8," no, I guess, yeah, couch in the conversation."
5093.8,5094.4," No, you're right."
5094.4,5098.8, It's not the same thing as like I sat at the newbie spawn point
5098.8,5099.759999999999, and ganked everybody.
5099.76,5101.72," We used it like in the ultimate online,"
5101.72,5103.84," we would go into a dungeon and Trent and like,"
5103.84,5105.8, we were a bunch of monsters toward the entrance.
5105.8,5106.320000000001, Sure.
5106.320000000001,5108.84, And then we would go outside and wait for somebody to come in
5108.84,5110.64, and put like tables in front of the entrance.
5110.64,5113.56, So they couldn't get out and the monsters would kill them.
5113.56,5117.0, The training in every quest was also another fun one.
5117.0,5117.52," Oh, God."
5117.52,5119.400000000001, The every quest that sounds had had a lot.
5119.400000000001,5120.88, Like I was listening to the guys and the thing
5120.88,5122.320000000001, talked about the shit that they're doing and something
5122.320000000001,5124.0, every quest is pretty right for it too.
5124.0,5128.52, All those games were items have like a weight statistic.
5128.52,5130.52, And so that you're able to actually throw
5130.52,5132.96, somehow you're able to impose the objects on someone else
5132.96,5134.64, so that they suddenly can't move or you can trick them
5134.64,5136.96, into picking up something and it weighs like a moon.
5136.96,5137.96, It sounds like a moon.
5137.96,5138.76," And then you just like,"
5138.76,5139.6, a couple of it.
5139.6,5141.0," Yeah, right."
5141.0,5142.96, So they give you all those different things to them.
5142.96,5146.0, Exploiting things with like stealing people's houses
5146.0,5147.84, and like locking yourself inside of them
5147.84,5150.280000000001, and then like logging off like always logging off.
5150.280000000001,5153.120000000001," They always like, you're free to cut."
5153.120000000001,5155.68, Like they were saying that like sometimes people would
5155.68,5157.400000000001, have so much loot they couldn't physically carry it.
5157.4,5158.5599999999995, So they'd have to drop it.
5158.5599999999995,5160.839999999999," It's like, to create, drop it again."
5160.839999999999,5162.92, But every time it's dropped it's physically in the world.
5162.92,5165.759999999999, So Ryan would come out of the bushes and grab it and lock off.
5165.759999999999,5169.48, You can put it in cooking monster.
5169.48,5171.32, I'm fucking everywhere.
5171.32,5172.32, Cookin' everyone's cooking.
5172.32,5173.32," Yeah, no."
5173.32,5174.32," It's sad because like, yeah."
5174.32,5177.08, I'm most of these days are so safe guarded against like any sort
5177.08,5178.48, of things that people get mad.
5178.48,5180.36, They feel like they got to get mad about something.
5180.36,5181.36, So I remember.
5181.36,5184.4," Even if it's just like, it's a kill stealing button."
5184.4,5188.0, Which is just the definition of kill stealing in like warcraft
5188.0,5190.719999999999, is you got to the monster first and the person thought they should
5190.719999999999,5191.719999999999, have.
5191.719999999999,5193.96, Kill stealing is absolutely not the same as it used to be.
5193.96,5194.96, Right.
5194.96,5195.96, Really was.
5195.96,5196.96, There isn't no kill stealing anymore.
5196.96,5198.839999999999," Wasn't that one like, and ever questioned, a bunch of like 15"
5198.839999999999,5201.639999999999, groups would sit around and wait for the boss to spawn.
5201.639999999999,5202.639999999999, You'd have to do it.
5202.639999999999,5204.36, You would do camp checks back in the day.
5204.36,5206.16," You would just go camp check, whatever."
5206.16,5208.16," Something, whatever."
5208.16,5209.759999999999," You know, weeping for us."
5209.759999999999,5211.28, I can't even remember any of the names now.
5211.28,5214.2," And then you know, so, and you would do that to see if somebody"
5214.2,5215.88, else was sitting there waiting for the monster.
5215.88,5216.88, Right.
5216.88,5217.88, There'd be a line basically.
5217.88,5218.88," Yeah, you'd be waiting in line that comes."
5218.88,5219.88, How instant is it?
5219.88,5220.88, Isn't this it?
5220.88,5221.88, Right.
5221.88,5224.72, Ravroster always ran against just that like you talk these games.
5224.72,5228.88," That is enormous potential for you know, just these interesting social"
5228.88,5231.599999999999, outcomes and you make them into these enforced utopias.
5231.599999999999,5232.599999999999, Yeah.
5232.599999999999,5234.16," For everyone has, there's a rules or universal."
5234.16,5236.76, Everyone can't help it abide by him because they have no choice.
5236.76,5237.76, Right.
5237.76,5238.76, Wow.
5238.76,5239.76, And totally enforce you.
5239.76,5240.76," And now, I was like New Zealand."
5240.76,5242.36," So yeah, and all you do is get the fucking wolf pal."
5242.36,5243.36, That's why I hate him.
5243.36,5248.4," That's a good, like another way for me to understand why this shit is so"
5248.4,5249.24, absolutely boring.
5249.24,5250.24, I tried to do it.
5250.24,5253.599999999999," And I always hit this wall after a well, you have to, you know, you're either"
5253.599999999999,5260.5599999999995," opting into this sort of, yeah, the sort of, you know, that you're going to"
5260.5599999999995,5264.4, plan to their rules and you're going to sort of get into this community spirit
5264.4,5265.4, thing.
5265.4,5268.44," But if you're looking for a wild west thing, you're, it absolutely does not exist"
5268.44,5269.44, in wild.
5269.44,5270.44, I killed it completely.
5270.44,5271.44, Yeah.
5271.44,5276.2," And I think back and ever quest in retrospect, it does feel like what you're saying."
5276.2,5278.679999999999," Like I, like I have so many memories of it."
5278.679999999999,5282.679999999999," And I was a victim probably more than I was was a grief, but that was a future."
5282.679999999999,5283.679999999999, They do it on foot.
5283.679999999999,5284.679999999999, But no.
5284.679999999999,5287.4," But it was, but even just that, just like, you know, part of logging in every"
5287.4,5290.759999999999," night was like, you know, there was like an element of danger there."
5290.759999999999,5291.759999999999, Yeah.
5291.759999999999,5295.0," No, or some guy going to fuck with me, you know, and I'm going to get, you know,"
5295.0,5298.08, is there going to be a train of like 80 goals coming at me?
5298.08,5299.08, Yeah.
5299.08,5301.08," She's so, so awesome."
5301.16,5302.08, Yeah.
5302.08,5303.08, No.
5303.08,5306.24," And fantasy star online, they was like, there's no market or trading window or anything."
5306.24,5308.12," So it was like, it was all the all the other systems."
5308.12,5309.12," It's just like you're saying, Wild West."
5309.12,5310.12, You're all right.
5310.12,5311.12, I got this egg blaster.
5311.12,5312.12, You got this item.
5312.12,5313.5599999999995, We're going to both set them down.
5313.5599999999995,5315.32, So you both set them down in 10 places.
5315.32,5317.4," And of course, and then you want that each other."
5317.4,5319.0," And you pick his up and you're like, fuck you."
5319.0,5320.72, It's a single percent of whatever it is.
5320.72,5322.6," He's like, well, yeah, well, guess what I got."
5322.6,5323.6, And it's like the same thing.
5323.6,5324.96," And you're like, all right, let's do it again."
5324.96,5325.96, You do it again.
5325.96,5327.32," And again, you do like six times in a row."
5327.32,5330.16," And you're like, oh, obviously no trade is going to happen."
5330.16,5331.16, Yeah.
5331.16,5332.16, Trust each other.
5332.16,5333.16, She that's not fun.
5333.16,5334.5599999999995," But that's like, that was fun."
5334.5599999999995,5335.88, It was like fun to think about.
5335.88,5336.88, This is interesting.
5336.88,5337.88, This is happening.
5337.88,5338.96, This is like challenging me.
5338.96,5340.719999999999," Like, I'm challenging my mind."
5340.719999999999,5346.24, And then I'm actually trying to do to trick this guy or the outsmart someone or to do something
5346.24,5347.96, in the way that interact with real people.
5347.96,5352.599999999999," But in a hostile way that I normally wouldn't in my day to day living is opposed to,"
5352.599999999999,5357.0," like, how do I, how do I find 49th and 4th or the 50th board?"
5357.24,5358.48," And go, let's go to the faculty."
5358.48,5359.92," Oh, he's hiding in the dark woods."
5359.92,5366.36," Like that's, but most people out there probably aren't getting into games so that they can,"
5366.36,5372.44," like, you know, escape into a world of the of the of information and petty blackmail."
5372.44,5374.24," Oh, I got it."
5374.24,5377.92, They're looking for a location from that sort of thing.
5377.92,5379.88, Most people actually like Disney land.
5379.88,5381.36, They wouldn't like Disney land.
5381.36,5383.28," They don't want to actually know, but he enforces anything."
5383.28,5386.24, There's a chance it's based mountain dropped you right in the pit.
5386.24,5386.719999999999, Hell.
5386.719999999999,5387.5199999999995, Exactly.
5387.5199999999995,5388.04, Yeah.
5388.04,5390.04, People that take vacations to you.
5390.04,5393.24," This thing has a bit of safety checked in five years, but good luck."
5393.24,5395.04," And again, I have to read it."
5395.04,5396.5199999999995," I think I've said this every time, well, comes up."
5396.5199999999995,5401.639999999999," But like, to me, the reason I keep playing is because of the five man instances and the"
5401.639999999999,5405.04," raids, which are just on a completely different level than killing 40 bars."
5405.04,5406.04, Yeah.
5406.04,5407.04, Right.
5407.04,5408.04, Say that.
5408.04,5409.04, Right.
5409.04,5410.04," Again, it's, that's a whole other game to me."
5410.04,5411.04, Right.
5411.04,5412.04, Then it's more like a strategy game.
5412.04,5413.04, Right.
5413.04,5417.26," Like, you know, a bunch of people, you like, you know, coming up with strategies to like"
5417.26,5421.88, figure out this crazy weird encounter that the designers have come up with.
5421.88,5423.64," That's, it's like a, it's a puzzle game."
5423.64,5424.64, Right.
5424.64,5426.5199999999995," And like, a level you don't normally encounter puzzles."
5426.5199999999995,5429.84, So that's when the game really is something.
5429.84,5431.32, And it is a different thing.
5431.32,5435.2," It's like nothing like the, the collecting wolf pulse part of it."
5435.2,5436.2, Yeah.
5436.2,5437.2," It's high level rating, man."
5437.2,5441.12," I mean, I, I love to have a game that didn't, that you just let you skip."
5441.12,5443.4, Have you ever referred yourself as a Raid hero?
5443.4,5444.4, Yeah.
5444.4,5445.4," God, no."
5445.4,5450.76, I would love a game that let you just like skip straight into like the equivalent
5450.76,5451.76, of level 60 or something.
5451.76,5453.64," And wow, just to get into that part of it."
5453.64,5454.64, Yeah.
5454.64,5457.76," So, what about the game that's just that part of it?"
5457.76,5458.76, I would love that game.
5458.76,5460.4, I don't know why anyone knows.
5460.4,5461.64, I don't know that yet.
5461.64,5465.44," So do you have any, go ahead and get feeling yet about age of going in?"
5465.44,5466.44, Yeah.
5466.44,5467.44, It's another memo.
5467.44,5470.12," Even, even though I haven't played the MMO part, like you could tell."
5470.2,5474.88," How like I know my class is this, it's a, it's a neckerman's or which is, you know,"
5474.88,5477.08, kind of like a neckerman's or any other game.
5477.08,5481.48," It's like a con sum in, some goblums and their pets and you have some dots and"
5481.48,5482.48, you have some buffers.
5482.48,5483.48, Yeah.
5483.48,5486.48," I mean, if you play it MMOs, you know how it works."
5486.48,5489.4," Whether even neckermanches like in the cone in books, I don't even know."
5489.4,5491.76," What are, what are some of the other like missions you had?"
5491.76,5495.2, Like what's the dopiest like early level objective you'd have?
5495.2,5496.2, Turn around.
5496.2,5497.88, Don't want to tell me about last night.
5498.84,5500.24, Was it from the story park?
5500.24,5501.08, Probably won't see.
5501.08,5502.8," Oh, this is from the multiplayer part."
5502.8,5503.8," Oh, yeah."
5503.8,5505.28, I haven't really gotten done too many of those.
5505.28,5508.68," I mean, I have a ton in my quest log and it's like, like, you know,"
5508.68,5510.0, kill all of you this plant.
5510.0,5513.96," Oh, I'm not sure because it wasn't much of a joke anyway, but basically just do the"
5513.96,5516.84," Schwarzenegger accent and fill in the like I've come here to like,"
5516.84,5519.4800000000005, exc mission and hear the limitations of your women.
5519.4800000000005,5521.28," Like the whole time you're playing, right?"
5521.28,5524.56, You got to do that for whatever your your objective is and sometimes it makes
5524.56,5526.76," for some pretty good, pretty good pair."
5526.76,5527.28, Yeah.
5527.36,5531.32, I can not speak to the authenticity of a condensary.
5531.32,5535.2," First, yeah, no idea what it was really like."
5535.2,5537.04, And how about the stability?
5537.04,5541.84, Because I was hearing yesterday some folks talking about it being pretty unstable for
5541.84,5543.28, something that's just a lot.
5543.28,5546.88," So a few weeks, I've never had a crash."
5546.88,5547.599999999999, That's like every.
5547.599999999999,5551.92," And then, though, though, to me, I get frame rate issues and stuff."
5551.92,5553.5199999999995, And I have a pretty good machine.
5553.5199999999995,5554.759999999999, It's hitching and stuff.
5554.84,5561.24," But it hasn't crashed ever, which is something I can really say about an MMO in the beta."
5561.24,5562.24, And my egg is.
5562.24,5565.24, It's ever as a be either because I can't go down it.
5565.24,5567.4400000000005," But I mean, it is, you know, there are bugs."
5567.4400000000005,5568.4400000000005, Yeah.
5568.4400000000005,5573.0," When you do talk to a quest guy, sometimes it doesn't quite work right or, you know,"
5573.0,5574.8, it takes forever for the cutscene below.
5574.8,5578.72," And it does have little cutscenes with like, interactive dialogue trees for most of the"
5578.72,5579.72, stuff.
5579.72,5580.72," Oh, yeah."
5580.72,5581.72, And they talk.
5581.72,5582.72, I don't know if that's good.
5582.72,5583.72, I do.
5583.72,5584.72, Right.
5584.72,5586.92," No, Conan is the king somewhere else."
5586.92,5590.16," And he figures into, I guess, or he'll be Conan that be dumb."
5590.16,5591.16, It's all of Conan.
5591.16,5592.56, Here's like you're a slave.
5592.56,5593.72, I don't know if you've lost your memory.
5593.72,5594.72," Yeah, you have lost your memory."
5594.72,5595.72, Of course.
5595.72,5596.72," Oh, of course you have."
5596.72,5597.72, Yeah.
5597.72,5603.04," And if I made a story oriented massive multiplayer online RPG, yeah."
5603.04,5608.56, I would make it so that I was the hero and everyone else just had to stand around and
5608.56,5610.68, sell me stuff.
5610.68,5612.68, That would be how I think that.
5612.68,5613.68, Yeah.
5613.68,5617.96," Would be like, I'd be the character and everyone else would play some"
5617.96,5618.96, menial role.
5618.96,5621.84," You know, they would be like, well, would you like to buy a broadsword or."
5621.84,5623.240000000001, So we beat your NPC space.
5623.240000000001,5625.04," Yeah, that's how it should work."
5625.04,5626.04, Conan's reach.
5626.04,5629.200000000001," And if you play a majesty, jeper play majesty."
5629.200000000001,5630.200000000001, Yeah.
5630.200000000001,5631.200000000001, I love that game.
5631.200000000001,5632.200000000001, That's fantastic.
5632.200000000001,5633.68," We're like dungeon keeper, that kind of thing."
5633.68,5634.68, Yeah.
5634.68,5636.8, You're the boss controlling all the little hero minions.
5636.8,5638.8, I feel bad for King.
5638.8,5641.4400000000005, And he's head was just on the phone on.
5641.4400000000005,5643.4400000000005, I can't get him to talk anymore.
5643.44,5644.44, Anyone else play?
5644.44,5645.44," Oh, he doesn't talk anymore."
5645.44,5646.44, To the batteries out.
5646.44,5648.44, But it's a third battery.
5648.44,5649.44, Oh.
5649.44,5651.44, Anyone else play Assassin's Creed PC?
5651.44,5652.44, No.
5652.44,5653.44," We, uh, no."
5653.44,5656.44, We didn't get any copies here for next week when I've played more.
5656.44,5658.44, And hopefully someone else has played some to.
5658.44,5659.44, I played the X-Ball.
5659.44,5661.44," Oh, yeah, I went and bought it."
5661.44,5662.44, Surprisingly you bought it.
5662.44,5663.44, Yeah.
5663.44,5664.44, You would have had to.
5664.44,5665.44, Yeah.
5665.44,5666.44, Yeah.
5666.44,5667.44, Why a job.
5667.44,5668.44, So I'm moving on.
5668.44,5669.44," No, but it would be cool."
5669.44,5670.44, If I had a blabber to the bottom.
5670.44,5671.44, Get it in again.
5671.44,5672.44, Another copy on here so we can.
5672.44,5673.44," Yeah, I don't see myself fighting."
5673.44,5675.44, I'm interested in someone I've heard.
5675.44,5676.44," Yeah, I don't think so."
5676.44,5678.44, I'm not talking about it.
5678.44,5679.44, All right.
5679.44,5680.44, I've been playing Grim Fan Dango.
5680.44,5681.44, Let me borrow it.
5681.44,5682.44," Oh, God."
5682.44,5683.44, I love that game.
5683.44,5684.44, Yeah.
5684.44,5686.44, I bought the discs from eBay.
5686.44,5687.44, I've been enjoying it.
5687.44,5689.44, How much did you pay?
5689.44,5690.44, $10.
5690.44,5691.44, Nice.
5691.44,5692.44, Yeah.
5692.44,5693.44, Yeah.
5693.44,5694.44, Which one's better?
5694.44,5695.44, Just a brilliant.
5695.44,5696.44," Oh, I don't know."
5696.44,5700.44, I've sort of interested in playing a playing an adventure game.
5700.44,5706.44," But not interested in playing something like super arcane, even though it's pretty arcane."
5706.44,5710.44," I mean, I basically play it by having the game FAQ open at all times."
5710.44,5714.44," And if I get frustrated for even like five minutes, I go straight to it."
5714.44,5715.44, Mm-hmm.
5715.44,5716.44, I think that's there.
5716.44,5717.44, Yeah.
5717.44,5719.44, There were some tough puzzles in my game.
5719.44,5720.44, Yeah.
5720.44,5721.44, There's some stuff that's outrageously ridiculous.
5721.44,5722.44, Yeah.
5722.44,5726.44," But like story wise, I love to character a lot."
5726.44,5728.44, And this really funny.
5728.44,5729.44, Mm-hmm.
5729.44,5736.44, I kind of humor that is so stylish and fun.
5736.44,5740.44, It makes a lot of other stuff seem kind of soulless.
5740.44,5741.44, Yeah.
5741.44,5746.44, Plus the guy who does all the voice for a mini-calavera is a Benny's dad and ugly-beddy.
5746.44,5747.44, Really?
5747.44,5748.44, Yeah.
5748.44,5752.44," So every time, you know, when I watch that show with my family, every time he talks,"
5752.44,5754.44, it's a mini-calavera.
5754.44,5755.44, Every time.
5755.44,5756.44, Every time.
5756.44,5757.44, Every time.
5757.44,5774.0599999999995, I
5774.0599999999995,5785.44," really, you guys know what I mean."
5785.44,5789.48," something that'll ever happen. Yeah, I was just sad loss. I mean, they're priority. I mean,"
5789.48,5794.919999999999," yeah, Star Wars. I mean, but they had such a gold mine of great games back then that"
5794.919999999999,5800.719999999999," were not Star Wars, you know, the full throttle, salmon max. They had a mechanical maniac"
5800.719999999999,5806.12," mansion. It's Tisnor and they just wanted to go. They just peed her to lay that. Yeah,"
5806.12,5811.12, those Indian and Jones games were just as good as all their other ones. Yeah. Yeah. It's
5811.12,5816.44," really a grim fan, Dan goes really, really, I think imaginative. I like, I remember"
5816.44,5823.5599999999995," the first time I saw the, what do they call it? Flowering or blooming. Like, that's how"
5823.5599999999995,5828.48, that's how people get killed in the game. Because they're dead in the underworld. They're
5828.48,5833.44," skeletons walking around when they get, there's a way of killing people that involves them"
5833.44,5839.04, like sprouting into this like garden of flowers. And it's really cool looking and also just
5839.04,5844.88," kind of a strange cool concept. Yeah. Kind of like Oh, comic. Yeah. Yeah, except it's the whole"
5844.88,5850.92," thing has that, you know, more detective movie. Right. He had, he had, I remember when I interviewed"
5850.92,5856.92," him at the time, he had the screen. He'd be, uh, to chip for. Chimchay for thank you. Yeah."
5856.92,5863.36," Sorry. Right. Grimfen, thank you. Yeah. When I interviewed Mandy Calabara in the underworld,"
5863.44,5870.36, Tim Chafer had the Chinatown screenplay on his desk as kind of like reference and inspiration.
5870.36,5877.92," Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely shows. I, I, I, I'm hoping that I will finish it and not just"
5877.92,5881.759999999999, keep playing Grand Theft Auto for 25 hours a week. This is a bit about halfway through.
5881.759999999999,5886.5599999999995," This two little packin that came with it. You know, remember that plastic, manny, that you"
5886.5599999999995,5890.759999999999," pressed the bottom and, oh, yeah. He would flop or whatever. Still have that on a shelf."
5890.76,5895.280000000001," Dude, my favorite piece of crap that ever came with a game. Do you like it more"
5895.280000000001,5899.400000000001," than this kind thing? Little bit. Obviously, you wouldn't like this, but because that"
5899.400000000001,5905.4400000000005, can is provided you with hours and entertainment. You should take a picture of this
5905.4400000000005,5909.84," video on the podcast blog. So, man, don't forget how ready he is. He's like, you've got"
5909.84,5915.52, a cow. Very detailed. He gets some red in there. Get some blood. Thank you. Very
5915.52,5918.8," serious. I was, she's the whole time we're playing this strong enough to take that like"
5918.8,5922.52, resin cast and snap it in half. I'd love to just get fucking violent with that.
5922.52,5927.0, You know what? You don't have to cry. Why? I'm shocked. You're always breaking my mouth.
5927.0,5929.96," You're a cool can. Well, I already ripped the head off. That was about the limit of my"
5929.96,5933.52," strength. I mean, what did this is some pretty sturdy material? If you go into my office,"
5933.52,5938.96, you look in that that sand garden I got from some other game. Ever question. Yeah. Did I try
5938.96,5943.400000000001," a part? Yeah. And then in the sand garden, there's like body parts in there. I think"
5943.4,5948.12," it's like a dead. So, one scent, a zen scent, you know, zen rock and sand garden where"
5948.12,5952.879999999999," you're supposed to rake, you know, paddocks that represent the cosmos around the rocks"
5952.879999999999,5958.0, and in the gravel. And it's just loaded with like just torn up pieces of ever quest action
5958.0,5964.5199999999995," figure like and other stuff. There's also the, the, the, oh, and what we also did was we"
5964.5199999999995,5970.599999999999, took the mirror that came from the last Grand Theft Auto game. Santa the career. The
5970.6,5974.92," air coke mirror. And we took the sand. That was by city, right? It was by city. Yeah."
5974.92,5978.92," Cause it's, that had that had the mirror. Yeah. We took the sand from that sand garden"
5978.92,5984.240000000001, and we made lines and we put it out on the wall. I think it's so depressing when you open
5984.240000000001,5989.04," up one of those packages and it's got some little piece of like, you know, plastic crap"
5989.04,5993.160000000001," in there that is eventually going to have to like go in the trash because eventually, even"
5993.160000000001,5999.04," if you put it out. Not even if you put it out on the street, like nobody picks it up."
5999.04,6002.24," I do that in my neighborhood. I was like, put stuff out on the street. Yeah. I'll walk my"
6002.24,6006.68," day later and be like, yeah, that's what Darren was good for. You could just give it to him."
6006.68,6012.0," You know what Anthony, who probably be on next week, we're driving around like that. We're"
6012.0,6016.36," driving driving around at Berkeley. And all of a sudden, like, you know, his roommate in the"
6016.36,6020.36, car and me and then like he'll just like periodically slam the brakes and pull over a little
6020.36,6023.76," bit and just get out. We're like, what the fuck's he doing? He's going to be like, oh,"
6023.76,6027.32," he must have saw something on the side street and like, he'll run and he gets some old,"
6027.32,6031.04," like, dishwreck or something that was sitting on the curb, we run up throughout the"
6031.04,6034.44," backseat with me. Then like, the next weekend, you know, you'll go out again. It's like,"
6034.44,6038.36," there it is. And the backseat is car still. It's like being with Fred Sanford. Yeah,"
6038.36,6048.96," it's here. Get shit for the yard. Get for it. For exactly. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. Oh,"
6048.96,6053.96, where are we nearing a wrap-up time there? Let's continue. Yeah. We have another podcast
6053.96,6059.32," to do three of us here. You have to sit here. Oh, okay. You know, you guys see lost last"
6059.32,6063.92, week. Yeah. Yeah. That was a not good one. Not a good one. I don't think I heard it was
6063.92,6069.56," an episode for was filler. Trying to come up with terms like J and being, you know,"
6069.56,6075.12," Jack and Kate. Oh, that's the thing. Yeah. They're the new team. They just need to die."
6075.12,6080.24," Wow. Well, there's just a filler. But so then what do I do? Yeah, that was a thing. Oh,"
6080.24,6084.2," we did was find out like what we knew was going to happen. The Jack was going to, you know,"
6084.2,6089.719999999999, start going to seed and want to go back to the island. Right. All right. You that already.
6089.719999999999,6093.36, We got to get back. Didn't that episode. Didn't this start it. It's hard to start that way.
6093.36,6096.96," That's how the last season. Yeah. That's what ended. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. It's just,"
6096.96,6100.96, it's a point list of me. Fill your episode. And you know what? It's been an explain and
6100.96,6105.5599999999995, it explained something that didn't need explaining. And then it's explanation was just all.
6105.5599999999995,6110.0," Right. Kate was in the shower, though. I just like his descent into madness began with,"
6110.0,6115.28," like the most stupid of the reason. Like I know, whatever. Okay. I think I think on an"
6115.28,6118.8," episode of Lost once on TV and I watched it for like 10 minutes and I swear to God,"
6118.8,6124.52, the entire time was just one long tracking shot of people not talking like staring at
6124.52,6130.32, things that I didn't understand. Nice. That could have been. Yeah. I think her lead in the
6130.32,6136.04," coffin. Her lead. Certainly. Yeah. I think after that last episode, I think that's what"
6136.12,6142.12, it is. I think he's gonna all fothin' off himself. The coffin didn't look that big.
6142.12,6150.28," That would have been a dead giveaway though. What else would they do? Why would they be like,"
6150.28,6155.72," oh, I don't why would you want to go see her Lee? That doesn't make sense. Yeah. Yeah."
6155.72,6160.28, Who would they not want to go to her Lee's funeral? What are the other other theories? I
6160.28,6164.6," didn't watch this last episode. I think it's Vincent's. Well, your theory is that they all played"
6164.6,6168.76," on the same McDonald's, swing set. The dog. I thought that was the dog. She"
6168.76,6173.240000000001, took it to the dog and the coffin. Yes. Why did we never win? I still want to see how bad
6173.240000000001,6178.52," that game is. The lost. No, I didn't. I keep saying maybe I should play that. That"
6178.52,6182.120000000001," one I look at my stack of games that are actually good that I haven't played. Yeah, exactly."
6182.120000000001,6186.360000000001, And haven't touched it. That's what I'll try. Do you have it in office? It'll be soft. No.
6188.68,6192.92, That's why we never played an awkward silence. We did. I don't know if it's worth
6192.92,6197.96, money though. I really want to be in the margins now. He begins this week. This week's episode is a
6197.96,6206.2, lock at the so that'll be it is. There's some guy in the trailer is new. That guy is not new. The guy
6206.2,6211.16," who's like, I've been dead for 12 years. That's the dude. Remember the other janitor dude who brought"
6211.16,6217.56, Ben and his dad to the island? It doesn't remember him. That's that dude. Okay. Okay. We need to
6217.56,6224.4400000000005," consult Ryan's loss spreadsheet. He was in episode 3.2. Yeah, that guy. He was in 20 minutes. I"
6224.4400000000005,6231.240000000001," recognized the actor because he was in X files. Did you like this episode, Ryan? I thought it was"
6231.240000000001,6237.320000000001, a thing. Could you? Could you not like an episode? I'm just asking. Would you be able to say
6237.320000000001,6243.160000000001," this one sucked? Oh, there's plenty of episodes. Could you say the episode issue of the green"
6243.24,6251.24," lantern sucked? I'm going to think about that one. Oh, come on. You're years of green lantern"
